The estimation of surface PM2:5 concentrations has made intensive use of satellitederived aerosol products. However, it has been a great challenge to obtain high-quality and high-resolution PM2:5 data from both ground and satellite observations, which is essential to monitor air pollution over small-scale areas such as metropolitan regions. Here, the space-time extremely randomized trees (STET) model was enhanced by integrating updated spatiotemporal information and additional auxiliary data to improve the spatial resolution and overall accuracy of PM2:5 estimates across China. To this end, the newly released Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction AOD product, along with meteorological, topographical and land-use data and pollution emissions, was input to the STET model, and daily 1 km PM2:5 maps for 2018 covering mainland China were produced. The STET model performed well, with a high out-of-sample (out-of-station) cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89 (0.88), a low rootmean-square error of 10.33 (10.93) ?gm-3, a small mean absolute error of 6.69 (7.15) ?gm-3 and a small mean relative error of 21.28% (23.69 %). In particular, the model captured well the PM2:5 concentrations at both regional and individual site scales. The North China Plain, the Sichuan Basin and Xinjiang Province always featured high PM2:5 pollution levels, especially in winter. The STET model outperformed most models presented in previous related studies, with a strong predictive power (e.g., monthly R2 D 0:80), which can be used to estimate historical PM2:5 records. More importantly, this study provides a new approach for obtaining high-resolution and high-quality PM2:5 dataset across mainland China (i.e., ChinaHighPM2:5), important for air pollution studies focused on urban areas.

This study attempts to establish a multi-time, multi-site forecasting model of Beijing's air quality by using deep learning network models based on spatiotemporal clustering and to compare them with a back-propagation neural network (BPNN). For the overall forecasting, the performances in next-hour forecasting were ranked in ascending order of the BPNN, the convolutional neural network (CNN), the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and the CNN-LSTM, with the LSTM as the optimal model in the multiple-hour forecasting. The performance of the seasonal forecasting was not significantly improved compared to the overall forecasting. For the spatial clustering-based forecasting, cluster 2 forecasting generally outperforms cluster 1 and the overall forecasting. Overall, either the seasonal or the spatial clustering-based forecasting is more suitable for the improvement of the forecasting in a certain season or cluster.

Accordingly, a full-coverage high-resolution air pollutant data set with timely updates and historical long-term records is essential to support both research and environmental management. Here, for the first time, we develop a near real-time air pollutant database known as Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP, http://tapdata.org.cn/) that combines information from multiple data sources, including ground observations, satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), operational chemical transport model simulations, and other ancillary data such as meteorological fields, land use data, population, and elevation. Daily full-coverage PM2.5 data at a spatial resolution of 10 km is our first near real-time product. The TAP PM2.5 is estimated based on a two-stage machine learning model coupled with the synthetic minority oversampling technique and a tree-based gap-filling method. Our model has an averaged out-of-bag cross-validation R-2 of 0.83 for different years, which is comparable to those of other studies, but improves its performance at high pollution levels and fills the gaps in missing AOD on daily scale. The full coverage and near real-time updates of the daily PM2.5 data allow us to track the day-to-day variations in PM2.5 concentrations over China in a timely manner. The long-term records of PM2.5 data since 2000 will also support policy assessments and health impact studies.

Therefore, the accurate prediction of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ?2.5 ?m) is very significant in the management of human health and the decision-making of government for the environmental management. In this study, a spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term (LSTM) memory (CNN-LSTM) model (also called PM (particulate matter) predictor) was proposed and used to predict the next day's daily average PM2.5 concentration in Beijing City. The spatiotemporal correlation analysis using the mutual information (MI) was performed, considering not only the linear correlation but also nonlinear correlation between target and observation parameters; in addition, it was fully considered for the whole area of China with the target monitoring station as the center and also for the historic air quality and meteorological data. As a result, the spatiotemporal feature vector (STFV) which reflects both linear and nonlinear correlations between parameters was effectively constructed. The PM predictor secured a fast and accurate prediction performance by efficiently extracting the inherent features of the latent air quality and meteorological input data associated with PM2.5 through CNN and by fully reflecting the long-term historic process of input time series data through LSTM. The air quality and meteorological data from the 384 monitoring stations which represents the whole area of China with Beijing City as the center during the 3 years (Jan. 1st, 2015 to Dec. 31th, 2017) were used to verify the validity of the proposed method.

In this paper, we propose an Aggregated LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model (ALSTM) based on the LSTM deep learning method. In this new model, we combine local air quality monitoring station, the station in nearby industrial areas, and the stations for external pollution sources. To improve prediction accuracy, we aggregate three LSTM models into a predictive model for early predictions based on external sources of pollution and information from nearby industrial air quality stations. We exploited the data with 17 attributes collected by Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency from 2012 to 2017 as the training data to build the ALSTM forecasting model, and we tested the model using the data collected in 2018.

The electricity load demand increases tremendously especially for a metropolitan city due to climatic conditions, population growth, local area development, industries expansion, air pollution, thermal device usage, etc. Hence, the accuracy of electricity load and its price forecasting is a deciding factor for the power distribution network to retain as an efficient, sustainable, and secure consumer-friendly network.

Today, the transportation sector is powered by burning the fossil-based fuels at more than 99% and approximately 6.5 million deaths annually occur due to air-pollution-related diseases worldwide. Therefore, knowledge of both energy demand and CO2 emission of a country is a very significant issue in order to revise its future energy investments and policies. In this framework, three machine learning algorithms (deep learning (DL), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN)) are used to forecast the transportation-based-CO2 emission and energy demand in Turkey. The gross domestic product per capita (GDP), population, vehicle kilometer, and year are used as input parameters in the study. It is noticed that there is a very high correlation among year, economic indicators, population, vehicle kilometer, transportation-based energy demand, and CO2 emissions. To present a better comparison, the results of these algorithms are discussed with six frequently used statistical metrics (R2, RMSE, MAPE, MBE, rRMSE, and MABE). For all machine learning algorithms, R2 values are varying between 0.8639 and 0.9235, and RMSE is smaller than 5 Ã 106 tons for CO2 emission and 2 Mtoe for energy demand. According to the classifications in the literature, the forecast results are generally categorized as ""excellent"" for rRMSE metric (&lt;10%), and Âhigh prediction accuracyÂ for MAPE metric (&lt;10%). On the other hand, with two mathematical models, future energy demand and CO2 emission arising from the transportation sector in Turkey are forecasted by the year 2050. In the results, it is forecasted that the annual growth rate for transportation-related energy demand and CO2 emission in Turkey cumulatively rise by 3.7% and 3.65%, respectively. Both energy demand and CO2 emissions from the transportation sector in Turkey will increase nearly 3.4 times higher in the year 2050 than those of today. In conclusion, the paper clearly reports that the future energy investments of the country should be revised, and various policies, regulations, norms, restrictions, legislations, and challenges on both energy consumption and emission mitigation from the transportation sector should be established by the policy-makers.

Many studies on haze already exist, which still need to continue in-depth research to better deal with haze problems.

Therefore, the research and prediction of smog pollution in Sichuan has become an urgent need. This paper proposes a deep learning technology based on a Deep Belief-Back Propagation neural network. It makes in-depth prediction research by using the air pollution data of PM2.5, PM10, O3, CO NO2, and SO2 in Sichuan smog to provide a decision-making basis for predicting and preventing smog polluted weather. According to the prediction results of the model, the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in Chengdu were predicted. The analysis shows that the larger the number of hidden layers in the belief network, the higher the prediction accuracy. Under the same network, the prediction accuracy of PM2.5 is significantly higher than that of PM10.

Indeed, there has been a significant increase in levels of environmental pollution in recent years. The aim of the work presented herein is to design an intelligent predictor for the concentrations of air pollutants over the next 2Â days based on deep learning techniques using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The best structure for its operation is then determined using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The new predictor based on intelligent computation relying on unsupervised learning, i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM) and optimization (i.e., PSO), is called the smart air quality prediction model (SAQPM). The main goal is to predict six the concentrations of six types of air pollution, viz. PM2.5 particulate matter, PM10, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). SAQPM consists of four stages. The first stage involves data collection from multiple stations (35 in this case). The second stage involves preprocessing of the data, including (a) separation of each station with an independent focus, (b) handle missing values, and (c) normalization of the dataset to the range of (0, 1) using the MinMaxScalar method. The third stage relates to building the predictor based on the LSTM method by identifying the best structure and parameter values (weight, bias, number of hidden layers, number of nodes in each hidden layer, and activation function) for the network using the functional PSO algorithm to achieve a goal. Thereafter, the dataset is split into training and testing parts based on the ten cross-validation principle. The training dataset is then used to build the predictor. In the fourth stage, evaluation results for each station are obtained by reading the concentration of each pollutant each hour for at most 30Â days then taking the average of the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) for 25Â days only.

In addition, over 40% of the environmental applications of ML go to air pollution, and its application range and acceptance in other aspects of environmental science remain to be increased. The use of ML methods to revolutionize environmental science and its problem-solving scenarios has its own challenges. Several issues should be taken into consideration, such as the tradeoff between model performance and interpretability, prerequisites of the machine learning model, model selection, and data sharing.",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,10.1021/acs.est.1c06157,70,35,No,,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess NO2 levels with high accuracy, we propose the use of an ensemble model to integrate multiple machine learning algorithms, including neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting, with a variety of predictor variables, including chemical transport models. This NO2 model covers the entire contiguous U.S. with daily predictions on 1-km-level grid cells from 2000 to 2016. The ensemble produced a cross-validated R2 of 0.788 overall, a spatial R2 of 0.844, and a temporal R2 of 0.729. The relationship between daily monitored and predicted NO2 is almost linear. We also estimated the associated monthly uncertainty level for the predictions and address-specific NO2 levels. This NO2 estimation has a very high spatiotemporal resolution and allows the examination of the health effects of NO2 in unmonitored areas. We found the highest NO2 levels along highways and in cities. We also observed that nationwide NO2 levels declined in early years and stagnated after 2007, in contrast to the trend at monitoring sites in urban areas, where the decline continued.

Furthermore, few methods are available to proactively identify potential risk areas for preventing soil contamination. In this study, we selected 13 environmental factors related to the accumulation of soil heavy metals based on the source-sink theory. Then, the fuzzy k-means method in combination with the random forest (RF) method was used to classify potential risk areas. The concentrations and spatial distributions of the heavy metals were well predicted by RF, and the average values of the root mean square error of the prediction and R2 were 4.84 mg kg?1 and 0.57, respectively. The results indicated that the soil pH, fine particulate matter, and proximity to polluting enterprises significantly influenced the heavy metal pollution in soils, and the environmental variables varied significantly across the identified subregions.

Whether PM2.5 alters brain structure and accelerates the preclinical neuropsychological processes remains unknown. Early decline of episodic memory is detectable in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study to examine whether PM2.5 affects the episodic memory decline, and also explored the potential mediating role of increased neuroanatomic risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with exposure. Participants included older females (n = 998; aged 73-87) enrolled in both the Women's Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging and the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, with annual (1999-2010) episodic memory assessment by the California Verbal Learning Test, including measures of immediate free recall/new learning (List A Trials 1-3; List B) and delayed free recall (shortand long-delay), and up to two brain scans (MRI-1: 2005-06; MRI-2: 2009-10). Subjects were assigned Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity scores (a brain-MRI measured neuroanatomical risk for Alzheimer's disease), developed by supervised machine learning and validated with data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Based on residential histories and environmental data on air monitoring and simulated atmospheric chemistry, we used a spatiotemporal model to estimate 3-year average PM2.5 exposure preceding MRI-1. In multilevel structural equation models, PM2.5 was associated with greater declines in immediate recall and new learning, but no association was found with decline in delayed-recall or composite scores. For each interquartile increment (2.81 ?g/m3) of PM2.5, the annual decline rate was significantly accelerated by 19.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9% to 36.2%] for Trials 1-3 and 14.8% (4.4% to 24.9%) for List B performance, adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity scores, which accounted for 22.6% (95% CI: 1% to 68.9%) and 10.7% (95% CI: 1.0% to 30.3%) of the total adverse PM2.5 effects on Trials 1-3 and List B, respectively. The observed associations remained after excluding incident cases of dementia and stroke during the follow-up, or further adjusting for small-vessel ischaemic disease volumes. Our findings illustrate the continuum of PM2.5 neurotoxicity that contributes to early decline of immediate free recall/new learning at the preclinical stage, which is mediated by progressive atrophy of grey matter indicative of increased Alzheimer's disease risk, independent of cerebrovascular damage.

This study proposed three new hybrid support vector machines (SVM) with particle swarm optimization algorithm (SVM-PSO), bat algorithm (SVM-BAT) and whale optimization algorithm (SVM-WOA) for predicting daily Rd in air-polluted regions. These models were further compared to standalone SVM, multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models. The results showed that models with suspended particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 ?m and 10 ?m (PM2.5 and PM10) and ozone (O3) produced more accurate daily Rd estimates than those without air pollution parameters, with average relative decreases in root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 11.1%, 10.0% and 10.4% for sunshine duration-based, Rs-based and combined models, respectively. SVM showed better accuracy than XGBoost and MARS. However, compared to SVM, SVM-BAT further enhanced the prediction accuracy and convergence rate in daily Rd modeling, followed by SVM-WOA and SVM-PSO, with relative decreases in RMSD of 2.9%Â5.6%, 1.9%Â4.9% and 1.1%Â3.3%, respectively. The results highlighted the significance of incorporating air pollutants for more accurate estimation of daily Rd in air-polluted regions.

Air quality prediction is to issue an alarm when severe pollution occurs, or pollution concentration exceeds a specific limit, contributing to the measure-taking of relevant departments, guiding urban socio-economic activities to promote sustainable urban development. However, existing methods have failed to make full use of the temporal features from spatiotemporal correlations of air quality monitoring stations, and achieved poor performances in long-term predictions (up to or above 24h-predictions). In this study, we proposed a deep learning framework to predict air quality in the following 24 h: a neural network with a temporal sliding long short-term memory extended model (TS-LSTME). The model integrated the optimal time lag to realize sliding prediction through multi-layer bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM), involving the hourly historical PM2.5 concentration, meteorological data, and temporal data. We applied the proposed model to predict the next 24 h average PM2.5 concentration in Jing-Jin-Ji region, with the most severe air pollution in China. The proposed model had better stability and performances with high correlation coefficient R2 (0.87), compared to the multiple linear regression (MLR), the support vector regression (SVR), the traditional LSTM, and the long short-term memory extended (LSTME) models. Moreover, the proposed model can achieve PM2.5 concentration predictions with high accuracy in long-term series (48 h and 72 h). We also tested the model to predict O3 concentration. The proposed model could be applied for other air pollutants. The proposed methods can significantly improve air quality prediction information services for the public and provide support for early warning and management of regional pollutants.

However, in-situ measurements of the ozone concentration before 2013 in China are quite scarce, which cannot facilitate the assessment of the long-term trends and effects of ozone pollution. In this study, we used daily maximum 8-hour average (MDA8) ozone observations from 2013 to 2017 combined with concurrent ozone retrievals, aerosol reanalysis, meteorological parameters, and land-use data to establish a nationwide MDA8 prediction model based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm.

External testing with regional measurements from 2005 to 2012 and nationwide data in 2018 have shown that the model is robust and reliable for historical data prediction, with external model testing R2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.87 at the month level in different years. Using the final estimator, we obtained nationwide monthly mean ozone concentrations from 2005 to 2012 and daily MDA8 ozone concentrations from 2013 to 2017 at a resolution of 0.1Â° Ã 0.1Â°. According to the average number of days exceeding the standard and the average of the 90th percentile of the MDA8 ozone concentrations, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Jianghan Plain, the Sichuan Basin, and the Northeast Plain regions were identified as pollution hotspots.

Earlier studies have used machine learning (ML) and statistical modeling to classify and forecast air pollution. However, these methods suffer from the complexity of air pollution dataset resulting in a lack of efficient classification and forecasting of air pollution.ML-based models suffer from improper data preprocessing, class imbalance issues, data splitting, and hyperparameter tuning. There is a gap in the existing ML-based studies on air pollution due to improper data handling and optimization. The present investigation aims to bridge these gaps and aid in effective air pollution classification and forecasting. Five ML models were developed, including one novel model named SMOTEDNN (SyntheticMinority Oversampling Technique with Deep Neural Network) to address air pollution classification. All five models utilized efficient data pre-processing and rigorous hyperparameter optimization. Three forecasting models were developed to forecast air pollution for one step-index based on statistical autoregression. All developed models in present investigation showed higher accuracy.

Smart congestion management allows road users to avoid congested areas, decreasing pollutant concentration. Accurately predicting congestion propagation is difficult however, due to the dynamic non-linear behavior of traffic flow. With the rise of Internet of Things devices, there are now data sets available that can be used to provide smart, sustainable transport solutions within cities. In this work, we introduce long short-term memory networks for the prediction of congestion propagation across a road network. Based on vehicle speed data from traffic sensors at two sites, our model predicts the propagation of congestion across a 5-min period within a busy town. Analysis of both univariate and multivariate predictive models show an accuracy of 84Â95% depending on the road layout. This accuracy shows that long short-term memory networks are suitable for predicting congestion propagation on road networks and may form a key component of future traffic modelling approaches for smart and sustainable cities around the world.

At the same time, being able to model, predict, and monitor air quality is becoming more and more relevant, especially in urban areas, due to the observed critical impact of air pollution on citizens' health and the environment. In this paper, we employ a popular machine learning method, support vector regression (SVR), to forecast pollutant and particulate levels and to predict the air quality index (AQI). Among the various tested alternatives, radial basis function (RBF) was the type of kernel that allowed SVR to obtain the most accurate predictions. Using the whole set of available variables revealed a more successful strategy than selecting features using principal component analysis. The presented results demonstrate that SVR with RBF kernel allows us to accurately predict hourly pollutant concentrations, like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ground-level ozone, and particulate matter 2.5, as well as the hourly AQI for the state of California.

The aggressive curtailing of the European economy had widespread impacts on the atmospheric composition, particularly for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3). To investigate these changes, we analyse data from 246 ambient air pollution monitoring sites in 102 urban areas and 34 countries in Europe between February and July 2020. Counterfactual, business-as-usual air quality time series are created using machine-learning models to account for natural weather variability. Across Europe, we estimate that NO2 concentrations were 34% and 32% lower than expected for respective traffic and urban background locations, whereas O-3 was 30% and 21% higher (in the same respective environments) at the point of maximum restriction on mobility. To put the 2020 changes into context, average NO2 trends since 2010 were calculated, and the changes experienced across European urban areas in 2020 was equivalent to 7.6 years of average NO2 reduction (or concentrations which might be anticipated in 2028).

First published in 2004 as Standard 62.1, ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2019 requires highly occupied spaces to implement heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) that can dilute contaminants produced by occupants. In this regard, occupant-centric ventilation control has been regarded as an effective practice to maintain a satisfactory indoor air quality (IAQ) when dealing with highly variable occupancy environments. However, few established models in current literature and practice consider dynamic occupancy behavior and adaptive IAQ control. To address this gap, a dynamic indoor CO2 model is constructed using machine learning algorithms to forecast CO2 concentrations across a range of forecasting horizons. Herein, we tuned and compared six state-of-the-art learning algorithmsÂincluding Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron. The algorithmsÂ performances are validated using CO2 and historical meteorological data collected from a campus classroom with a variable occupancy rate. Simulation results showed that Multilayer Perceptron can strongly predict the volatile CO2 behavior and also outperforms other algorithms in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, a control strategy capable of modeling and detecting dynamic patterns of CO2 level is utilized to modulate the ventilation rate in real-time and also reduce the energy consumption. The proposed controller reduced the HVAC fan's energy consumption by 51.4% and provided ventilation as needed per the ASHRAE standards.

The governments and scholars have spent lots of effort on controlling air pollution and mitigating its impacts on human society. Accurate prediction of air quality can provide essential decision-making supports, and therefore, scholars have proposed various kinds of models and methods for air quality forecastings, such as statistical methods, machine learning methods, and deep learning methods. Deep learning-based networks, such as RNN and LSTM, have been reported to achieve good performance in recent studies. However, the excellent performance of these methods requires sufficient data to train the model. For stations that lack data, such as newly built monitoring stations, the performance of those methods is constrained. Therefore, a methodology that could address the data shortage problem in new stations should be explored. This study proposes a transfer learning-based stacked bidirectional long short term memory (TLS-BLSTM) network to predict air quality for the new stations that lack data. The proposed method integrates advanced deep learning techniques and transfer learning strategies to transfer the knowledge learned from existing air quality stations to new stations to boost forecasting. A case study in Anhui, China, was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of TLS-BLSTM. The results show that the proposed method can help achieve 35.21% lower RMSE on average for the experimented three pollutants in new stations.

Currently, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are often run based on assumed occupancy levels and fixed schedules, or manually set by occupants based on their comfort needs. However, the unpredictability and variability of occupancy patterns can lead to over/under the conditioning of space when using such approaches, affecting indoor air quality and comfort. As a result, machine learning-based models and methodologies are progressively being used to forecast occupancy behaviour and routines in buildings, which may subsequently be used to aid in the design and operation of building systems. The present work reviews recent studies employing machine learning methods to predict occupancy behaviour and patterns, with a special focus on its related applications and benefits to building systems, improving energy efficiency, indoor air quality and thermal comfort. The review provides insight into the workflow of a machine learning-based occupancy prediction model, including data collection, prediction, and validation.

Here, we used the combination of a machine learning model, statistical method, and chemical transport model to quantify the meteorological impacts on PM2.5 pollution during 2000-2018. Specifically, we first developed a two-stage machine learning PM2.5 prediction model with a synthetic minority oversampling technique to improve the satellite-based PM2.5 estimates over highly polluted days, thus allowing us to better characterize the meteorological effects on haze events. Then we used two methods to examine the meteorological contribution to PM2.5: a generalized additive model (GAM) driven by the satellite-based full-coverage daily PM2.5 retrievals and the Weather Research and Forecasting/Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF/CMAQ) modeling system. We found good agreements between GAM estimations and the CMAQ model estimations of the meteorological contribution to PM2.5 on a monthly scale (correlation coefficient between 0.53-0.72). Both methods revealed the dominant role of emission changes in the long-term trend of PM2.5 concentration in China during 2000-2018, with notable influence from the meteorological condition. The interannual variabilities in meteorology-associated PM2.5 were dominated by the fall and winter meteorological conditions, when regional stagnant and stable conditions were more likely to happen and when haze events frequently occurred. From 2000 to 2018, the meteorological contribution became more unfavorable to PM2.5 pollution across the North China Plain and central China but were more beneficial to pollution control across the southern part, e.g., the Yangtze River Delta. The meteorology-adjusted PM2.5 over eastern China (denoted East China in figures) peaked in 2006 and 2011, mainly driven by the emission peaks in primary PM2.5 and gas precursors in these years. Although emissions dominated the long-term PM(2.5 )trends, the meteorology-driven anomalies also contributed -3.9 % to 2.8 % of the annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in eastern China estimated from the GAM. The meteorological contributions were even higher regionally, e.g., -6.3 % to 4.9 % of the annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, -5.1 % to 4.3 % in the Fenwei Plain, -4.8 % to 4.3 % in the Yangtze River Delta, and -25.6 % to 12.3 % in the Pearl River Delta.

Methods We obtained the texts of countries'annual statements in United Nations (UN) general debates from 2000 to 2019 and their nationally determined contributions at the Paris Agreement in 2016. To measure countries' engagement, we used a keyword-in-context text search with relevant search terms to count the total number of references to the relationship of health to climate change. We used a machine learning model (random forest predictions) to identify the most important country-level predictors of engagement. The predictors included political and economic factors, health outcomes, climate change-related variables and membership of political negotiating groups in the UN. Findings For both UN general debate statements and nationally determined contributions, low-and middle-income countries discussed the health impacts of climate change much more than did high-income countries. The most important predictors of engagement were health outcomes (infant mortality, maternal deaths, life expectancy), countries' income levels (gross domestic product per capita), and fossil fuel consumption. Membership of political negotiating groups (such as the Group of 77 and Small Island Developing States) was a less important predictor. Conclusion Our analysis indicated a higher engagement in countries that carry the heaviest climate-related health burdens, but lack necessary resources to address the impacts of climate change. These countries are shouldering responsibility for reminding the global community of the implications of climate change for people's health. Climate change is taking an increasing toll on people's health. The increase in heatwaves, drought, floods and other climate hazards is increasing the risk of climate-related illness and death as well as reversing gains made in reducing food insecurity and global hunger.1,2 Air pollution, primarily driven by fossil fuel emissions, is the major environmental risk factor for premature death and has impacts on child health and survival.3-5 Highlighting these human impacts is seen as a way of accelerating climate action,",BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,10.2471/blt.20.267112,76,26,No,,,,"England,Peoples R China,Belgium,Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reduce air pollution concentrations, and warn the public regarding the occurrence of hazardous air pollutants, an accurate and reliable air pollutant forecasting model must be designed. However, previous studies had numerous deficiencies, such as ignoring the importance of predictive stability and poor initial parameters; these deficiencies significantly affected the air pollution prediction performance. Therefore, in this study a novel hybrid model is proposed to address these issues. Powerful data preprocessing techniques are applied to decompose the original time series into different modes from low frequency to high frequency, and a new multi-objective Harris hawks optimization algorithm is developed to tune the parameters of the extreme learning machine (ELM) model with high forecasting accuracy and stability for prediction air pollution. The optimized ELM model is then used to predict a time-series of air pollution. Finally, a scientific and robust evaluation system with several error criteria, benchmark models, and experiments conducted using twelve air pollutant concentration time series from three cities in China is designed to assess the presented hybrid forecasting model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid model can achieve a more stable and higher predictive performance than other models, and its superior prediction ability may aid in developing effective plans for mitigating air pollutant emissions and preventing the health issues caused by air pollution.

Accordingly, it is very relevant predicting air quality. Although the application of the machine learning (ML) models for predicting air quality parameters, such as PM concentrations, has been evaluated in previous studies, those on the spatial hazard modeling of them are very limited. Due to the high potential of the ML models, the spatial modeling of PM can help managers to identify the pollution hotspots. Accordingly, this study aims at developing new ML models, such as Random Forest (RF), Bagged Classification and Regression Trees (Bagged CART), and Mixture Discriminate Analysis (MDA) for the hazard prediction of PM10 (particles with a diameter less than 10 Âµm) in the Barcelona Province, Spain. According to the annual PM10 concentration in 75 stations, the healthy and unhealthy locations are determined, and a ratio 70/30 (53/22 stations) is applied for calibrating and validating the ML models to predict the most hazardous areas for PM10. In order to identify the influential variables of PM modeling, the simulated annealing (SA) feature selection method is used. Seven features, among the thirteen features, are selected as critical features. According to the results, all the three-machine learning (ML) models achieve an excellent performance (Accuracy > 87% and precision > 86%). However, the Bagged CART and RF models have the same performance and higher than the MDA model.

This study exploits the use of the nextgeneration geostationary meteorological satellite Himawari-8/AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager) to document the diurnal variation in PM2.5.

The prediction model of DXN emission can be used for pollution control to realize actual requirements of operation optimization. Therefore, a DXN emission concentration prediction model based on improved deep forest regression (ImDFR) is proposed in this study. A feature reduction layer based on out-of-bagging error is first introduced into the ImDFR to eliminate redundant variables and feed all confidence information on DXN emission into the feature enhancement layer of the MSWI process. A deep ensemble stacking model is subsequently built to depict deep features and increase diversity and accuracy using random forests, completely random forests, GBDT, and XGBoost as subforests.

The DXN emission prediction model is verified using actual historical data of two incinerators operated with a daily processing capacity of 800 tons. The experimental results showed that the proposed prediction model presents higher accuracy and better generalization ability than state-of-the-art models.

Since Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are the major pollutants, various models have been developed on predicting their potential damages. Nevertheless, providing precise predictions is almost impossible. In this study, a new hybrid intelligent model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and multi-verse optimization algorithm (MVO) has been developed to predict and analysis the air pollution obtained from Combined Cycle Power Plants. In the proposed model, long short-term memory model is a forecaster engine to predict the amount of produced NO2 and SO2 by the Combined Cycle Power Plant, where the MVO algorithm is used to optimize the LSTM parameters in order to achieve a lower forecasting error. In addition, in order to evaluate the proposed model performance, the model has been applied using real data from a Combined Cycle Power Plant in Kerman, Iran. The datasets include wind speed, air temperature, NO2, and SO2 for five months (MayÂSeptember 2019) with a time step of 3-h. In addition, the model has been tested based on two different types of input parameters: type (1) includes wind speed, air temperature, and different lagged values of the output variables (NO2 and SO2); type (2) includes just lagged values of the output variables (NO2 and SO2). The obtained results show that the proposed model has higher accuracy than other combined forecasting benchmark models (ENN-PSO, ENN-MVO, and LSTM-PSO) considering different network input variables.

Formation of a particulate pollution event or haze episode (HE) involves many factors, including meteorology, emissions, and chemistry. Understanding the direct causes of and key drivers behind the HE is thus essential. Traditionally, this is done via chemical transport models. However, substantial uncertainties are introduced into the model estimation when there are significant changes in the emissions inventory due to interventions (e.g., the COVID-19 lockdown). Here we applied a Random Forest model coupled with a Shapley additive explanation algorithm, a post hoc explanation technique, to investigate the roles of major meteorological factors, primary emissions, and chemistry in five severe HEs that occurred before or during the COVID-19 lockdown in China. We discovered that, in addition to the high level of primary emissions, PM2.5 in these haze episodes was largely driven by meteorological effects (with average contributions of 30-65 mu g m(-3) for the five HEs), followed by chemistry (similar to 15-30 mu g m(-3)). Photochemistry was likely the major pathway of formation of nitrate, while air humidity was the predominant factor in forming sulfate.

Machine Learning (ML) methods in conjunction with spatiotemporal modeling can provide more flexible exposure-relevant metrics and have been studied using different model structures. There is however a lack of comparisons of methods available within these two modeling frameworks, that can guide model/algorithm selection in air quality epidemiology. Objective: The present study compares thirteen algorithms for spatial/spatiotemporal modeling applied for daily maxima of 8-hour running averages of ambient ozone concentrations at spatial resolutions corresponding to census tracts, to support estimation of annual ozone design values across the contiguous US. These algorithms were selected from nine representative categories and trained using predictors that included chemistry-transport model predictions, meteorological factors, land use and land cover, and stationary and mobile emissions. Methods: To obtain the best predictive performance, model structures were optimized through a repeated coarse/fine grid search with expert knowledge. Six target-oriented validation strategies were used to prevent overfitting and avoid over-optimistic model evaluation results. In order to take full advantage of the power of different algorithms, we introduced tuning sample weights in spatiotemporal modeling to ensure predictive accuracy of peak concentrations, that is crucial for exposure assessments. In spatial modeling, four interpretation and visualization tools were introduced to explain predictions from different algorithms. Results: Nonlinear ML methods achieved higher prediction accuracy than linear LUR, and the improvements were more significant for spatiotemporal modeling (nearly 10%-40% decrease of predicted RMSE). By tuning the sample weights, spatiotemporal models can predict concentrations used to calculate ozone design values that are comparable or even better than spatial models (nearly 30% decrease of cross-validated RMSE). We visualized the underlying nonlinear relationships, heterogeneous associations and complex interactions from the two best performing ML algorithms, i.e., Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting, and found that the complex patterns were relatively less significant with respect to model accuracy for spatial modeling. Conclusion: Machine Learning can provide estimates that are actually more interpretable and practical than linear regression to improve accuracy in modeling human exposures. A careful design of hyperparameter tuning and flexible data splitting and validations is crucial to obtain reliable and stable results. Desirable/successful nonlinear models are expected to capture similar nonlinear patterns and interactions using different ML algorithms.

In air quality assessment and epidemiological studies, peak concentrations can be important metrics. For instance, the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) use an ozone design value (DV), defined as the 3-year average of the annual 4th highest daily maximum 8-hour ozone concentration, to identify nonattainment areas with DV > 70 ppb (USEPA, 2018). Previous work has mostly focused on predicting annual averages of ambient air pollutant concentrations, and reported validation results were based on all samples, where low concentrations are dominant, while the prediction capability for peak concentrations cannot be guaranteed. Second, ML models are âblack-boxâ formulations and are considered to be less interpretable than the well-known linear regression models. It should be noted that it is not only important to construct models with higher prediction accuracy, but also to use the models to better explain the effects of different covariates on observed responses. Previous studies mainly used variable importance measures to improve the interpretability of ML models, while comprehensive studies for interpretable ML (Molnar, 2019) in air pollutant concentration estimation are rare.
 
 To fill the gaps discussed above, the present study implemented a comprehensive framework to compare thirteen ML algorithms for fine resolution estimation of ambient ozone concentrations. We developed spatiotemporal models to estimate Daily Maximum 8-Hour Average (DM8HA) ozone concentrations, and spatial models to estimate the annual 4th highest DM8HA (herein denoted as DVm) across the CONUS in 2011. For fair comparison, rigorous hyperparameter tuning and flexible targeted validations were conducted to maximize the performance of each algorithm. Sample weight tuning was designed to balance global accuracy and peak accuracy for spatiotemporal models, and various interpretation and visualization tools were applied to show that the so-called âblack-boxâ ML models can actually be âtransparentâ. The findings of this work can provide guidance on the selection of efficient modeling tools and algorithms for air pollution epidemiology and environmental health studies.","R2 and RMSE for training, cross validation, spatial, temporal, peak and external validation",Yes,Dimensionality reduction,NS,,NS,,NS,,NS,,NS,,"We also included latitude and longitude to capture spatial trends, and day of the year to capture temporal trends of ambient ozone concentrations."

In particular, the surface concentrations of air pollutants are closely related to human life. This study aims to develop models for estimating high spatial resolution surface concentrations of NO2 and O3 from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data in East Asia. The machine learning was adopted by fusion of various satellite-based variables, numerical model-based meteorological variables, and land-use variables. Four machine learning approachesÂSupport Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)Âwere evaluated and compared with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as a base statistical method. This study also modeled the NO2 and O3 concentrations over the ocean surface (i.e., land model for scheme 1 and ocean model for scheme 2). The estimated surface concentrations were validated through three cross-validation approaches (i.e., random, temporal, and spatial). The results showed that the NO2 model produced R2 of 0.63Â0.70 and normalized root-mean-square-error (nRMSE) of 38.3Â42.2% and the O3 model resulted in R2 of 0.65Â0.78 and nRMSE of 19.6Â24.7% for scheme 1. The indirect validation based on the stations near the coastline for scheme 2 showed slight decrease (~0.3Â2.4%) in nRMSE when compared to scheme 1. The contributions of input variables to the models were analyzed based on SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. The NO2 vertical column density among the TROPOMI-derived variables showed the largest contribution in both the NO2 and O3 models.

While some studies have explored the benefits of incorporating WMP in concrete mixtures, the lack of pertinent data and a comprehensive understanding of how WMP influences the engineering properties of concrete has hindered the large-scale applications of WMP in the concrete industry. Therefore, this study examines the capability of machine learning (ML) to model the compressive strength (CS) of concrete incorporating WMP since it is the most specified property of concrete. WMP can improve the performance of concrete mainly owing to a physical microfiller effect and providing preferential sites for the nucleation and growth of early-age cement hydration products. However, considering that the pozzolanic reactivity of WMP is insignificant as demonstrated by phase composition and thermogravimetric results, its incorporation rate in concrete mixtures should be limited to a specific dosage, which can be optimized using ML techniques. ML modelling results showed that the CS of WMP concrete could be predicted with high accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.97) using extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and artificial neural networks (ANN) informational models, with ANN being more sensitive to the content of WMP. The feature importance results, with multicollinearity consideration, showed that the role of WMP in strength development could be mainly limited to 10Â20% due to its inert nature.

Over the following days and weeks, strong reductions in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution were reported in many regions of Spain. A substantial part of these reductions was obviously due to decreased local and regional anthropogenic emissions. Yet, the confounding effect of meteorological variability hinders a reliable quantification of the lockdown's impact upon the observed pollution levels. Our study uses machine-learning (ML) models fed by meteorological data along with other time features to estimate the ""business-as-usual"" NO2 mixing ratios that would have been observed in the absence of the lockdown. We then quantify the so-called meteorology-normalized NO2 reductions induced by the lockdown measures by comparing the estimated business-as-usual values with the observed NO2 mixing ratios. We applied this analysis for a selection of urban background and traffic stations covering the more than 50 Spanish provinces and islands. The ML predictive models were found to perform remarkably well in most locations, with an overall bias, root mean square error and correlation of +4 %, 29% and 0.86, respectively. During the period of study, from the enforcement of the state of alarm in Spain on 14 March to 23 April, we found the lockdown measures to be responsible for a 50% reduction in NO2 levels on average over all provinces and islands. The lockdown in Spain has gone through several phases with different levels of severity with respect to mobility restrictions. As expected, the meteorology-normalized change in NO2 was found to be stronger during phase II (the most stringent phase) and phase III of the lockdown than during phase I. In the largest agglomerations, where both urban background and traffic stations were available, a stronger meteorology-normalized NO2 change is highlighted at traffic stations compared with urban background sites. Our results are consistent with foreseen (although still uncertain) changes in anthropogenic emissions induced by the lockdown. We also show the importance of taking the meteorological variability into account for accurately assessing the impact of the lockdown on NO2 levels, in particular at fine spatial and temporal scales. Meteorology-normalized estimates such as those presented here are crucial to reliably quantify the health implications of the lockdown due to reduced air pollution.",ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS,10.5194/acp-20-11119-2020,92,23,No,,,,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, their management and optimization are crucial for reducing their energy consumption and carbon footprint while maintaining an appropriate indoor environmental quality. This work is part of the SportE3.Q project, which aims to manage and optimize the operation of sports facilities. A neural network (NN)-based model predictive control (MPC) management and optimization system is proposed for the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system of a sports hall in the sports and events complex of Qatar University (QU). The proposed approach provides an integrated dynamic optimization method that accounts for future system behavior in the decision-making process, consisting of a prediction element and an optimizer. A NN is used to implement the dynamic prediction element of the MPC system and is compared with other machine learning (ML)-based models, which are support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and decision trees (DT). The NN-based model outperforms the other ML models with an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of around 0.06 between the actual and the predicted values, and an average R of 0.99 as NNs are popular for their high accuracy and reliability. Two schemes of the proposed NN-based MPC system are investigated for managing and optimizing the operation of the hall's HVAC system for enhanced energy use and indoor environment quality, as well as for providing occupancy profile recommendations to aid the facilitiesÂ managers in handling their operation.

Using satellite-driven models to generate spatiotemporally resolved PM2.5levels, we aimed to estimate high-resolution, long-term PM2.5and associated mortality burden in China. The multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 1-km resolution was employed as a primary predictor to estimate PM2.5concentrations. Imputation techniques were adopted to fill in the missing AOD retrievals and provide accurate long-term AOD aggregations. Monthly PM2.5concentrations in China from 2000 to 2016 were estimated using machine-learning approaches and used to analyze spatiotemporal trends of adult mortality attributable to PM2.5exposure. Mean coverage of AOD increased from 56 to 100% over the 17-y period, with the accuracy of long-termaverages enhanced after gap filling.Machine-learning models performed well with a random cross-validation R2 of 0.93 at the monthly level. For the time period outside the model training window, prediction R2 values were estimated to be 0.67 and 0.80 at the monthly and annual levels. Across the adult population in China, long-term PM2.5exposures accounted for a total number of 30.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28.6, 33.2) million premature deaths over the 17-y period, with an annual burden ranging from 1.5 (95% CI: 1.3, 1.6) to 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.4) million.

Modelling methods based on having access to a limited number of monitor stations are required for capturing PM2.5 spatial and temporal continuous variations with a sufficient resolution. This study utilized a land use regression (LUR) model with machine learning to assess the spatial-temporal variability of PM2.5. Daily average PM2.5 data was collected from 73 fixed air quality monitoring stations that belonged to the Taiwan EPA on the main island of Taiwan. Nearly 280,000 observations from 2006 to 2016 were used for the analysis. Several datasets were collected to determine spatial predictor variables, including the EPA environmental resources dataset, a meteorological dataset, a land-use inventory, a landmark dataset, a digital road network map, a digital terrain model, MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) database, and a power plant distribution dataset. First, conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR were utilized to identify the important predictor variables. Then, deep neural network, random forest, and XGBoost algorithms were used to fit the prediction model based on the variables selected by the LUR models. Data splitting, 10-fold cross validation, external data verification, and seasonal-based and county-based validation methods were used to verify the robustness of the developed models. The results demonstrated that the proposed conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR models captured 58% and 89% of PM2.5 variations, respectively. When XGBoost algorithm was incorporated, the explanatory power of the models increased to 73% and 94%, respectively. The Hybrid Kriging-LUR with XGBoost algorithm outperformed the other integrated methods.

The severe level of PM2.5 directly affects the public health, economics and social development. Due to the strong nonlinearity and instability of the air quality, it is difficult to predict the volatile changes of PM2.5 over time. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model VMD-BiLSTM is constructed, which combines variational mode decomposition (VMD) and bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM), to predict PM2.5 changes in cities in China. VMD decomposes the original PM2.5 complex time series data into multiple sub-signal components according to the frequency domain. Then, BiLSTM is employed to predict each sub-signal component separately, which significantly improved forecasting accuracy. Through a comprehensive study with existing models, such as the EMD-based models and other VMD-based models, we justify the outperformance of the proposed VMD-BiLSTM model over all compared models. The results show that the prediction results are significantly improved with the proposed forecasting framework. And the prediction models integrating VMD are better than those integrating EMD. Among all the models integrating VMD, the proposed VMD-BiLSTM model is the most stable forecasting method.

We have evaluated the model for 21 continuous ambient monitoring stations (CAMS) across Texas. The inputs for the CNN model consist of meteorology (e.g., wind field, temperature) and air pollution concentrations (NO x and ozone) from the previous day. The model is trained for predicting next-day, 24-hour ozone concentrations. We acquired meteorological and air pollution data from 2014 to 2017 from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). For 19 of the 21 stations in the study, results show that the yearly index of agreement (IOA) is above 0.85, confirming the acceptable accuracy of the CNN model. The results also show the model performed well, even for stations with varying monthly trends of ozone concentrations (specifically CAMS-012, located in El-Paso, and CAMS-013, located in Fort Worth, both with IOA=0.89). In addition, to ensure that the model was robust, we tested it on stations where fewer meteorological variables are monitored. Although these stations have fewer input features, their performance is similar to that of other stations. However, despite its success at capturing daily trends, the model mostly underpredicts the daily maximum ozone, which provides a direction for future study and improvement. As this model predicts ozone concentrations 24 h in advance with greater accuracy and computationally fewer resources, it can serve as an early warning system for individuals susceptible to ozone and those engaging in outdoor activities.

However, existing methods for PM2.5 concentration prediction neglect the effects of featured states at different times in the past on future PM2.5 concentration, and most fail to effectively simulate the temporal and spatial dependencies of PM2.5 concentration at the same time. With this consideration, we propose a deep learning-based method, AC-LSTM, which comprises a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and attention-based network, for urban PM2.5 concentration prediction. Instead of only using air pollutant concentrations, we also add meteorological data and the PM2.5 concentrations of adjacent air quality monitoring stations as the input to our AC-LSTM. Hence, the spatiotemporal correlation and interdependence of multivariate air quality-related time-series data are learned by the CNN-LSTM network in AC-LSTM. The attention mechanism is applied to capture the importance degrees of the effects of featured states at different times in the past on future PM2.5 concentration. The attention-based layer can automatically weigh the past feature states to improve prediction accuracy. In addition, we predict the PM2.5 concentrations over the next 24 h by using air quality data in Taiyuan city, China, and compare it with six baseline methods. To compare the overall performance of each method, the mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and coecient of determination (R2) are applied to the experiments in this paper.

These restrictions had positive impacts for air quality due to a dramatic reduction of economic activity and atmospheric emissions. In this work, a machine learning approach was designed and implemented to analyze local air quality improvements during the COVID-19 lockdown in Graz, Austria. The machine learning approach was used as a robust alternative to simple, historical measurement comparisons for various individual pollutants. Concentrations of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), PM10 (particulate matter), O3 (ozone) and Ox (total oxidant) were selected from five measurement sites in Graz and were set as target variables for random forest regression models to predict their expected values during the city's lockdown period. The true vs. expected difference is presented here as an indicator of true pollution during the lockdown. The machine learning models showed a high level of generalization for predicting the concentrations. Therefore, the approach was suitable for analyzing reductions in pollution concentrations. The analysis indicated that the city's average concentration reductions for the lockdown period were: -36.9 to ?41.6%, and ?6.6 to ?14.2% for NO2 and PM10, respectively. However, an increase of 11.6Â33.8% for O3 was estimated. The reduction in pollutant concentration, especially NO2 can be explained by significant drops in traffic-flows during the lockdown period (?51.6 to ?43.9%). The results presented give a real-world example of what pollutant concentration reductions can be achieved by reducing traffic-flows and other economic activities.

Although urbanization leads to great social and economic progress, they may be confronted with other issues, including extra heat and air pollution. Local climate zone (LCZ), a new concept developed for urban heat island research, provides a standard classification system for the urban environment. LCZs are defined by the context of the urban environment; the minimum diameter of an LCZ is expected to be 400Â1,000 m so that it can have a valid effect on the urban climate. However, most existing methods (e.g., the WUDAPT method) regard this task as pixel-based classification, neglecting the spatial information. In this study, we argue that LCZ mapping should be considered as a scene classification task to fully exploit the environmental context. Fifteen cities covering 138 million population in three economic regions of China are selected as the study area. Sentinel-2 multispectral data with a 10 m spatial resolution are used to classify LCZs. A deep convolutional neural network composed of residual learning and the Squeeze-and-Excitation block, namely the LCZNet, is proposed. We obtained an overall accuracy of 88.61% by using a large image (48Ã48 corresponding to 480Ã480 m2) as the representation of an LCZ, 7.5% higher than that using a small image representation (10Ã10) and nearly 20% higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Image sizes from 32Ã32 to 64Ã64 were found suitable for LCZ mapping, while a deeper network achieved better classification with larger inputs. Compared with natural classes, urban classes benefited more from a large input size, as it can exploit the environment context of urban areas. The combined use of the training data from all three regions led to the best classification, but the transfer of LCZ models cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the domain shift. More advanced domain adaptation methods should be applied in this application. Â© 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Existing methods have gone through the development from deterministic methods, statistical methods, to machine learning and deep learning methods. The latest direction lies in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based methods. They are a special kind of deep learning network, and can not only well model non-linear real-world problems, but also consider the impact of long-historical values. These methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in air quality predictions, but some gaps have not been well addressed, especially the overlook on the multi-sequential-variants, and the lack of efficient parameter optimization in the deep learning models. To this end, this study proposes a Lag-FLSTM (Lag layer-LSTM-Fully Connected network) model based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) for multivariant air quality prediction. A case study in the U.S. is conducted to test the method. The results showed that Lag-FLSTM has at least 23.86 % lower RMSE than other methods. The contributions of this study are that we not only developed a deep learning method that can automatically optimize the model parameters but also studied how different metrological features and other pollutants affect the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations.

A number of previous studies have explored the relationships between air pollution and related factors. However, the methods currently used either cannot well address the multicollinearity problem or fail to explain the importance of the influential factors. Moreover, most of the existing literature limited their studied area in a city or a small region and studied factors in one aspect. There is a lack of studies that analyze the influential factors from the perspective of a country or take into consideration multiple variables. To fill the research gap, this paper proposes a multivariate analysis in the national scale to investigate the most important factors of air quality. In order to study as much influential factors as possible, 171 features ranging from environmental, demographical, economic, meteorological, and energy, were collected and analyzed. To tackle such a ""big data"" problem, a non-linear machine learning algorithm namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is utilized to model the relationship and measure the variable importance. Geographical Information System (GIS) is employed to preprocess the diversified variables and visualize the results. Performance of XGBoost is compared with other models and its parameters are tuned using Bayesian Optimization. Experimental results of a case study in the U.S. show that our methodology framework can effectively uncover the important factors of air quality. Six kinds of factors are found to have the largest impact on air quality. Practical suggestions are also proposed from the six aspects to control and prevent air pollution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To lessen potential fire threats, it is helpful to recognize fire occurrence patterns and identify fire susceptibility in wildfire-prone regions. The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms is acknowledged as one of the most well-known methods for addressing non-linear issues like wildfire hazards. It has always been difficult to analyze these multivariate environmental disasters because modeling can be influenced by a variety of sources of uncertainty, including the quantity and quality of training procedures and input variables. Moreover, although ML techniques show promise in this field, they are unstable for a number of reasons, including the usage of irrelevant descriptor characteristics when developing the models. Explainable AI (XAI) can assist us in acquiring insights into these constraints and, consequently, modifying the modeling approach and training data necessary. In this research, we describe how a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) model can be utilized to interpret the results of a deep learning (DL) model that is developed for wildfire susceptibility prediction. Different contributing factors such as topographical, landcover/vegetation, and meteorological factors are fed into the model and various SHAP plots are used to identify which parameters are impacting the prediction model, their relative importance, and the reasoning behind specific decisions. The findings drawn from SHAP plots show the significant contributions made by factors such as humidity, wind speed, rainfall, elevation, slope, and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) to the suggested model's output for wildfire susceptibility mapping. We infer that developing an explainable model would aid in comprehending the model's decision to map wildfire susceptibility, pinpoint high-contributing components in the prediction model, and consequently control fire hazards effectively. © 2023 The Authors",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163004,19,19,No,,,,"Australia,Malaysia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, combined with the large volume of real-time monitoring data, we propose a deep learning model, iDeepAir, to predict surface-level PM2.5 concentration in Shanghai megacity and link with MEIC emission inventory creatively to decipher urban traffic impacts on air quality. Our model exhibits high-fidelity in reproducing pollutant concentrations and reduces the MAE from 25.355 μg/m3 to 12.283 μg/m3 compared with other models. And identifies the ranking of major factors, local meteorological conditions have become a nonnegligible factor. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is used here to enhance the interpretability of the model and we visualize and analyze the reasons for the different correlation between traffic density and PM2.5 concentration in various regions of Shanghai. Meanwhile, As the strict and effective industrial emission reduction measurements implementing in China, the contribution of urban traffic to PM2.5 formation calculated by combining MEIC emission inventory and LRP is gradually increasing from 18.03% in 2011 to 24.37% in 2017 in Shanghai, and the impact of traffic emissions would be ever-prominent in 2030 according to our prediction. We also infer that the promotion of vehicular electrification would achieve further alleviation of PM2.5 about 8.45% by 2030 gradually. These insights are of great significance to provide the decision-making basis for accurate and high-efficient traffic management and urban pollution control, and eventually benefit people's lives and high-quality sustainable developments of cities. © 2022",Journal of Environmental Sciences (China),10.1016/j.jes.2021.12.035,19,19,Yes,CNN,,Yes,China,Contribution of traffic emmisions to PM2.5,PM2.5,,,,,,"Traffic data	TSI	28.39	9.13	5.83	50.64	2 min

We aimed to use machine learning methods to systematically synthesise an evidence base on climate change and human health. Methods: We used supervised machine learning and other natural language processing methods (topic modelling and geoparsing) to systematically identify and map the scientific literature on climate change and health published between Jan 1, 2013, and April 9, 2020. Only literature indexed in English were included. We searched Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and PubMed using title, abstract, and keywords only. We searched for papers including both a health component and an explicit mention of either climate change, climate variability, or climate change-relevant weather phenomena. We classified relevant publications according to the fields of climate research, climate drivers, health impact, date, and geography. We used supervised and unsupervised machine learning to identify and classify relevant articles in the field of climate and health, with outputs including evidence heat maps, geographical maps, and narrative synthesis of trends in climate health-related publications. We included empirical literature of any study design that reported on health pathways associated with climate impacts, mitigation, or adaptation. Findings: We predict that there are 15 963 studies in the field of climate and health published between 2013 and 2019. Climate health literature is dominated by impact studies, with mitigation and adaptation responses and their co-benefits and co-risks remaining niche topics. Air quality and heat stress are the most frequently studied exposures, with all-cause mortality and infectious disease incidence being the most frequently studied health outcomes. Seasonality, extreme weather events, heat, and weather variability are the most frequently studied climate-related hazards. We found major gaps in evidence on climate health research for mental health, undernutrition, and maternal and child health. Geographically, the evidence base is dominated by studies from high-income countries and China, with scant evidence from low-income counties, which often suffer most from the health consequences of climate change. Interpretation: Our findings show the importance and feasibility of using automated machine learning to comprehensively map the science on climate change and human health in the age of big literature. These can provide key inputs into global climate and health assessments. The scant evidence on climate change response options is concerning and could significantly hamper the design of evidence-based pathways to reduce the effects on health of climate change. In the post-2015 Paris Agreement era of climate solutions, we believe much more attention should be given to climate adaptation and mitigation options and their effects on human health.

This paper presents a novel bidirectional long short-Term memory LSTM network based parallel reinforcement learning PRL approach to construct EMS for a hybrid tracked vehicle HTV . This method contains two levels. The high-level establishes a parallel system first, which includes a real powertrain system and an artificial system. Then, the synthesized data from this parallel system is trained by a bidirectional LSTM network. The lower-level determines the optimal EMS using the trained action state function in the model-free reinforcement learning RL framework. PRL is a fully data-driven and learning-enabled approach that does not depend on any prediction and predefined rules. Finally, real vehicle testing is implemented and relevant experiment data is collected and calibrated. Experimental results validate that the proposed EMS can achieve considerable energy efficiency improvement by comparing with the conventional RL approach and deep RL.

Remote monitoring PM2.5 using satellite-based data would be incredibly advantageous to this effort, but current machine learning methods lack necessary interpretability and predictive accuracy. This study details the development of a new Spatial-Temporal Interpretable Deep Learning Model (SIDLM) to improve the interpretability and predictive accuracy of satellite-based PM2.5 measurements. In contrast to traditional deep learning models, the SIDLM is both ÂwideÂ and Âdeep.Â We comprehensively evaluated the proposed model in China using different input data (top-of-atmosphere (TOA) measurements-based and aerosol optical depth (AOD)-based, with or without meteorological data) and different spatial resolutions (10 km, 3 km, and 250 m). TOA-based SIDLM PM2.5 achieved the best predictive accuracy in China, with root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 15.30 and 15.96 ?g/m3, and R2 values of 0.70 and 0.66 for PM2.5 predictions at 10 km and 3 km spatial resolutions, respectively. Additionally, we tested the SIDLM in PM2.5 retrievals at a 250 m spatial resolution over Beijing, China (RMSE = 16.01 ?g/m3, R2 = 0.62). Furthermore, SIDLM demonstrated higher accuracy than five machine learning inversion methods, and also outperformed them regarding feature extraction and the interpretability of its inversion results. In particular, modeling results indicated the strong influence of the Tongzhou district on the principle PM2.5 in the Beijing urban area. SIDLM-extracted temporal characteristics revealed that summer months (JuneÂAugust) might have contributed less to PM2.5 concentrations, indicating the limited accumulation of PM2.5 in these months. Our study shows that SIDLM could become an important tool for other earth observation data in deep learning-based predictions and spatiotemporal analysis.

The three ten-folded cross-validations (CV) methods including sample-based, time-based, and spatial-based validation combined with Coefficient Square (R2), Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Predictive Error (MPE) have been used for validation at different temporal scales in terms of daily, monthly, heating seasonal, and non-heating seasonal. Finally, the distribution map of PM2.5 concentrations was illustrated based on the RF model. Some findings were achieved. The RF model performed well, with a relatively high sample-based cross-validation R2 of 0.74, a low RMSE of 16.29 ?g Ã m?3, and a small MPE of ?0.282 ?g Ã m?3. Meanwhile, the performance of the RF model in inferring the PM2.5 concentrations was well at urban scales except for Chengyu (CY).

The robustness of the RF model in the present study outperformed most statistical regression models for calibrating PM2.5 concentrations.

The national models with high spatiotemporal resolutions to predict ground ozone concentrations are limited in China so far. In this study, we aimed to develop a random forest model by combining ground ozone measurements from fixed stations, ozone simulations from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system, meteorological parameters, population density, road length, and elevation to predict ground maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) ozone concentrations at a daily level and 1 km Ã 1 km spatial resolution. The model cross-validation R2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) were 0.80 and 20.93 ?g/m3 at daily level in 2013Â2019, respectively. CMAQ ozone simulations and near-surface temperature played vital roles in predicting ozone concentrations among all predictors. The population-weighted median concentrations of predicted MDA8 ozone were 89.34 ?g/m3 in mainland China in 2013, and reached 100.96 ?g/m3 in 2019. However, the long-term temporal variations among regions were heterogeneous. Central and Eastern China, as well as the Southeast Coastal Area, suffered higher ozone pollution and higher increased rates of ozone concentrations from 2013 to 2019. The seasonal pattern of ozone pollution varied spatially. The peak-season ozone pollution with the highest 6-month ozone concentrations occurred in different months among regions, with more than half domain in AprilÂSeptember. The predictions showed that not only the annual mean concentrations but also the percentages of grid-days with MDA8 ozone concentrations higher than 100/160 ?g/m3 have been increasing in the past few years in China; meanwhile, majority areas in mainland China suffered peak-season ozone concentrations higher than the air quality guidelines launched by the World Health Organization in September 2021. The proposed model and ozone predictions with high spatiotemporal resolution and full coverage could provide health studies with flexible choices to evaluate ozone exposure levels at multiple spatiotemporal scales in the future.

Monitoring and predicting air quality have become essentially important in this era, especially in developing countries like India. In contrast to the traditional methods, the prediction technologies based on machine learning techniques are proved to be the most efficient tools to study such modern hazards. The present work investigates six years of air pollution data from 23 Indian cities for air quality analysis and prediction. The dataset is well preprocessed and key features are selected through the correlation analysis. An exploratory data analysis is exercised to develop insights into various hidden patterns in the dataset and pollutants directly affecting the air quality index are identified. A significant fall in almost all pollutants is observed in the pandemic year, 2020. The data imbalance problem is solved with a resampling technique and five machine learning models are employed to predict air quality. The results of these models are compared with the standard metrics. The Gaussian Naive Bayes model achieves the highest accuracy while the Support Vector Machine model exhibits the lowest accuracy. The performances of these models are evaluated and compared through established performance parameters.

Modeling of the complex relationships between these variables by sophisticated methods in machine learning is a promising field. The objectives of this work are to develop a supervised model for the prediction of air pollution by using real sensor data and to transfer the model between cities. The combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory deep neural network model was proposed to predict the concentration of air pollutants in multiple locations of a city by using spatial-temporal relationships. Two approaches have been adopted: the univariate model contains the information of one pollutant whereas the multivariate model contains the information of all pollutants and meteorology data for prediction. The study was carried out for different pollutants which are in the publicly available data of the cities of Barcelona, Kocaeli, and ?stanbul. The hyperparameters of the model (filter, frame, and batch sizes; number of convolutional/LSTM layers and hidden units; learning rate; and parameters for sample selection, pooling, and validation) were tuned to determine the architecture that achieved the lowest test error. The proposed model improved the prediction performance (measured by the root mean square error) by 11Â53% for particulate matter, 20Â31% for ozone, 9Â47% for nitrogenoxides, and 18Â46% for sulfurdioxide with respect to the 1-hidden layer long short-term memory networks utilized in the literature. The multivariate model without using meteorological data revealed the best results. Regarding transfer learning, the network weights were transferred from the source city to the target city. The model has more accurate prediction performance with the transfer of the network from Kocaeli to ?stanbul as those neighbor cities have similar air pollution and meteorological characteristics.

Air pollution is the reason behind degraded indoor air quality (IAQ) in urban buildings. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main contributor to indoor pollution as humans themselves are one of the generating sources of this pollutant. The testing and monitoring of CO2 consume cost and time and require smart sensors. Thus, to solve these limitations, machine learning (ML) has been used to predict the concentration of CO2 inside an office room. This study is based on the data collected through real-time measurements of indoor CO2, number of occupants, area per person, outdoor temperature, outer wind speed, relative humidity, and air quality index used as input parameters. In this study, ten algorithms, namely, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), Gaussian process regression (GPR), linear regression (LR), ensemble learning (EL), optimized GPR, optimized EL, optimized DT, and optimized SVM, were used to predict the concentration of CO2. It has been found that the optimized GPR model performs better than other selected models in terms of prediction accuracy. The result of this study indicated that the optimized GPR model can predict the concentration of CO2 with the highest prediction accuracy having R, RMSE, MAE, NS, and a20-index values of 0.98874, 4.20068 ppm, 3.35098 ppm, 0.9817, and 1, respectively. This study can be utilized by the designers, researchers, healthcare professionals, and smart city developers to analyse the indoor air quality for designing air ventilation systems and monitoring CO2 level inside the buildings.

Here we present soil Hg concentrations from the LUCAS topsoil (0Â20 cm) survey including 21,591 samples from 26 European Union countries (one sample every ~200 km2). Deep Neural Network (DNN) learning models were used to map the European soil Hg distribution. DNN estimated a median Hg concentration of 38.3 ?g kg?1 (2.6 to 84.7 ?g kg?1) excluding contaminated sites. At continental scale, we found that soil Hg concentrations increased with latitude from south to north and with altitude. A GLMM revealed a correlation (R2 = 0.35) of soil Hg concentrations with vegetation activity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and soil organic carbon content. This observation corroborates the importance of atmospheric Hg0 uptake by plants and the build-up of the soil Hg pool by litterfall over continental scales. The correlation of Hg concentrations with NDVI was amplified by higher soil organic matter content, known to stabilize Hg in soils through thiol bonds. We find a statistically significant relation between soil Hg levels and coal use in large power plants, proving that emissions from power plants are associated with higher mercury deposition in their proximity. In total 209 hotspots were identified, defined as the top percentile in Hg concentration (&gt;422 ?g kg?1). 87 sites (42% of all hotspots) were associated with known mining areas. The sources of the other hotspots could not be identified and may relate to unmined geogenic Hg or industrial pollution. The mapping effort in the framework of LUCAS can serve as a starting point to guide local and regional authorities in identifying Hg contamination hotspots in soils.

Accordingly, accurate prediction for PM2.5 plays a vital role in taking precautions against upcoming air ambient pollution incidents. However, due to the disturbance of seasonal and nonlinear characteristics in the raw series, pronounced forecasts are confronted with tremendous handicaps, even though for seasonal grey prediction models in the preceding researches. A novel seasonal nonlinear grey model is initially designed to address such issues by integrating the seasonal adjustment factor, the conventional Weibull Bernoulli grey model, and the cultural algorithm, simultaneously depicting the seasonality and nonlinearity of the original data. Experimental results from PM2.5 forecasting of four major cities (Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Hefei) in the YRD validate that the proposed model can obtain more accurate predictive results and stronger robustness, in comparison with grey prediction models (SNGBM(1,1) and SGM(1,1)), conventional econometric technology (SARIMA), and machine learning methods (LSSVM and BPNN) by employing accuracy levels.

GEOS-CF expands on the GEOS weather and aerosol modeling system by introducing the GEOS-Chem chemistry module to provide hindcasts and 5-days forecasts of atmospheric constituents including ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The chemistry module integrated in GEOS-CF is identical to the offline GEOS-Chem model and readily benefits from the innovations provided by the GEOS-Chem community. Evaluation of GEOS-CF against satellite, ozonesonde and surface observations for years 2018Â2019 show realistic simulated concentrations of O3, NO2, and CO, with normalized mean biases of ?0.1 to 0.3, normalized root mean square errors between 0.1Â0.4, and correlations between 0.3Â0.8. Comparisons against surface observations highlight the successful representation of air pollutants in many regions of the world and during all seasons, yetÂ also highlight current limitations, such as a global high bias in SO2 and an overprediction of summertime O3 over the Southeast United States. GEOS-CF v1.0 generally overestimates aerosols by 20%Â50% due to known issues in GEOS-Chem v12.0.1 that have been addressed in later versions.

Data-driven approaches are particularly interesting but the stochastic nature of wind renders prediction tasks difficult. Therefore, a combination of methods could be useful to obtain better results. To overcome this difficulty, a hybrid wind speed forecasting approach is proposed in this work. The Bay of Algeciras, Spain, was used as a case study, and the database was collected from a weather monitoring station. The study consists of combining a pre-processing method, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), an information-based method, the permutation entropy (PE), and a machine learning technique (artificial neural networks, ANNs), using an ensemble learning methodology. Different prediction horizons were considered: ph-hours (ph = 1, 2, 8, 24) ahead and 8-h and 24-h average. The introduction of PE significantly reduces the computational cost and the predictive risk in comparison with traditional EMD methodology, by reducing the number of the decomposed components to be predicted. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrated that the EMDÂPEÂANN approach outperforms the prediction performance of the single ANN models in all the prediction horizons tested. The EMDÂPEÂANN model is capable to achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.981 and 0.807 for short-term (1Â h) and medium-term (24Â h) predictions, respectively, significantly overcoming those obtained by a single ANN model (0.929 and 0.503). These results show that the proposed model reaches significant improvements when the prediction horizon increases, where forecasting models tend to worsen their prediction performance. Therefore, the proposed EMDÂPEÂANN approach may become a powerful tool for wind speed forecasting.

In addition to alert the public for health concerns, accurate ozone prediction is also crucial to understand the formation mechanisms of surface ozone episodes, and has significant implications for making emission control strategies of ozone precursors such as methane, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds. However, existing methods of ozone concentration prediction could not effectively capture temporal dependency, and most neglect spatial correlations. In this study, a hybrid sequence to sequence model embedded with the attention mechanism is proposed for predicting regional ground-level ozone concentration. In the proposed model, the inherent spatiotemporal correlations in air quality monitoring network are simultaneously extracted, learned and incorporated, and auxiliary air pollution and meteorological information are adaptively involved. The hourly data collected from 35 air quality monitoring stations and 651 meteorological girds in Beijing, China are used to validate the present model. The results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal correlations in the monitoring network present enormous advantages for the regional ozone prediction. Auxiliary data and time lags matching day-of-week or diurnal periods of ozone are confirmed to benefit the improvement of prediction accuracy. Monitoring stations in urban areas exhibit better prediction performances than stations in remote areas. The addressed model outperforms the baseline models, and is proven to have excellent performance in all monitoring station categories of Beijing and different months with significant disparity of ozone concentrations.

However, studies assessing gestational windows of susceptibility have been mostly lim-ited by trimesters. OBJECTIVE: We identified sensitive windows of exposure to regional air pollution and risk of ASD and examined sex differences in a large birth cohort. METHODS: This population-based retrospective cohort study included 294,937 motherÂchild pairs with singleton deliveries in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) hospitals from 2001 to 2014. Children were followed using electronic medical records until clinical ASD diagnosis, non-KPSC membership, death, or 31 December 2019, whichever came first. Weekly mean fine particulate matter [PM with an aerodynamic diameter of ?2:5 lm (PM2:5)], nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) pregnancy exposures were estimated using spatiotemporal prediction models. Cox propor-tional hazard models with distributed lags were used to estimate weekly pollutant exposure associations with ASD risk for the entire cohort, and sepa-rately for boys and for girls. Models were adjusted for child sex (for full cohort), maternal race/ethnicity, maternal age at delivery, parity, maternal education, maternal comorbidities, medical center, census tract median household income, birth year, and season. RESULTS: There were 5,694 ASD diagnoses (4,636 boys, 1,058 girls). Sensitive PM2:5 exposure windows associated with ASD were found early in pregnancy, statistically significant throughout the first two trimesters [1Â27 wk of gestation, cumulative hazard ratio Ã°HRÃ = 1:14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.23] per interquartile range (IQR) (7:4-lg=m3) increase]. O3 exposure during 34Â37 wk of gestation was associated with increased risk [HR = 1:06 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.11) per IQR (17:4 ppb) increase] but with reduced risk during 20Â28 wk of gestation [HR = 0:93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.98)]. No associations were observed with NO2. Sex-stratified early gestational PM2:5 associations were stronger among boys [boys HR = 1:16 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.26); girls HR = 1:06 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.26)]. O3 associations in later gestation were observed only in boys [boys HR = 1:10 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.16); girls HR = 0:94 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.05)]. CONCLUSIONS: Exposures to PM2:5 in the first two gestational trimesters were associated with increased ASD risk in children, with stronger associations observed for boys. The role of O3 exposure on ASD risk merits further investigation. Â© 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

To dynamically monitor fine particulate matter over large geographic areas, some machine learning methods have been utilized to estimate its concentration using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD). To improve the estimation of PM2.5 concentration across large areas, a geospatial-temporal joint code is proposed in this paper to characterize the influence of spatial-temporal information hidden in satellite-based aerosol products. This encoding method can reveal the relationship between the PM2.5 concentration and its geospatial location and observation time. Instead of aggregating observation data over neighbors, the method directly encodes the spatial-temporal information as features of the end-to-end gradient boosting model for the estimation of PM2.5. Experimental results of PM2.5 concentration in 2019 across China show that the state-of-the-art method is outperformed by the proposed method by a large margin, with R2 from 0.89 to 0.92, RMSE from 10.35 to 7.89 ?g/m3, and MAE from 6.71 to 5.17 ?g/m3.

Existing studies of air pollutant prediction are mostly interdisciplinary involving environmental science and computer science where the problem is formulated as time series prediction. A prevalent recent approach to time series prediction is the Encoder-Decoder model, which is based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) such as long short-term memory (LSTM), and great potential has been demonstrated. An LSTM network relies on various gate units, but in most existing studies the correlation between gate units is ignored. This correlation is important for establishing the relationship of the random variables in a time series as the stronger is this correlation, the stronger is the relationship between the random variables. In this paper we propose an improved LSTM, named Read-first LSTM or RLSTM for short, which is a more powerful temporal feature extractor than RNN, LSTM and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). RLSTM has some useful properties: (1) enables better store and remember capabilities in longer time series and (2) overcomes the problem of dependency between gate units. Since RLSTM is good at long term feature extraction, it is expected to perform well in time series prediction. Therefore, we use RLSTM as the Encoder and LSTM as the Decoder to build an Encoder-Decoder model (EDSModel) for pollutant prediction in this paper. Our experimental results show, for 1 to 24 h prediction, the proposed prediction model performed well with a root mean square error of 30.218.

Missing data is a common issue for all the domains, especially for environmental data analysis. Most of the research study tries to solve all these problems of time series data using different models. This research study presents a novel deep learning-based hybrid model architecture to solve these issues in a single training process. We come up with Multi-directional Temporal Convolutional Artificial Neural Network (MTCAN) model to impute and forecast PM2.5 pollutant concentration in a single training process. The main idea of the multi-directional properties of MTCAN is to interpolate the PM2.5 pollutant feature matrix to impute its value. Ultimately, it maintains the temporal correlation within the features' measurement and meteorological and pollutant variables to impute PM2.5 missing values. The MTCAN model performs feature learning and sequential modeling simultaneously with a wide range of past observations for long-term forecasting, minimizing memory size requirement and training cost. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model is superior to baseline pollution forecasting models, which prove its effectiveness in air quality modeling.

With the pursuit of sustainable development of China's economy and society, air pollution has been paid more and more attention. The spatial distribution of PM2.5 is affected by multiple factors. In this study, we selected Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, temperature, wind speed and elevation data to analyze the impact of each variable on PM2.5 in different regions of China. The results show that the high-value areas of PM2.5 were mainly concentrated in the North China Plain, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain, the Sichuan Basin, and the Tarim Basin. PM2.5 showed an upward trend in North China, Northeast China and Northwest China, while in most of South China, especially the Sichuan Basin, PM2.5 showed a downward trend. Therefore, the northern region of China needs to take measures to curb the growth of PM2.5. In Northwest China, wind speed and temperature had a greater impact on PM2.5. In North China, wind speed had a greater impact on PM2.5. In southern China, temperature and NDVI had a greater impact on PM2.5. The deep learning model can better simulate the spatial distribution of PM2.5 based on the selected variables. The clustering effect of single variable is better than multivariate spatial information clustering based on principal component analysis (PCA). It is difficult to explain which variable has the greatest impact on PCA clustering. This study can provide an important reference for PM2.5 prevention and control in different regions of China.

In order to prevent air pollution, pollutant parameters must be evaluated within the framework of a model. Recently, in order to obtain objective and more sensitive results with regard to air pollution nowadays, studies, which use machine learning algorithms in artificial intelligence technologies, have been carried out. In this study, PM10 concentrations, which are obtained from 7 stations in Ankara province in Turkey, were trained with machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVR, RF, kNN, xGBoost, ANN). The PM10 concentrations of the years 2009Â2017 of 6 stations in Ankara were given as input, and the PM10 concentrations of the seventh station for the year 2018 were predicted. The model development stage was repeated for each station, and the performance and error rates of the algorithms were determined by comparing the results produced by the algorithms with the actual results.

In this paper, we propose a new Hybrid Interpretable Predictive Machine Learning model for the Particulate Matter 2.5 prediction, which carries two novelties. First, a hybrid model structure is constructed with deep neural network and Nonlinear Auto Regressive Moving Average with Exogenous Input model. Second, automatic feature generation and feature selection procedures are integrated into this hybrid model.

The LCS features integrate machine learning based calibration models and virtual sensors. LCS performances are analyzed and some LCS variables with low performance are improved through intelligent field-calibrations. Meteorological variables are calibrated using linear dynamic models.While, due to the non-linear relationship to reference instruments, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are calibrated using non-linear machine learning models. However, due to sensor drifts or faults, carbon dioxide (CO2) does not present correlation to reference instrument. As a result, the LCS for CO2 is not feasible to be calibrated. Hence, to estimate the CO2 concentration,mathematicalmodels are developed to be integrated in the calibrated LCS, known as a virtual sensor. In addition, another virtual sensor is developed to demonstrate the capability of estimating air pollutant concentrations, e.g. black carbon, when the physical sensor devices are not available. In our paper, calibration models and virtual sensors are established using corresponding reference instruments that are installed on two reference stations. This strategy generalizes the models of calibration and virtual sensing which then allows LCS to be deployed in field independently with a high accuracy.

Geological CO2 storage (GCS) offers a promising solution to overcome this critical environmental issue by removing some of the CO2 emissions. The performance of GCS projects depends directly on the solubility and residual trapping efficiency of CO2 in a saline aquifer. This study models the solubility trapping index (STI) and residual trapping index (RTI) of CO2 in saline aquifers by applying four robust machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. Extreme learning machine (ELM), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), general regression neural network (GRNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN) are applied to 6811 compiled simulation records from published studies to provide accurate STI and RTI predictions. Employing different statistical error metrics coupled with supplementary evaluations, involving score and robustness analyses, the prediction accuracy of the models proposed is comparatively assessed. The findings of the study revealed that the LSSVM model delivers the lowest RMSE values: 0.0043 (STI) and 0.0105 (RTI) with few outlying predictions. Presenting the highest STI and RTI prediction scores the LSSVM is distinguished as the most credible model among all the four models studied. The models consider eight input variables, of which the time elapsed and injection rate displays the strongest correlations with STI and RTI, respectively. The results suggest that the proposed LSSVM model is best suited for monitoring CO2 sequestration efficiency from the data variables considered.

This paper reports a robust forecasting system to achieve accurate multi-step ahead forecasting of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. First, correlation analysis is adopted to screen the spatial information on pollution and meteorology that may facilitate the prediction of concentrations in a target city. Then, a spatial–temporal attention mechanism is used to assign weights to original inputs from both space and time dimensions to enhance the essential information. Subsequently, the residual-based convolutional neural network with feature extraction capabilities is employed to model the refined inputs. Finally, five accuracy metrics and two additional statistical tests are applied to comprehensively assess the performance of the proposed forecasting system. In addition, experimental studies of three major cities in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration region indicate that the forecasting system outperforms various prevalent baseline models in terms of accuracy and stability.

This study implements the SOM to effectively extract and clearly distinguish the spatio-temporal features of long-term regional PM2.5 concentrations in a visible two-dimensional topological map. The spatial distribution of the configured topological map spans the long-term datasets of 25 monitoring stations in northern Taiwan using the Kriging method, and the temporal behavior of PM2.5 concentrations at various time scales (i.e., yearly, seasonal, and hourly) are explored in detail. Finally, we establish a machine learning model to predict PM2.5 concentrations for high pollution events.

We then present successful demonstrations in stiff systems of RobertsonÂs problem and an air pollution problem. The demonstrations show that the usage of deep networks with rectified activations, proper scaling of the network outputs as well as loss functions, and stabilized gradient calculations are the key techniques enabling the learning of stiff neural ODEs. The success of learning stiff neural ODEs opens up possibilities of using neural ODEs in applications with widely varying time-scales, such as chemical dynamics in energy conversion, environmental engineering, and life sciences.

Poor air quality does not have only serious adverse effects on human health and vegetation but also some major negative political, societal, and economic impacts. Hence, it is essential to invest more effort on accurate forecasting of ambient air pollution to provide practical and relevant solutions, achieve acceptable air quality, and plan for prevention. In this work, we propose a flexible and efficient deep learning-driven model to forecast concentrations of ambient pollutants. This article introduces first the traditional variational autoencoder (VAE) and the attention mechanism to develop the forecasting modeling strategy based on the innovative integrated multiple directed attention (IMDA) deep learning architecture. To assess the performance of the proposed forecasting methodology, experimental validation is then performed using air pollution data from four US states. Six statistical indicators have been used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy. A discussion of the results obtained finally demonstrates the satisfying performance of integrated multiple directed attention variational autoencoder (IMDA-VAE) methods to forecast different pollutants in different locations. Furthermore, results indicate that the proposed IMDA-VAE model can effectively improve air pollution forecasting performance and outperforms the deep learning models, namely VAE, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), bidirectional LSTM, bidirectional GRU, and ConvLSTM. We also showed that the forecasting results of the proposed model surpass the performance of LSTM and GRU with the attention mechanism.

The large availability of sensor data enables the adoption of analytical tools to provide decision support capabilities. Employing sensors facilitates air pollution monitoring, but the lack of predictive capability limits such systemsÂ potential in practical scenarios. On the other hand, forecasting methods offer the opportunity to predict the future pollution in specific areas, potentially suggesting useful preventive measures. To date, many works tackled the problem of air pollution forecasting, most of which are based on sequence models. These models are trained with raw pollution data and are subsequently utilized to make predictions. This paper proposes a novel approach evaluating four different architectures that utilize camera images to estimate the air pollution in those areas. These images are further enhanced with weather data to boost the classification accuracy. The proposed approach exploits generative adversarial networks combined with data augmentation techniques to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves robust accuracy of up to 0.88, which is comparable to sequence models and conventional models that utilize air pollution data. This is a remarkable result considering that the historic air pollution data is directly related to the outputÂfuture air pollution data, whereas the proposed architecture uses camera images to recognize the air pollutionÂwhich is an inherently much more difficult problem.

It is vital for us to predict the air quality for determining the further prevention measures of avoiding the brought disasters. In this paper, we are going to propose an approach of predicting the air quality based on the multiple data features through fusing the multiple machine learning models. The approach takes the meteorological data and air quality data for the past six days as one batch of input (the whole data set is for 46 days) and employs a multi-model fusion to provide an improved 24-hour prediction of PM2.5 pollutant concentration all over Beijing. During the above process, two focal feature groups are composed. The first focal feature group contains the historical meteorological data, while the second group includes the statistical information, the date information and the polynomial variations. Besides the two groups, we complement one million more data items by employing the time sliding means. Among the supplementary data, we select the most critical 500 features with Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model and send the features as the input to Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and LightGBM models. Meanwhile, we screen the most critical 300 features with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model and send them as the input to the three prediction models. Referring to each of the models, we respectively gain the optimal parameters through grid search methods and then fuse the modelsÂ contribution with the linear weighting. The experiments indicate that the proposed approach based on the weighting fusion is better than that provided by a single modeling scheme, and the loss value is 0.4158 under the SMAPE index.

These effects are still not well understood due to limited surface observations and uncertainties in chemical model simulations. We developed a four-dimensional spatiotemporal deep forest (4D-STDF) model to estimate daily PM2.5 chemical composition at a spatial resolution of 1 km in China since 2000 by integrating measurements of PM2.5 species from a high-density observation network, satellite PM2.5 retrievals, atmospheric reanalyses, and model simulations. Cross-validation results illustrate the reliability of sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), and chloride (Cl-) estimates, with high coefficients of determination (CV-R2) with ground-based observations of 0.74, 0.75, 0.71, and 0.66, and average root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 6.0, 6.6, 4.3, and 2.3 μg/m3, respectively. The three components of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs) account for 21% (SO42-), 20% (NO3-), and 14% (NH4+) of the total PM2.5 mass in eastern China; we observed significant reductions in the mass of inorganic components by 40-43% between 2013 and 2020, slowing down since 2018. Comparatively, the ratio of SIA to PM2.5 increased by 7% across eastern China except in Beijing and nearby areas, accelerating in recent years. SO42- has been the dominant SIA component in eastern China, although it was surpassed by NO3- in some areas, e.g., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region since 2016. SIA, accounting for nearly half (∼46%) of the PM2.5 mass, drove the explosive formation of winter haze episodes in the North China Plain. A sharp decline in SIA concentrations and an increase in SIA-to-PM2.5 ratios during the COVID-19 lockdown were also revealed, reflecting the enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity and formation of secondary particles. © 2023 American Chemical Society",Environmental Science and Technology,10.1021/acs.est.3c00272,14,14,No,,,,"United States,China,Germany,Hong Kong,South Korea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Precise forecast of PM2.5 concentrations is very important to control air pollution and improve people's life quality. In the subway indoor air quality (IAQ) system, the data collected by telemonitoring systems is frequently lost due to many reasons. A deep learning model called RF-CNN-GRU, which combines random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), is proposed to predict atmospheric PM2.5 concentrations with incomplete original data. The RF-CNN-GRU model employs the RF to fill in missing values in the data and subsequently applies the CNN to extract features from the imputed data. The data is finally sent to the GRU network to train and predict PM2.5 concentrations. Comparing with single CNN, GRU and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, the predictive accuracy of the RF-CNN-GRU model is significantly improved. The RF-CNN-GRU model shows a slight improvement in prediction results when compared to models such as CNN-GRU, RF-CNN, RF-GRU, and RF-LSTM.

However, the distribution of air pollution monitoring sites is not even making the spatiotemporal correlation between the central site and surrounding sites vary with different density of sites, and this was neglected by previous methods. To this end, this study proposes a weighted long short-term memory neural network extended model (WLSTME), which addressed the issue that how to consider the effect of the density of sites and wind conditions on the spatiotemporal correlation of air pollution concentration. First, a number of nearest surrounding sites were chosen as the neighbor sites to the central site, and their distance, as well as their air pollution concentration and wind condition, were input to multilayer perception (MLP) to generate weighted historical PM2.5 time series data. Second, historical PM2.5 concentration of the central site and weighted PM2.5 series data of neighbor sites were input into a long short-term memory (LSTM) to address spatiotemporal dependency simultaneously and extract spatiotemporal features. Finally, another MLP was utilized to integrate spatiotemporal features extracted above with the meteorological data of the central site to generate the forecasts future PM2.5 concentration of the central site. Daily PM2.5 concentration and meteorological data on BeijingÂTianjinÂHebei from 2015 to 2017 were collected to train models and to evaluate its performance. Experimental results with three existing methods showed that the proposed WLSTME model has the lowest RMSE (40.67) and MAE (26.10) and the highest p (0.59). Further experiments showed that in all seasons and regions, WLSTME performed the best. This finding confirms that WLSTME can significantly improve PM2.5 prediction accuracy.

The purpose of this study was Spatio-temporal modeling and preparation of PM2.5 risk mapping using three machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF), AdaBoost, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD)) in the metropolis of Tehran, Iran. Therefore, in the first step, to prepare the dependent variable data, the PM2.5 average was used for the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Then, using remote sensing (RS) and a geographic information system (GIS), independent data such as temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, rainfall, humidity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population density, street density, and distance to industrial centers were prepared as a seasonal average. To Spatio-temporal modeling using machine learning algorithms, 70% of the data were used for training and 30% for validation. The frequency ratio (FR) model was used as input to machine learning algorithms to calculate the spatial relationship between PM2.5 and the effective parameters. Finally, Spatio-temporal modeling and PM2.5 risk mapping were performed using three machine learning algorithms. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) results showed that the RF algorithm had the greatest modeling accuracy, with values of 0.926, 0.94, 0.949, and 0.949 for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively.

Firstly, the Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC) is designed for spatiotemporal correlation analysis, fully considering the linearity, non-linearity and non-functionality between the data of each monitoring station. The potential inherent features of the input data are effectively extracted through the convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, an optimized long short-term memroy (LSTM) network captures the short-term mutations of the time series. An attention mechanism is further designed for the proposed model, which automatically assigns different weights to different feature states at different time stages to distinguish their importance, and can achieve precise temporal and spatial interpretability. In order to further explore the long-term time features, we propose a Bi-LSTM parallel module to extract the periodic characteristics of PM2.5 concentration from both previous and posterior directions. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset indicates that the proposed model outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, evaluations of recall (0.790), precision (0.848) (threshold: 151 ?g/m3) for 72 h prediction also verify the feasibility of our proposed model. The methodology can be used for predicting other multivariate time series data in the future.

Monitoring, modeling, and forecasting air quality would be a prudent way to promote awareness and defend human beings from the adversities of air pollution. The air quality of a region is monitored through various air quality monitoring stations built in and around it. The air quality data collected from these stations are highly dynamic, nonlinear, and hold intensely stochastic spatiotemporal correlations in them. Deep learning algorithms that are capable of extracting a higher level of abstraction in data can efficiently capture the spatiotemporal features in it. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deep learning model named DL-Air that embodies three components for air quality forecasting. The first component, the encoder, encodes all spatial relations in the data. The second component, STAA-LSTM, a proposed variant of LSTM, identifies all temporal relations and the level of association between the identified spatiotemporal relation and the forecast. Also, the STAA-LSTM predicts the future spatiotemporal relations in the latent space. The third component, decoder suitably decodes these relations to obtain the actual forecast. The proposed framework was extensively evaluated for forecasting the real-world air quality data of Delhi. DL-Air shows better performance with around 30% reduced RMSE and MAE, 37% reduced AAD, 11% improved R2 and 8% improved accuracy in AQI category prediction than the best performing baseline approaches. Also, the predictive performance of DL-Air is found to be consistent across all seasons in Delhi.

The inability to assess PM2.5 concentrations have limited the assessment of the health impact of these exposures, both in the native populations and previously deployed military personnel. As part of a Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program health study of land-based U.S. military personnel who were previously deployed to these countries, we developed a novel approach to estimate spatially and temporarily resolved daily PM2.5 exposures 2001Â2018. Since visibility is proportional to ground-level particulate matter concentrations, we were able to take advantage of extensive airport visibility data that became available as a result of regional military operations over this time period. First, we combined a random forest machine learning and a generalized additive mixed model to estimate daily high resolution (1 km Ã 1 km) visibility over the region using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) and airport visibility data. The spatially and temporarily resolved visibility data were then used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations from 2001 to 2018 by converting visibility to PM2.5 using empirical relationships derived from available regional PM2.5 monitoring stations. We adjusted for spatially resolved meteorological parameters, land use variables, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and satellite-derived estimates of surface dust as a measure of sandstorm activity. Cross validation indicated good model predictive ability (R2 = 0.71), and there were considerable spatial and temporal differences in PM2.5 across the region. Annual average PM2.5 predictions for Iraq and Kuwait were 37 and 41 ?g/m3, respectively, which are greater than current U.S. and WHO standards. PM2.5 concentrations in many U.S. bases and large cities (e.g. Bagdad, Balad, Kuwait city, Karbala, Najaf, and Diwaniya) had annual average PM2.5 concentrations above 45 ?g/m3 with weekly averages as high as 150 ?g/m3 depending on calendar year. The highest annual PM2.5 concentration for both Kuwait and Iraq were observed in 2008, followed by 2009, which was associated with extreme drought in these years. The lowest PM2.5 values were observed in 2014. On average, July had the highest concentrations, and November had the lowest values, consistent with seasonal patterns of air pollution in this region. This is the first study that estimates long-term PM2.5 exposures in Iraq and Kuwait at a high resolution based on measurements data that will allow the study of health effects and contribute to the development of regional environmental policies. The novel approach demonstrated may be used in other parts of the world with limited monitoring networks.

Recently, deep learning has emerged as a general-purpose technology to extract complex knowledge using massive amount of data and very large networks of neurons and thus has the potential to break the limits of air quality forecasts. Here, we provide a brief review of recent attempts on using deep learning techniques in air quality forecasts. We first introduce architectures of deep networks (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory neural networks, and spatiotemporal deep network) and their relevance to explore the nonlinear spatiotemporal features across multiple scales of air pollution. We then examine the potential of deep learning techniques for air quality forecasts in diverse aspects, namely, data gap filling, prediction algorithms, improvements of CTMs, estimations with satellite data, and source estimations for atmospheric dispersion forecasts.

Unavailability of free parking spaces is one of the major reasons for traffic jams. Congestion and parking are interrelated because searching for a free parking spot creates additional delays and increase local circulation. In the center of large cities, 10% of the traffic circulation is due to cruising, as drivers nearly spend 20 min searching for free parking space. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a parking space availability prediction system that can inform the drivers in advance about the location-wise, day-wise, and hour-wise occupancy of parking lots. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on a deep long short term memory network to predict the availability of parking space with the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), cloud technology, and sensor networks. We use the Birmingham parking sensors dataset to evaluate the performance of deep long short term memory networks. Three types of experiments are performed to predict the availability of free parking space which is based on location, days of a week, and working hours of a day.

Recently, the emergence of Machine Learning techniques justifies the application of statistical approaches for environmental modeling, especially in air quality forecasting. In this context, we propose a novel feature ranking method, termed as Ensemble of Regressor Chains-guided Feature Ranking (ERCFR) to forecast multiple air pollutants simultaneously over two cities. This approach is based on a combination of one of the most powerful ensemble methods for Multi-Target Regression problems (Ensemble of Regressor Chains) and the Random Forest permutation importance measure. Thus, feature selection allowed the model to obtain the best results with a restricted subset of features.

Studies focusing on air quality prediction, influential factors analysis, and control policy evaluation are increasing. When conducting these studies, valid and high-quality air pollution data are necessarily required to generate reasonable results. Missing data, which is frequently contained in the collected raw data, therefore, has become a significant barrier. Existing methods on missing data either cannot effectively capture the temporal and spatial mechanism of air pollution or focus on sequences with low missing rates and random missing positions. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new imputation methodology, namely transferred long short-term memory-based iterative estimation (TLSTM-IE) to impute consecutive missing values with large missing rates. A case study is conducted in New York City to verify the effectiveness and priority of the proposed methodology. Long-interval consecutive missing PM2.5 concentration data are filled. Experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively learn from long-term dependencies and transfer the learned knowledge. The imputation accuracy of the TLSTM-IE model is 25Â50% higher than other commonly seen methods. The novelty of this study lies in two aspects. First is that we target at long-interval consecutive missing data, which has not been addressed before by existing studies in atmospheric research. Second is the novel application of transfer learning on missing values imputation. To our best knowledge, no research on air quality has implemented this technique on this problem before.

However, the scientific understanding of the ways in which complex interactions of meteorological factors lead to high-pollution episodes is inconclusive. In this study, a novel, data-driven approach based on empirical relationships is used to characterize and better understand the meteorology-driven component of PM1 variability. A tree-based machine learning model is set up to reproduce concentrations of speciated PM1 at a suburban site southwest of Paris, France, using meteorological variables as input features. The model is able to capture the majority of occurring variance of mean afternoon total PM1 concentrations (coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.58), with model performance depending on the individual PM1 species predicted. Based on the models, an isolation and quantification of individual, season-specific meteorological influences for process understanding at the measurement site is achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) regression values. Model results suggest that winter pollution episodes are often driven by a combination of shallow mixed layer heights (MLHs), low temperatures, low wind speeds, or inflow from northeastern wind directions. Contributions of MLHs to the winter pollution episodes are quantified to be on average similar to 5 mu g/m(3) for MLHs below < 500 m a.g.l. Temperatures below freezing initiate formation processes and increase local emissions related to residential heating, amounting to a contribution to predicted PM1 concentrations of as much as similar to 9 mu g/m(3). Northeasterly winds are found to contribute similar to 5 mu g/m(3) to predicted PM1 concentrations (combined effects of u- and v -wind components), by advecting particles from source regions, e.g. central Europe or the Paris region. Meteorological drivers of unusually high PM1 concentrations in summer are temperatures above similar to 25 degrees C (contributions of up to similar to 2.5 mu g/m(3)), dry spells of several days (maximum contributions of similar to 1.5 mu g/m(3)), and wind speeds below similar to 2 m/s (maximum contributions of similar to 3 mu g/m(3)), which cause a lack of dispersion. High-resolution case studies are conducted showing a large variability of processes that can lead to high-pollution episodes.

However, the potentially differential effects of submicron particulate matter (PM; PM with aerodynamic diameter <= 1 mm [PM1]) remain largely unknown. Objective: This study primarily aimed to investigate associations of childhood asthma and wheezing with in utero and first-year exposures to size-specific particles. Methods: We conducted a large cross-sectional survey among 5788 preschool children aged 3 to 5 years in central China. In utero and first-year exposures to ambient PM1, PM with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 mu m, and PM with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 mu m at 1 x 1-km resolution were assessed using machine learning- based spatiotemporal models. A time-to-event analysis was performed to examine associations between residential PM exposures and childhood onset of asthma and wheezing. Results: Early-life size-specific PM exposures, particularly during pregnancy, were significantly associated with increased risk of asthma, whereas no evident PM-wheezing associations were observed. Each 10-mu g/m(3) increase in in utero and first-year PM1 exposure was accordingly associated with an asthma's hazard ratio in childhood of 1.618 (95% CI, 1.159-2.258; P = .005) and 1.543 (0.822-2.896; P = .177). Subgroup analyses suggest that short breast-feeding duration may aggravate PM associated risk of childhood asthma. Each 10-mu g/m(3) increase in in utero exposure to PM1, for instance, was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.260 (1.393-3.666) among children with 0 to 5 months' breast-feeding and 1.156 (0.721-1.853) among those longer breast-fed.

The high ozone concertation (OZC) affects the environment and public health. Since OZC depends on the number of different variables, it is difficult and complex to predict ozone concertation. A multilayer perceptron model is robust for predicting ozone concertation, although it has some limitations. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model may be unable to extract spatial and temporal features from time series data. Additionally, modelers need to developed models for handling unstructured and structured data. The purpose of this study is to combine deep learning models with MLP models to extract spatial and temporal features and improve the accuracy of predictions. We coupled deep learning models with the MLP model to overcome the limitations of the MLP model. We propose two new hybrid deep models for predicting ozone concertation. Graph convolutional network (GCN)-Long short term memory neural network (LSTM)-multi layer perceptron model (MLP)- Gaussian progress models (GPR) and convolutional neural network (CNN)-LSTM-MLP-GPR are introduced to predict hourly ozone concentration. Novelties of the papers include the development of a new model for spatial feature extraction, the introduction of a new model for temporal feature extraction, and the quantification of uncertainty. Spatial features can be extracted using CNN and GCN models. The LSTM model is a robust model for extracting temporal features. The GPR model quantifies uncertainty values. We use the models to predict ozone concentrations in three stations of Malaysia and one basin in Iran (Sefidrood basin).

This problem has been exacerbated by an overabundance of automobiles, industrial output pollution, transportation fuel consumption, and energy generation. As a result, air pollution forecasting has become vital. As a result of the large amount and variety of data acquired by air pollution monitoring stations, air pollution forecasting has become a popular topic, particularly when applying deep learning models of long short-term memory (LSTM). The ability of these models to learn long-term dependencies in air pollution data sets them apart. However, LSTM models using many other statistical and machine learning approaches may not offer adequate prediction results due to noisy data and improper hyperparameter settings. As a result, to define the pollution levels for a group of contaminants, an ideal representation of the LSTM is required.

To this end, a dual-scale ensemble learning framework is proposed for the complex AQI time series prediction. First, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and sample entropy (SE) are used to decompose and reconstruct AQI series to reduce the difficulty of direct modeling. Then, according to the characteristics of high and low frequencies, the high-frequency components are predicted by the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), and the low-frequency items are predicted by the regularized extreme learning machine (RELM). At the same time, the improved whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is used to optimize the hyper-parameters of RELM and LSTM models. Finally, the hybrid prediction model proposed in this paper predicts the AQI of four cities in China. This work effectively improves the prediction accuracy of AQI, which is of great significance to the sustainable development of the cities.

This has led to increased problems related to congestion control, which has a direct impact on citizens: air pollution, fuel consumption, violation of traffic rules, noise pollution, accidents and loss of time. In Latin America, the disorderly growth of cities increases distances and routes, likewise, there is an accelerated increase in the number of cars and motorcycles, which increases the problem. In this sense, intelligent transport systems are an alternative to improve the traffic environment, they incorporate the internet of things and intelligent algorithms, for the collection of data from multiple sources and information processing, respectively, in order to improve the efficiency of the transport flow. However, the processing and modeling of traffic data is challenging due to the complexity of road networks, the spaceÂtime dependencies between them, and heterogeneous traffic patterns.

This research proposes a large-scale, low-cost solution for detecting air pollution by combining hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology and deep learning techniques. By modeling the visible-light HSI technology of the aerial camera, the image acquired by the drone camera is endowed with hyperspectral information. Two methods are used for the classification of the images. That is, 3D Convolutional Neural Network Auto Encoder and principal components analysis (PCA) are paired with VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group) to find the optical properties of air pollution.

Flexible statistical methods for prediction have demonstrated the integration of satellite observations with other predictors, yet these algorithms are susceptible to overfitting the spatiotemporal structure of the training datasets. We present a new approach for predicting PM2.5 using machine-learning methods and evaluating prediction models for the goal of making predictions where they were not previously available. We apply extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) modeling to predict daily PM2.5 on a 1 Ã 1 km2 resolution for a 13 state region in the Northeastern USA for the years 2000Â2015 using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth and implement a recursive feature selection to develop a parsimonious model. We demonstrate excellent predictions of withheld observations but also contrast an RMSE of 3.11 ?g/m3 in our spatial cross-validation withholding nearby sites versus an overfit RMSE of 2.10 ?g/m3 using a more conventional random ten-fold splitting of the dataset. As the field of exposure science moves forward with the use of advanced machine-learning approaches for spatiotemporal modeling of air pollutants, our results show the importance of addressing data leakage in training, overfitting to spatiotemporal structure, and the impact of the predominance of ground monitoring sites in dense urban sub-networks on model evaluation. The strengths of our resultant modeling approach for exposure in epidemiologic studies of PM2.5 include improved efficiency, parsimony, and interpretability with robust validation while still accommodating complex spatiotemporal relationships.

However, most of the previous forecasting models only considered either temporal or spatial prediction. The effects of different inputs, model structures and leading hours on the model performance were still less investigated. In this study, three kinds of deep learning neural networks (the long short-term memory (LSTM), the convolutional neural networks (CNN), and CNN-LSTM) were developed for 1- to 24-h forecasting of spatiotemporal PM2.5 concentrations. The back propagation neural network (BPNN) was employed as the control model. Three types of input data (previous PM2.5 concentrations plus meteorological data, air quality data and the six most correlated variables, respectively) at multiple stations in Beijing from 2015 to 2016 were employed for model development. The results showed that PM2.5 concentrations in the past hours, hybrid air quality indexes or other pollutant concentrations, and wind speed can be used as good candidate predictors. For the 1-h forecasting, the LSTM and the CNN-LSTM with the most correlated variables were the best models with top 2 performance. For the 2- to 24-h forecasting, the LSTM was the optimal model for forecasting over 12 h while the CNN-LSTM was generally better for forecasting within 12 h. This study demonstrated that deep learning outperformed shallow learning models in hourly PM2.5 forecasting and suggested that optimizing the input and structure of the model helped to improve the performance of multiple-hour PM2.5 forecasting.

By incorporating wavelet decomposition (WD) into the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a hybrid XGBoost-WD model was established to obtain the full-coverage PM2.5 estimation at 3-km spatial resolution in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA). In this study, 3-km-resolution meteorological fields simulated by WRF along with AOD derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were served as explanatory variables. Model MW and Model NW were developed using XGBoost-WD for the areas with and without AOD respectively to obtain a full-coverage PM2.5 mapping in the YRDUA. The XGBoost-WD model showed good performances in estimating PM2.5 with R2 of 0.80 in the Model MW and 0.87 in the Model NW. Moreover, the K-value of Model MW increased from 0.77 to 0.79 and that of Model NM increased from 0.81 to 0.86 compared with the model without the step of WD, indicating an improvement on the problem of PM2.5 underestimation. Due to a better ability of capturing abrupt changes in the PM2.5 concentrations, the spatial evolution of PM2.5 during a typical pollution event could be mapped more accurately. Finally, the analysis of variable importance showed that the three most important variables in the estimation of the low-frequency coefficients of PM2.5 (PM2.5_A4) were temperature at 2 m (T2), day of year (DOY) and longitude (LON), while that in the high-frequency coefficients of PM2.5 (PM2.5_D) were CO, AOD and NO2. This study not only provided an effective solution to the PM2.5 underestimation and AOD missing problems in the PM2.5 estimation, but also proposed a new method to further refine the sophisticated correlations between PM2.5 and some spatiotemporal variables.

In this study, we systematically examined the spatiotemporal variations of six air pollutants and conducted ozone prediction using machine learning (ML) algorithms in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The annual-average concentrations of CO, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 decreased at a rate of 141, 11.0, 6.6 and 5.6 ?g/m3/year, while a pattern of initial increase and later decrease was observed for NO2 and O3_8 h. The concentration of SO2, CO and NO2 was higher in Tangshan and Xingtai, while northern BTH region has lower levels of CO, NO2 and PM. Spatial variations of ozone were relatively small in the BTH region. Monthly variations of PM10 displayed an increase in March probably due to wind-blown dusts from Northwest China. A seasonal and diurnal pattern with summer and afternoon peaks was found for ozone, which was contrast with other pollutants. Further ML algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) model and Decision tree (DT) regression showed good ozone prediction performance (daily: R2 = 0.83 and 0.73, RMSE = 30.0 and 37.3 ?g/m3, respectively; monthly: R2 = 0.93 and 0.88, RMSE = 12.1 and 15.8 ?g/m3, respectively) based on 10-fold cross-validation. Both RF model and DT regression relied more on the spatial trend as higher temporal prediction performance was achieved. Solar radiation- and temperature-related variables presented high importance at daily level, whereas sea level pressure dominated at monthly level. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity in variable importance was further confirmed using case studies based on RF model. In addition, variable importance was possibly influenced by the emission reductions due to COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its possible weakness to capture ozone extremes, RF model was beneficial and suggested for predicting spatiotemporal variations of ozone in future studies.

Air quality prediction can provide useful information for urban environmental governance decision-making and residentsÂ daily health control. However, existing research methods have suffered from a weak ability to capture the spatial correlations and fail to model the long-term temporal dependencies of air quality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-scale spatiotemporal graph convolution network (MST-GCN), which consists of a multi-scale block, several spatial-temporal blocks and a fusion block. We first divide the extracted features into several groups based on their domain categories, and represent the spatial correlations across stations as two graphs. Then we combine the grouped features and the constructed graphs in pairs to form a multi-scale block that feeds into spatial-temporal blocks. Each spatial-temporal block contains a graph convolution layer and a temporal convolution layer, which can model the spatial correlations and long-term temporal dependencies. To capture the group interactions, we use a fusion block to fuse multiple groups. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our model achieves the highest performance compared with state-of-the-art and baseline models for air quality prediction.

The utilization of solid waste materials in concrete has gained the attention of the researchers. Ceramic waste powder (CWP) is considered to be one of the most harmful wastes for the environment, which may cause water, soil, and air pollution. The aim of this study was comprised of two phases. Phase one was based on the characterization of CWP with respect to its composition, material testing (coarse ag-gregate, fine aggregate, cement,) and evaluation of concrete properties both in fresh and hardened states (slump, 28 days compressive strength, and dry density). Concrete mixes were prepared in order to evaluate the compressive strength (CS) of the control mix, with partial replacement of the cement with CWP of 10 and 20% by mass of cement and 60 prepared mixes.

Reasoning is applied on such sensor data in order to compute prediction. Generating a health warning that is based on prediction of atmospheric pollution, planning timely evacuation of people from vulnerable areas with respect to prediction of natural disasters, etc., are the use cases of sensor data stream where prediction is vital to protect people and assets. Thus, prediction accuracy is of paramount importance to take preventive steps and avert any untoward situation. Uncertainties of sensor data is a severe factor which hampers prediction accuracy. Belief Rule Based Expert System (BRBES), a knowledge-driven approach, is a widely employed prediction algorithm to deal with such uncertainties based on knowledge base and inference engine. In connection with handling uncertainties, it offers higher accuracy than other such knowledge-driven techniques, e.g., fuzzy logic and Bayesian probability theory. Contrarily, Deep Learning is a data-driven technique, which constitutes a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI). By applying analytics on huge amount of data, Deep Learning learns the hidden representation of data. Thus, Deep Learning can infer prediction by reasoning over available data, such as historical data and sensor data streams. Combined application of BRBES and Deep Learning can compute prediction with improved accuracy by addressing sensor data uncertainties while utilizing its discovered data pattern. Hence, this paper proposes a novel predictive model that is based on the integrated approach of BRBES and Deep Learning. The uniqueness of this model lies in the development of a mathematical model to combine Deep Learning with BRBES and capture the nonlinear dependencies among the relevant variables. We optimized BRBES further by applying parameter and structure optimization on it. Air pollution prediction has been taken as use case of our proposed combined approach. This model has been evaluated against two different datasets. One dataset contains synthetic images with a corresponding label of PM2.5 concentrations. The other one contains real images, PM2.5 concentrations, and numerical weather data of Shanghai, China. We also distinguished a hazy image between polluted air and fog through our proposed model. Our approach has outperformed only BRBES and only Deep Learning in terms of prediction accuracy. Â© 2020 by the authors.

Air pollution is one of the significant issues in smart cities. The higher value of PM2.5 can cause various health issues like respiratory disease, heart attack, lung disease, and fatigue. Predicting PM2.5 can help the administration to warn people at risk and make scientific measures to reduce pollution. Existing work has utilized various regression models to predict air pollution; however, different feature selection techniques with the regression algorithm have not yet been explored. This paper has implemented five feature selection techniques (namely, Recursive Feature Elimination, Analysis of Variance, Random Forest, Variance Threshold, and Light Gradient Boosting) to select the best features. Further, six regression algorithms and ensemble models (Extra Tree, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Random Forest, Light GBM, and AdaBoost) are applied to predict PM2.5 using python language on the dataset of five cities of China. The models are compared based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R2 parameters. We observed that the AdaBoost algorithm with the Light GBM feature selection technique gives the highest performance among all the five datasets.

Despite EVs’ many advantages, widespread adoption will negatively affect the electric grid due to their random and volatile nature. Consequently, predicting the charging demand for electric vehicles is becoming a priority to maintain a steady supply of electric energy. Time series methodologies are applied to predict the charging demand: traditional and deep learning. RNN, LSTM, and transformers represent deep learning approaches, while ARIMA and SARIMA are traditional techniques. This research represents one of the first attempts to use the Transformer model for predicting EV charging demand. Predictions for 3-time steps are considered: 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days to address both short-term and long-term forecasting of EV charging load. RMSE and MAE were used to compare the model’s performance. According to the results, the Transformer outperforms the other mentioned models in terms of short-term and long-term predictions, demonstrating its ability to address time series problems, especially EV charging predictions.

Although conventional statistical and machine learning methods have been widely used for air quality forecasting, they have limitations in finding nonlinear relations and modeling sequential data. In recent years, deep learning methods such as long short-term memory, recurrent neural networks, and gated recurrent units have been successfully applied in several research areas, including time-series forecasting. In this study, deep learning algorithm is employed to predict the PM2.5 dataset, including air pollutants (NO, NO2, NOX, O3, PM2.5, SO, and SO2) and meteorological features (wind speed, wind direction, and air temperature) in Istanbul metropolitan. Deep learning algorithms have many hyperparameters such as learning and dropout rate, the number of hidden layers and units in each hidden layer, activation function, loss function, and optimizer that need to be optimized in order to achieve optimal training performance. Therefore, a genetic algorithm-based hyperparameter optimization approach is proposed to find the best parameter combination. The prediction results of deep learning algorithms are compared with default hyperparameters and random search algorithms to confirm the efficacy of the genetic algorithm approach. The proposed method outperforms the other configurations, with the MSE error reduced by 13.38% and 55.30% for testing performance, respectively. The experimental results revealed that genetic algorithms are promising and applicable in hyperparameter optimization of deep neural network models, especially in air quality forecasting. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.",International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,10.1007/s13762-023-04763-6,12,12,Yes,"RNN,LSTM,GRU",,No,Turkey,Prediction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stratospheric ozone protects human beings, but high near-surface ozone concentrations threaten environment and human health. Owing to the uneven distribution of ground-monitoring stations and the low time resolution of polar orbiting satellites, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the refinement and synergistic pollution of near-surface ozone in China. Besides, atmospheric circulation patterns also affect ozone concentrations greatly. In this study, a new generation of geostationary satellite is used to estimate the hourly near-surface ozone concentration with a spatial resolution of 0.05°. First, the Pearson correlation coefficient and maximum information coefficient were used to study the correlation between the top of atmospheric radiation (TOAR) of Himawari-8 satellite and O3 concentration; seven TOAR channels were selected. Second, based on an interpretable deep learning model, the hourly ozone concentration in China from September 2015 to August 2021 was obtained using the TOAR-O3 model. Finally, the self-organizing map method was used to determine six major summer weather circulation patterns in China. The results showed that (1) the near-surface O3 concentration can be accurately estimated; the R2 (RMSE: μg/m3) values of the daily, monthly, and annual tenfold cross validation results were 0.91 (12.74), 0.97 (5.64), and 0.98 (1.75), respectively. The feature importance of the model showed that the temperature, TOAR, and boundary layer height contributed 38 %, 22 %, and 13 %, respectively. (2) The O3 concentration showed obvious spatiotemporal difference and gradually increased from 10:00 to 15:00 (Beijing time) every day. In most areas of China, O3 concentration had increased significantly. (3) The O3 concentration in northern China was the highest under the circulation pattern of the Meiyu front over the Yangtze River Delta, while in southern China, it was the highest under the circulation pattern of the northeast cold vortex controlling most of China. © 2022",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160928,12,12,Yes,DF,,Yes,China,Estimation of spatial near surface concentrations,O3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the intensity varies across regions and countries. Therefore, local studies are essential to accurately assess the correlation of climate change and ozone concentration in different countries. This study investigates the effects of climatic variables on ozone concentration in Malaysia in order to understand the nexus between climate change and ozone concentration. The selected data was obtained from ten (10) air monitoring stations strategically mounted in urban-industrial and residential areas with significant emissions of pollutants. Correlation analysis and four machine learning algorithms (random forest, decision tree regression, linear regression, and support vector regression) were used to analyze ozone and meteorological dataset in the study area. The analysis was carried out during the southwest monsoon due to the rise of ozone in the dry season. The results show a very strong correlation between temperature and ozone. Wind speed also exhibits a moderate to strong correlation with ozone, while relative humidity is negatively correlated. The highest correlation values were obtained at Bukit Rambai, Nilai, Jaya II Perai, Ipoh, Klang and Petaling Jaya. These locations have high industries and are well urbanized. The four machine learning algorithms exhibit high predictive performances, generally ascertaining the predictive accuracy of the climatic variables. The random forest outperformed other algorithms with a very high R2 of 0.970, low RMSE of 2.737 and MAE of 1.824, followed by linear regression, support vector regression and decision tree regression, respectively. This study's outcome indicates a linkage between temperature and wind speed with ozone concentration in the study area. An increase of these variables will likely increase the ozone concentration posing threats to lives and the environment. Therefore, this study provides data-driven insights for decision-makers and other stakeholders in ensuring good air quality for sustainable cities and communities. It also serves as a guide for the government for necessary climate actions to reduce the effect of climate change on air pollution and enabling sustainable cities in accordance with the UN's SDGs 13 and 11, respectively.

Considering the strong spatial correlation of air pollutants, this study focuses on the spatial prediction of AQI and proposes a novel hybrid model combining decomposition, three-stage feature selection, and boosted extreme learning machine. The spatiotemporal features are gradually extracted in three stages, including spatial correlation analysis, mutuality, and binary grey wolf optimization (BGWO). Moreover, decomposition and ensemble methods are adopted to further enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model. Based on maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT), the original AQI series in target site is decomposed into eight subseries with different frequency bands to reduce the non-stationarity of time series. Outlier robust extreme learning machine (ORELM) serves as base predictor, and the adaptive boosting. MRT (Adabost.MRT) is adopted to combine several ORELMs to generate more robust forecasts. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed model, data collected from 1497 air quality monitoring sites in China are used, and six sites are randomly selected as prediction targets. The proposed model is compared with several baseline models and existing models. The results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperforms other models in all target sites.

The data-driven forecasting model can help a better understanding of environmental air quality. The existing data-driven forecasting models usually ignore missing values, the correlations between the pollutant and meteorological factors and fail to perform temporal modeling effectively, affecting prediction accuracy. In response to these issues, we present a deep learning-based Convolutional LSTMÂSDAE (CLS) model to forecast the particulate matter level, revealing the correlation between particulate matter and meteorological factors. In the proposed architecture, the k nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation technique is employed to recover the air quality dataset's missing values.

In addition, Bidirectional Gatted Recurrent Unit (BIGRU) is implemented as both encoder and decoder in Sparse Denoising Autoencoder, which reconstructs the CNNÂLSTM model's output in the dynamic fine-tuning layer to get robust prediction results.

To address this problem, in the last few years, substantial research efforts have been placed in developing statistical methods or machine learning techniques to generate estimates of air pollution at fine spatial and temporal scales (daily, usually) with complete coverage. However, it is not clear how much the predicted exposures yielded by the various methods differ, and which method generates more reliable estimates. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by evaluating a variety of exposure modeling approaches, comparing their predictive performance. Using PM2.5 in year 2011 over the continental U.S. as a case study, we generate national maps of ambient PM2.5 concentration using: (i) ordinary least squares and inverse distance weighting; (ii) kriging; (iii) statistical downscaling models, that is, spatial statistical models that use the information contained in air quality model outputs; (iv) land use regression, that is, linear regression modeling approaches that leverage the information in Geographical Information System (GIS) covariates; and (v) machine learning methods, such as neural networks, random forests and support vector regression. We examine the various methodsÂ predictive performance via cross-validation using Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Deviation, Pearson correlation, and Mean Spatial Pearson Correlation. Additionally, we evaluated whether factors such as, season, urbanicity, and levels of PM2.5 concentration (low, medium or high) affected the performance of the different methods. Overall, statistical methods that explicitly modeled the spatial correlation, e.g. universal kriging and the downscaler model, outperform all the other exposure assessment approaches regardless of season, urbanicity and PM2.5 concentration level. We posit that the better predictive performance of spatial statistical models over machine learning methods is due to the fact that they explicitly account for spatial dependence, thus borrowing information from neighboring observations. In light of our findings, we suggest that future exposure assessment methods for regional PM2.5 incorporate information from neighboring sites when deriving predictions at unsampled locations or attempt to account for spatial dependence.

This is particularly challenging for California, which has high variability in natural (e.g, wildfires, dust) and anthropogenic emissions, meteorology, topography (e.g. desert surfaces, mountains, snow cover) and land use. Methods: Using ensemble-based deep learning with big data fused from multiple sources we developed a PM2.5 prediction model with uncertainty estimates at a high spatial (1 km Ã 1 km) and temporal (weekly) resolution for a 10-year time span (2008Â2017). We leveraged autoencoder-based full residual deep networks to model complex nonlinear interrelationships among PM2.5 emission, transport and dispersion factors and other influential features. These included remote sensing data (MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD), normalized difference vegetation index, impervious surface), MERRA-2 GMI Replay Simulation (M2GMI) output, wildfire smoke plume dispersion, meteorology, land cover, traffic, elevation, and spatiotemporal trends (geo-coordinates, temporal basis functions, time index). As one of the primary predictors of interest with substantial missing data in California related to bright surfaces, cloud cover and other known interferences, missing MAIAC AOD observations were imputed and adjusted for relative humidity and vertical distribution. Wildfire smoke contribution to PM2.5 was also calculated through HYSPLIT dispersion modeling of smoke emissions derived from MODIS fire radiative power using the Fire Energetics and Emissions Research version 1.0 model. Results: Ensemble deep learning to predict PM2.5 achieved an overall mean training RMSE of 1.54 ?g/m3 (R2: 0.94) and test RMSE of 2.29 ?g/m3 (R2: 0.87). The top predictors included M2GMI carbon monoxide mixing ratio in the bottom layer, temporal basis functions, spatial location, air temperature, MAIAC AOD, and PM2.5 sea salt mass concentration. In an independent test using three long-term AQS sites and one short-term non-AQS site, our model achieved a high correlation (&gt;0.8) and a low RMSE (&lt;3 ?g/m3). Statewide predictions indicated that our model can capture the spatial distribution and temporal peaks in wildfire-related PM2.5. The coefficient of variation indicated highest uncertainty over deciduous and mixed forests and open water land covers. Conclusion: Our method can be generalized to other regions, including those having a mix of major urban areas, deserts, intensive smoke events, snow cover and complex terrains, where PM2.5 has previously been challenging to predict. Prediction uncertainty estimates can also inform further model development and measurement error evaluations in exposure and health studies.

We modeled daily average concentrations in August 2016-December 2017 across 50 sites. Land use variables included 13 time-independent (e.g., elevation) and time-dependent (e.g., temperature) predictors. We examined two models: LUR and a machine-learning-enabled land use model (land use random forest, LURF). The LURF models outperformed LUR models, with increase in the average externally cross-validatedR2of 0.10-0.19. Using wavelet decomposition to separate short-lived events from the regional background, we also created time-decomposed LUR and LURF models. Compared to the standard model, this resulted in improvement inR2of up to 0.14. The time-decomposed models were more influenced by spatial parameters.

However, the dynamic nature of air quality makes PM2.5 forecasts at long horizons very challenging. This study proposed a novel machine learning-based model (MCNN-BP) that fused multiple convolutional neural networks (MCNN) with a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for making spatiotemporal PM2.5 forecasts for the next 72 h at 74 stations covering the whole Taiwan simultaneously. Model configuration involved an ensemble of massive hourly air quality and meteorological monitoring datasets and the existing publicly-available PM2.5 simulated (forecasted) datasets from an atmospheric chemical transport (ACT) model. The proposed methodology collaboratively constructed two CNNs to mine the observed data (the past) and the forecasted data from ACT (the future) separately. The results showed that the MCNN-BP model could significantly improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal PM2.5 forecasts and substantially reduce the forecast biases of the ACT model. We demonstrated that the proposed MCNN-BP model with effective feature extraction and good denoising ability could overcome the curse of dimensionality and offer satisfactory regional long-horizon PM2.5 forecasts. Moreover, the MCNN-BP model has considerably shorter computational time (5 min) and lower computational load than the compute-intensive ACT model. The proposed approach hits a milestone in multi-site and multi-horizon forecasting, which significantly contributes to early warning against regional air pollution.",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119348,21,11,Yes,STBPNN,,Yes,Taiwan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCN uses a supervisory random mechanism to assign its input weights and hidden biases, which makes it more stable than other randomized algorithms but also leads to time-consuming model training. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel bidirectional SCN algorithm (BSCN) in this paper, which divides the way of adding hidden nodes into two modes: forward learning and backward learning. In the forward learning mode, BSCN still uses the supervisory mechanism to configure the parameters of the newly added nodes, which is the same as SCN. In the backward learning mode, BSCN calculates the parameters at one time based on the residual error feedback of the current model. The two learning modes are performed iteratively until the prediction error of the model reaches an acceptable level or the number of hidden nodes reaches its maximum value. This semi-random learning mechanism greatly speeds up the training efficiency of the BSCN model and significantly improves the quality of the hidden nodes. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark regression problems, two real-life air pollution prediction problems, and a classical image processing problem show that BSCN can achieve faster training speed, higher stability, and better generalization ability than SCN.

A significant deterioration in air quality was experienced in Australia's most populous cities, Melbourne and Sydney, as a result of fires during the so-called Black Summer which ran from November 2019 through to February 2020. Following this period, social, mobility and economic restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic were implemented in Australia. We quantify the air quality impact of these contrasting periods in the south-eastern states of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) using a meteorological normalisation approach. A Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was used to compute baseline time seriesÂ of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide CO and particulate matter with diameter &lt; 2.5 ?m (PM2.5), based on a 19 year, detrended training dataset. Across Victorian sites, large increases in CO (188%), PM2.5 (322%) and ozone (22%) were observed over the RF prediction in January 2020. In NSW, smaller pollutant increases above the RF prediction were seen (CO 58%, PM2.5 80%, ozone 19%). This can be partly explained by the RF predictions being high compared to the mean of previous months, due to high temperatures and strong wind speeds, highlighting the importance of meteorological normalisation in attributing pollution changes to specific events. From the daily observation-RF prediction differences we estimated 249.8 (95% CI: 156.6Â343.) excess deaths and 3490.0 (95% CI 1325.9Â5653.5) additional hospitalisations were likely as a result of PM2.5 and O3 exposure in Victoria and NSW. During April 2019, when COVID-19 restrictions were in place, on average NO2 decreased by 21.5 and 8% in Victoria and NSW respectively. O3 and PM2.5 remained effectively unchanged in Victoria on average but increased by 20 and 24% in NSW respectively, supporting the suggestion that community mobility reduced more in Victoria than NSW. Overall the air quality change during the COVID-19 lockdown had a negligible impact on the calculated health outcomes.

Despite recent attempts to address this issue by imputing missing satellite AOD values, the uncertainty associated with the AOD imputation and its impacts on PM2.5 predictions have been understudied. To fill this gap, we developed a missing data imputation model for the AOD derived from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) and PM2.5 prediction models using several machine learning methods. We also examined how the uncertainty associated with the imputed AOD and a choice of machine learning algorithm were propagated to PM2.5 predictions. The application of the proposed imputation model to the data from New York State in the U.S. achieved a superior performance than those related studies, with a cross-validated R2 of 0.94 and a Root Mean Square Error of 0.017. We also found that there was considerable uncertainty in PM2.5 predictions associated with the use of imputed AOD values, although it was not as high as the uncertainty from the machine learning algorithms used in PM2.5 prediction models. We concluded that the quantification of uncertainties for both AOD imputation and its propagation to AOD-based PM2.5 prediction is necessary for accurate and reliable PM2.5 predictions.

In fact, exposure to Rn belongs to the most important causes for lung cancer after tobacco smoking. The dominant source of indoor Rn is the ground beneath the house. The geogenic Rn potential (GRP) - a function of soil gas Rn concentration and soil gas permeability - quantifies what Âearth delivers in terms of RnÂ and represents a hazard indicator for elevated indoor Rn concentration. In this study, we aim at developing an improved spatial continuous GRP map based on 4448 field measurements of GRP distributed across Germany. We fitted three different machine learning algorithms, multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forest and support vector machines utilizing 36 candidate predictors. Predictor selection, hyperparameter tuning and performance assessment were conducted using a spatial cross-validation where the data was iteratively left out by spatial blocks of 40 km*40 km. This procedure counteracts the effect of spatial auto-correlation in predictor and response data and minimizes dependence of training and test data. The spatial cross-validated performance statistics revealed that random forest provided the most accurate predictions. The predictors selected as informative reflect geology, climate (temperature, precipitation and soil moisture), soil hydraulic, soil physical (field capacity, coarse fraction) and soil chemical properties (potassium and nitrogen concentration). Model interpretation techniques such as predictor importance as well as partial and spatial dependence plots confirmed the hypothesized dominant effect of geology on GRP, but also revealed significant contributions of the other predictors. Partial and spatial dependence plots gave further valuable insight into the quantitative predictor-response relationship and its spatial distribution. A comparison with a previous version of the German GRP map using 1359 independent test data indicates a significantly better performance of the random forest based map.

Local emissions and urban structures can produce large spatial heterogeneities. We aim to improve the estimation of NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in 6 Italian metropolitan areas, using chemical-transport and machine learning models, and to assess the effect on population exposure by using information on urban population mobility. Three years (2013Â2015) of simulations were performed by the Chemical-Transport Model (CTM) FARM, at 1 km resolution, fed by boundary conditions provided by national-scale simulations, local emission inventories and meteorological fields. A downscaling of daily air pollutants at higher resolution (200 m) was then carried out by means of a machine learning Random-Forest (RF) model, considering CTM and spatial-temporal predictors, such as population, land-use, surface greenness and vehicular traffic, as input. RF achieved mean cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.59, 0.72, 0.76 and 0.75 for NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and O3, respectively, improving results from CTM alone. Mean concentration fields exhibited clear geographical gradients caused by climate conditions, local emission sources and photochemical processes. Time series of population weighted exposure (PWE) were estimated for two months of the year 2015 and for five cities, by combining population mobility data (derived from mobile phone traffic volumes data), and concentration levels from the RF model. PWE_RF metric better approximated the observed concentrations compared with the predictions from either CTM alone or CTM and RF combined, especially for pollutants exhibiting strong spatial gradients, such as NO2. 50% of the population was estimated to be exposed to NO2 concentrations between 12 and 38 ?g/m3 and PM10 between 20 and 35 ?g/m3.

These models were used to forecast hourly ozone concentrations of the following day for all of 2017 in the city of Seoul, South Korea. To prepare the training dataset, it was referred to observed meteorology and air pollution parameters of the 2014Â2016 period. The ensemble models fuse two regression models: a low-ozone peak model and a high-ozone model. For both, extremely randomized trees and deep neural networks were used. A regularization approach was also adopted that adjusts the model toward capturing higher ozone peaks by resampling the training dataset based on the peaks. Adopting the proposed ML ensemble forecasting method over single-model ML techniques as a part of mainstream practice for air quality forecasting will be beneficial for several reasons. For one, the proposed method, which captures daily maximum ozone concentrations during the high-ozone season (AprilÂSeptember), reduces the ozone peak prediction error by 5 to 30Â ppb. In addition, compared to station-specific (independent) ML models with more frequent low-ozone values, models are trained with a uniformly distributed dataset, so they are more generalizable in nature. As a result, unlike station-specific models, they retain their accuracy (yearly IOA = 0.84Â0.89) in all stations with an IOA increment. Proposed models also make predictions several times faster, requiring only one-time training for predicting an entire station network. Based on a categorical analysis of the training dataset, an algorithm was proposed for selecting the most suitable model for each month. The ÂbestÂ model further improves the accuracy of both the ML ensemble and individual models by up to 2.4%. This study shows that the ML ensemble modeling approach is a fast, reliable, and robust technique that can benefit environmental decision-makers in urban regions.

However, the accurate prediction by using this data is considered as challenging for machine learning methods. Deep Learning (DL) methods are widely used to process large amounts of data because they need less preprocessing than traditional machine learning methods. Various types of uncertainty associated with large amounts of raw data hinder the prediction accuracy. Belief Rule-Based Expert Systems (BRBES) are widely used to handle uncertain data. However, due to their incapability of integrating associative memory within the inference procedures, they demonstrate poor accuracy of prediction when large amounts of data is considered. Therefore, we propose the integration of an associative memory based DL method within the BRBES inference procedures, allowing to discover accurate data patterns and hence, the improvement of prediction under uncertainty. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, which is named BRB-DL, it has been fine tuned against two datasets, one in the area of air pollution and the other in the area of power generation. The reliability of the proposed BRB-DL method, has also been compared with other DL methods such as Long-Short Term Memory and Deep Neural Network, and BRBES by taking into account of the air quality dataset from Beijing city and the power generation dataset of a combined cycle power plant.

During the past decade, many optimization algorithms have been designed to achieve the optimal usage of existing roadway capacity in cities to leverage the problem. However, it is still a challenging task for the vehicles to interact with the complex city environment in a real time manner. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to build a real-time intelligent vehicle routing and navigation system by formulating the task as a sequence of decisions. In addition, an integrated framework is provided to facilitate the intelligent vehicle navigation research by embedding smart agents into the SUMO simulator. Nine realistic traffic scenarios are simulated to test the proposed navigation method. The experimental results have demonstrated the efficient convergence of the vehicle navigation agents and their effectiveness to make optimal decisions under the volatile traffic conditions. The results also show that the proposed method provides a better navigation solution comparing to the benchmark routing optimization algorithms. The performance has been further validated by using the Wilcoxon test.

Although the health risk due to O-3 pollution has been widely evaluated, the spatiotemporal variation of O-3 level and its potential health impact in a remote tropical island was less concerned. In the present study, we firstly employed an efficient machine learning model named random forest (RF) to fill the missing O-3 column amount over Hainan Island of China based on the meteorological factors and other geographical covariates. The result suggested that the RF model achieved the best performance (R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 6.36 DU) among all of the filling methods. We further used an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to estimate the surface O-3 level around Hainan Island on the basis of the full-coverage O-3 column amount and other predictors. The XGBoost method showed the better predictive performance (R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 24.14 mu g/m(3)) compared with other estimation models. The predicted 0 3 concentration exhibited remarkably spatial difference with the highest value observed in Dongfang (77.61 +/- 5.25 mu g/m(3)), followed by that in Changjiang (72.51 +/- 5.22 ttg/m 3 ), and the lowest one in Lingshui (64.16 2.71 mu g/m(3)). Based on the estimated O-3 level, we found that the annually mean nonattainment days in Dongfang reached 29.26 +/- 35.20 days and about one third of days in the winter fell into the severe O-3 pollution over Hainan Island. Besides, the mean all-cause mortalities owing to severe O-3 pollution over Hainan Island were calculated to be 391 (95%CI: (212-570)) cases each year, accounting for 0.004% of all the population in Hainan Island. The statistical simulation of O-3 level at a remote island updated the traditional knowledge and aroused the public concern on island air pollution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

One such critically needed solution is the prediction of health-relevant ambient ground-level air pollution concentrations. However, many challenges exist surrounding the size and representativeness of limited ground reference stations for model development, reconciling multi-source data, and interpretability of deep learning models. This research addresses these challenges by leveraging a strategically deployed, extensive low-cost sensor (LCS) network that was rigorously calibrated through an optimized neural network. A set of raster predictors with varying data quality and spatial scales was retrieved and processed, including gap-filled satellite aerosol optical depth products and airborne LiDAR-derived 3D urban form. We developed a multi-scale, attention-enhanced convolutional neural network model to reconcile the LCS measurements and multi-source predictors for estimating daily PM2.5 concentration at 30-m resolution. This model employs an advanced approach by using the geostatistical kriging method to generate a baseline pollution pattern and a multi-scale residual method to identify both regional patterns and localized events for high-frequency feature retention. We further used permutation tests to quantify the feature importance, which has rarely been done in DL applications in environmental science. Finally, we demonstrated one application of the model by investigating the air pollution inequality issue across and within various urbanization levels at the block group scale. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of geospatial AI analysis to provide actionable solutions for addressing critical environmental issues. © 2023 The Authors",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121832,11,11,Yes,CNN,,Yes,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has led to an increase in congestion control difficulties, which directly affect citizens through air pollution, fuel consumption, traffic law breaches, noise pollution, accidents, and loss of time. Traffic prediction is an essential aspect of an intelligent transportation system in smart cities because it helps reduce overall traffic congestion. This article aims to design and enforce a traffic prediction scheme that is efficient and accurate in forecasting traffic flow. Available traffic flow prediction methods are still unsuitable for real-world applications. This fact motivated us to work on a traffic flow forecasting issue using Vision Transformers (VTs). In this work, VTs were used in conjunction with Convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict traffic congestion in urban spaces on a city-wide scale. In our proposed architecture, a traffic image is fed to a CNN, which generates feature maps. These feature maps are then fed to the VT, which employs the dual techniques of tokenization and projection. Tokenization is used to convert features into tokens containing Vision information, which are then sent to projection, where they are transformed into feature maps and ultimately delivered to LSTM. The experimental results demonstrate that the vision transformer prediction method based on Spatio-temporal characteristics is an excellent way of predicting traffic flow, particularly during anomalous traffic situations. The proposed technology surpasses traditional methods in terms of precision, accuracy and recall and aids in energy conservation. Through rerouting, the proposed work will benefit travellers and reduce fuel use. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,10.1109/tits.2022.3233801,11,11,No,,,,"India,Canada,Taiwan,Lebanon,Poland,Norway,Australia,United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this important source of data suffers from low temporal resolution. Recently, geostationary satellites provide AOD data in high temporal and spatial resolution. However, the feasibility of these data in PM2.5 prediction needs further study. In this paper, we analyzed the impact of AOD derived from Himawari-8 in PM2.5 predictions. Moreover, by combining wavelet, machine learning techniques, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), a novel hybrid model was proposed. The results showed that AOD missing rate over Yangtze River Delta region is the highest in Nanjing, Hefei, and Maanshan. In addition, missing rates are the lowest in winter and summer (∼80%). Moreover, we found that considering AOD, as an auxiliary variable in the model, could not improve the accuracy of PM2.5 predictions, and in some cases decreased it slightly. In comparison with other models, our proposed hybrid model showed higher prediction accuracy, R2 is improved by 11.64% on average, and root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error is reduced by 26.82%, 27.24%, and 29.88% respectively.

The air quality in Liaocheng during lockdown and after lockdown periods in 2020 was obviously improved compared with the same periods of 2019. The ANN employed in the study contains a hidden layer with 6 neurons, an input layer with 11 parameters, and an output layer. First, the ANN is used with 80% of data for training, then with 10% of data for verification. The value of correlation coefficient (R) for the training and validation data is 0.9472 and 0.9834, respectively. In the forecast period, it is demonstrated that the ANN model with Bayesian regularization (BR) algorithm (trainbr) obtained the best forecasting performance in terms of R (0.9570), mean absolute error (4.6 ?g/m3), and root mean square error (6.6 ?g/m3), respectively. The ANN model has produced accurate results. These results prove that the ANN is effective in monthly PM2.5 concentration predicting due to the fact that it can identify nonlinear relationships between the input and output variables.

The sensor array was evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA) and neural network-based classification in terms of the gas sensor data type/amount, neural network algorithms, sensor combinations, and environmental factors. The PCA analyses indicated the limitations on the discrimination of VOCs under temperature- and/or humidity-interfered gas sensing environments. Gas detection/discrimination could be improved significantly by using three supervised algorithms, i.e., artificial neural networks (ANNs), deep neural networks (DNNs), and 1-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs). The neural network algorithm prediction based on the entire gas sensing/purge transient data outperforms deep learning-assisted predictions based on partial gas sensing transients. Compared to 1D CNNs, DNNs are more appropriate in terms of training/validation/test datasets. The effects due to humidity variation are more significant than those due to temperature fluctuation. A 2-sensor mode combination can be exploited to replace the 5-sensor operation in ML-based applications. The indoor pollutants can be successfully discriminated even under the variation of ambient humidity and temperature by ML-based approaches.

One of the essential approaches to managing and planning for GHG emissions reduction is an accurate prediction. This study has presented a hybrid machine learning and mathematical programming approach that enjoys a high prediction accuracy and is implemented with small data to predict the emission of greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O, CH4, and Fluorinated-Gas). Data in the energy sector affecting GHG emissions and also related data to the rates of GHG emissions from 1990 to 2018 in Iran have been collected. Then, the forecast of emission of each gas has been performed by nine algorithms of ANN, AR, ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, RF, SVR, KNN, and LSTM. The forecast accuracy of each algorithm has been evaluated with five indicators. The results of GHG emissions till 2028 have been forecasted and presented with algorithms with higher forecast accuracy. In the next step, the outcomes of the machine learning algorithms have been regarded as the input data to the mathematical model, which has been then implemented by the PSO and GWO metaheuristic algorithms, and the emission of greenhouse gases has been predicted until the year 2028. The prediction accuracy of the proposed approach has been evaluated by five indices and compared with the results of machine learning algorithms. Finally, the Stepwise Regression algorithm has been applied to evaluate the relationships between the data. In general, the results obtained from this study indicated an increase in forecast accuracy using an optimization model. This optimization model has increased the forecast accuracy compared to the machine learning algorithms applied in this study. The improvements were at least 31.7% with the PSO algorithm and 12.8% with the GWO algorithm. Based on the high-accurate prediction of the proposed approach, the emission of greenhouses gases in Iran will exceed 1096 Mt/year in 2028.

The globe-wide urban surface O3are climbing by 1.9Â±2.3 ppbV per decade, except for the decreasing trends in eastern United States. On the other hand, the global rural surface O3tend to be relatively stable, except for the rising tendencies in China and India.

Accurate PM2.5 predictions are significant to environmental management and human health. Recently, deep learning has received increasing attention from relevant researchers. In this work, a spatiotemporal causal convolutional neural network (ST-CausalConvNet) for short-term PM2.5 prediction is proposed. The distinguishing characteristics of the proposed model is that the convolutions in the model architecture are causal, where an output at a certain time step is convolved only with elements from the same or earlier time steps in the previous layer. Accordingly, no information leakage is induced from the future to the past in this model. The spatial dependence between multiple monitoring stations was also considered in the model. Spatiotemporal correlation analysis was performed to select relevant information from monitoring stations that have a high relationship with the target station. The information from the target and related stations were then employed as the inputs and fed into the model. A case study from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2015 in Beijing, China was conducted. The next hour PM2.5 concentration was predicted by the proposed model by using historical air quality and meteorological data from 36 monitoring stations. Experimental results show that the trends of the predicted PM2.5 concentrations and the observed values were consistent. The proposed method achieved a better prediction performance than the other three comparative models, namely artificial neural network (ANN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM).

However, it can be difficult to optimize the indoor environments by previous approaches in a macroscopic system such as a building in which various physical factors interact according to operating HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning). According to these reasons, an innovative integrated prediction and control solution of the building environment is required. This study aimed at developing an integrated model based on artificial neural network (ANN) in a school building, which predicts predicted mean vote (PMV) and concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter 10 ?m (PM10), and particulate matter 2.5 ?m (PM2.5) after one cycle using current input variables. This model can be developed with training that prevents spurious regression while taking the advantage of supervised learning. In addition, it can overcome the limitations of existing machine learning models and, has utility in predicting the integrated environment of buildings. To achieve this goal, first, the structure of the integrated neural network was designed, and data acquisition was conducted according to the simulation of the target building. Second, the number of hidden layers was searched, which is suitable for predicting each target, by developing initial prediction models. Third, an optimal model was developed using multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). Particularly, the proposed method divides the internal structure of a neural network into independent and detailed prediction models, and it can prevent spurious regression by excluding irrelevant input variables in predicting each target variable. As the accuracy analysis of the optimal prediction model, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the predicted data and observed data are as follows: (1) 0.2243 for PMV, (2) 0.8816 for CO2, (3) 0.4645 for PM10, (4) and 0.6646 for PM2.5. Therefore, it was concluded that the proposed model has high accuracy and applicability for building integrated control. Also, this model will be applied to the optimal integrated control of indoor environments and HVAC energy.

To achieve the desired higher accuracy, proposed OccupancySense model detects human presence and predicts indoor occupancy count by the fusion of Internet of Things (IoT) based indoor air quality (IAQ) data along with static and dynamic context data which is a unique approach in this domain. This data fusion helps us to achieve higher forecasting accuracy along with the integration of state of the art gradient boosting based categorical features supported CatBoost algorithm. For comparison, other commonly used machine learning classification and regression algorithms, e.g., Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for regression and Logistic Regression (LR), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification, were also assessed during this experiment. Out of these, CatBoost outperformed other models when considered in terms of accuracy. Hence, CatBoost is used as the core of the OccupancySense design and we have validated the proposed model by a real-world case study with continuous 91 days of indoor data, having 33 unique external features. These features are collected directly as well as derived from the collected data. To handle these features, feature engineering plays a key role in the OccupancySense model. The speciality of this model is, it is non-intrusive one but have high predictive power. It can detect occupancy and predicts headcount along with occupancy density of the room pretty accurately with 99.85%, 93.2% and 95.6% respectively (with 10 fold cross-validation) which outperforms other state of the art models.

Effective prediction models can help reduce the adverse effects of air pollutants. Accurate predictions of air pollutant concentration can provide a scientific basis for air pollution prevention and control. However, the previous air pollution-related prediction models mainly processed air quality prediction, or the prediction of a single or two air pollutants. Meanwhile, the temporal and spatial characteristics and multiple factors of pollutants were not fully considered. Herein, we establish a deep learning model for an atmospheric pollutant memory network (LSTM) by both applying the one-dimensional multi-scale convolution kernel (ODMSCNN) and a long-short-term memory network (LSTM) on the basis of temporal and spatial characteristics. The temporal and spatial characteristics combine the respective advantages of CNN and LSTM networks. First, ODMSCNN is utilized to extract the temporal and spatial characteristics of air pollutant-related data to form a feature vector, and then the feature vector is input into the LSTM network to predict the concentration of air pollutants. The data set comes from the daily concentration data and hourly concentration data of six atmospheric pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, SO2 ) and 17 types of meteorological data in XiÂan. Daily concentration data prediction, hourly concentration data prediction, group data prediction and multi-factor prediction were used to verify the effectiveness of the model.

We also use remote-sensing satellite imagery of various atmospheric pollutant matters. We utilize government maintained ground-based PM2.5 sensor data along with remote sensing satellite imagery using a ConvLSTM to predict PM2.5 over the greater Los Angeles county area roughly 10 days in the future using 10 days of data from the past in 46-h increments. Our error results on the PM2.5 predictions over time and along each sensor location show significant improvement over existing research in the field utilizing spatiotemporal deep predictive algorithms.

Numerous studies have characterized built environment physical features and environmental exposures, but few have examined urban perceptions at geographic scales needed for population-based research. The degree to which urban perceptions are associated with different environmental features, and traditional environmental exposures such as air pollution or urban green space, is largely unknown. Objective: To determine built environment factors associated with safety, lively and beauty perceptions across 56 cities. Methods: We examined perceptions collected in the open source Place Pulse 2.0 dataset, which assigned safety, lively and beauty scores to street view images based on crowd-sourced labelling. We derived built environment measures for the locations of these images (110,000 locations across 56 global cities) using GIS and remote sensing datasets as well as street view imagery features (e.g. trees, cars) using deep learning image segmentation. Linear regression models were developed using Lasso penalized variable selection to predict perceptions based on visible (street level images) and GIS/remote sensing built environment variables. Results: Population density, impervious surface area, major roads, traffic air pollution, tree cover and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed statistically significant differences between high and low safety, lively, and beauty perception locations. Visible street level features explained approximately 18% of the variation in safety, lively, and beauty perceptions, compared to 3Â10% explained by GIS/remote sensing. Large differences in prediction were seen when modelling between city (R2 67Â81%) versus within city (R2 11Â13%) perceptions. Important predictor variables included visible accessibility features (e.g. streetlights, benches) and roads for safety, visible plants and buildings for lively, and visible green space and NDVI for beauty. Conclusion: Substantial within and between city differences in built environment perceptions exist, which visible street level features and GIS/remote sensing variables only partly explain. This offers a new research avenue to expand built environment measurement methods to include perceptions in addition to physical features.

Current studies in China at the national scale were less focused on NO2 exposure and consequent health effects than fine particulate exposure, mainly due to a lack of high-quality exposure models for accurate NO2 predictions over a long period. We developed an advanced modeling framework that incorporated multisource, high-quality predictor data (e.g., satellite observations [Ozone Monitoring Instrument NO2, TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument NO2, and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction aerosol optical depth], chemical transport model simulations, high-resolution geographical variables) and three independent machine learning algorithms into an ensemble model. The model contains three stages: (1) filling missing satellite data; (2) building an ensemble model and predicting daily NO2 concentrations from 2013 to 2019 across China at 1Ã1 km2 resolution; (3) downscaling the predictions to finer resolution (100 m) at the urban scale. Our model achieves a high performance in terms of cross-validation to assess the agreement of the overall (R2 = 0.72) and the spatial (R2 = 0.85) variations of the NO2 predictions over the observations. The model performance remains moderately good when the predictions are extrapolated to the previous years without any monitoring data (CV R2 &gt; 0.68) or regions far away from monitors (CV R2 &gt; 0.63). We identified a clear decreasing trend of NO2 exposure from 2013 to 2019 across the country with the largest reduction in suburban and rural areas. Our downscaled model further improved the prediction ability by 4%Â14% in some megacities and captured substantial NO2 variations within 1-km grids in the urban areas, especially near major roads. Our model provides flexibility at both temporal and spatial scales and can be applied to exposure assessment and epidemiological studies with various study domains (e.g., national or citywide) and settings (e.g., long-term and short-term).

Since 2012, they have been added to the pollutant list for national monitoring in Wuhan. However, the fine-scale variation in pollution, especially at the street level, is complex and requires further exploration. In this study, the influence of urban form on the street-level air pollution distribution was comprehensively assessed according to the urban factors, high-resolution meteorological data, PM2.5 and CO concentration data collected via mobile monitoring along roads in Wuhan. Furthermore, potential urban factors, including the land-use and urban form characteristics, were obtained from geographic information system. Both linear regression and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models were developed to explore the relationship between the observed concentrations and the predictor variables. The modeling results demonstrate that the GBDT model, which captured the non-linear relationship, helps to better explain more of the variations in the pollutant concentrations than the linear model. This study provides insights into machine learning models for pollution prediction and demonstrate the important relationship between urban form and street-level pollutants. The results suggest that the urban form of the podium-level porosity can be set higher than 0.7 to promote the ventilation of street-level PM2.5 and CO, building density can be less than 0.35, and the standard deviation of height can be set to ~10 m in central Wuhan to mitigate street-level PM2.5. Thus, quantitatively demonstrating the impact of urban form on the PM2.5 and CO concentrations can help decision-makers with urban planning and management.

Since the time series data analysis is desired for the COVID-19 time-dependent frequent waves, here in this manuscript, we have developed a time series model with the aid of Ânonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX)Â approach. The distribution of infectious agent-containing droplets from an infected person to an uninfected person is a common form of respiratory disease transmission. SARS-CoV-2 has mainly spread via short-range respiratory droplet transmission. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to have occurred over long distances or times in unusual conditions; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in PM10 collected in Italy. This research shows that SARS-CoV-2 particles adsorbed to outdoor PM remained viable for a long time, given the epidemiology of COVID-19, outdoor air pollution is unlikely to be a significant route of transmission. In this research, ANN time series is used to analyze the data resulting from the COVID-19 first and second waves and the forecasted results show that air pollution affects people in different areas of Italy and make more people sick with covid-19.

The data include indoor/outdoor PM2.5 concentration, environmental parameters and time of day. By comparing three different input strategies, we found that a strategy employing historical PM2.5 and time of day as inputs performed best. With this strategy, the model can be applied to predict the relatively stable trend of indoor PM2.5 concentration in advance. When the input length is 2Â h and the prediction horizon is 30Â min, the median prediction error is 8.3Â Âµg/m3 for the whole test set.

The new geostationary meteorological satellite of China, Fengyun-4A (FY-4A), provides a unique opportunity to fill this gap. In this study, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was applied to retrieve hourly PM2.5 of China directly from FY-4A Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data.

A new insight into the association of PM1 and PM2.5 with children's lung function,Children; China; Lung function; PM1,"Experimental data suggests that PM1 is more toxic than PM2.5 although the epidemiologic evidence suggests that the health associations are similar. However, few objective exposure data are available to compare the associations of PM1 and PM2.5 with children lung function. Our objectives are a) to evaluate associations between long-term exposure to PM1, PM2.5 and children's lung function, and b) to compare the associations between PM1 and PM2.5. From 2012 to 2013, we enrolled 6,740 children (7Â14 years), randomly recruited from primary and middle schools located in seven cities in northeast China. We measured lung function including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) utilizing two portable electronic spirometers. We dichotomized continuous lung function measures according the expected values for gender and age. The spatial resolution at which PM1 and PM2.5 estimated were estimated using a machine learning method and the temporal average concentrations were averaged from 2009 to 2012. A multilevel regression model was used to estimate the associations of PM1, PM2.5 exposure and lung function measures, adjusted for confounding factors. Associations with lower lung function were consistently larger for PM1 than for PM2.5. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) per interquartile range greater PM1 ranged from 1.53 for MMEF (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20Â1.96) to 2.14 for FEV1 (95% CI: 1.66Â2.76) and ORs for PM2.5 ranged from 1.36 for MMEF (95%CI: 1.12Â1.66) to 1.82 for FEV1 (95%CI: 1.49Â2.22), respectively. PM1 and PM2.5 had significant associations with FVC and FEV1 in primary school children, and on PEF and MMEF in middle school children. Long-term PM1 and PM2.5 exposure can lead to decreased lung function in children, and the associations of PM1 are stronger than PM2.5. Therefore, PM1 may be more hazardous to children's respiratory health than PM2.5 exposure.

Some studies suggest that small air particles facilitate the spread of viruses and also of the new coronavirus, besides the direct person-to-person contagion. However, the effects of the exposure to particulate matter and other contaminants on SARS-CoV-2 has been poorly explored. Here we examined the possible reasons why the new coronavirus differently impacted on Italian regional and provincial populations. With the help of artificial intelligence, we studied the importance of air pollution for mortality and positivity rates of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy. We discovered that among several environmental, health, and socio-economic factors, air pollution and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as its main component, resulted as the most important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 effects. We also found that the emissions from industries, farms, and road traffic - in order of importance - might be responsible for more than 70% of the deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 nationwide. Given the major contribution played by air pollution (much more important than other health and socio-economic factors, as we discovered), we projected that, with an increase of 5Â10% in air pollution, similar future pathogens may inflate the epidemic toll of Italy by 21Â32% additional cases, whose 19Â28% more positives and 4Â14% more deaths. Our findings, demonstrating that fine-particulate (PM2.5) pollutant level is the most important factor to predict SARS-CoV-2 effects that would worsen even with a slight decrease of air quality, highlight that the imperative of productivity before health and environmental protection is, indeed, a short-term/small-minded resolution.

In order to predict air quality, there were many studies that exploited various machine learning techniques to build predictive model for pollutant concentration or air quality prediction. However, enhancing the prediction performance always is the common problem of existing studies. Traditional templates based on machine learning and deep learning methods, such as GBTR (gradient boosted tree regression), SVR (support vector machine-based regression), and LSTM (long short-term memory), are most promising approaches to address these problems. Some previous researches showed that ensemble learning technology can improve predictive performance of other domains. In order to improve the accuracy of forecasting, in this paper, we propose a hybrid model and framework to improve the forecasting accuracy of air pollution.

In this study, we apply machine learning techniques to a dataset of 70 diesel vehicles tested in real-world driving conditions to: (i) cluster vehicles with similar emissions performance, and (ii) model instantaneous emissions. The application of dynamic time warping and clustering analysis by NOx emissions resulted in 17 clusters capturing 88% of trips in the dataset. We show that clustering effectively groups vehicles with similar emissions profiles, however no significant correlation between emissions and vehicle characteristics (i.e. engine size, vehicle weight) were found. For each cluster, we evaluate three instantaneous emissions models: a look-up table (LT) approach, a non-linear regression (NLR) model and a neural network multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model. The NLR model provides accurate instantaneous NOx predictions, on par with the MLP: relative errors in prediction of emission factors are below 20% for both models, average fractional biases are ?0.01 (s.d. 0.02) and ?0.0003 (s.d. 0.04), and average normalised mean squared errors are 0.25 (s.d. 0.14) and 0.29 (s.d. 0.16), for the NLR and MLP models respectively. However, neural networks are better able to deal with vehicles not belonging to a specific cluster. The new models that we present rely on simple inputs of vehicle speed and acceleration, which could be extracted from existing sources including traffic cameras and vehicle tracking devices, and can therefore be deployed immediately to enable fast and accurate prediction of vehicle NOx emissions. The speed and the ease of use of these new models make them an ideal operational tool for policy makers aiming to build emission inventories or evaluate emissions mitigation strategies.

This study proposes a three-stage hybrid neural network model to forecast outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. It subsumes outlier correction, decomposition, neural network, and metaheuristic optimization to guarantee high accuracy. The adopted methods serve different purposes and ultimately aim at improving the performance of model. Firstly, a robust outlier correction preprocessing method is employed to filter the abnormal information in the original PM2.5 concentrations series and reduce its complexity. Then, the processed series is adaptively decomposed into several subseries by empirical wavelet transform. The subseries are more stationary and their trends are more obvious than original series. To forecast each subseries and generate multi-step forecasting outputs, weighted regularized extreme learning machine whose parameters are optimally determined by neural network algorithm is used. Finally, inverse empirical wavelet transform is implemented to reconstruct the subseries and correct unexpected forecasting values beyond the frequency bands. The proposed model is tested by the actual data collected from four cities in China. Results demonstrate that: (1) the proposed model has accurate forecasting performance, whose root mean square errors of 5-step daily forecasting results in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan are 4.7555?g/m3, 3.3024?g/m3, 6.4326?g/m3, and 4.3191?g/m3, respectively; (2) all components of the hybrid model are indispensable to promote accuracy; (3) the proposed model significantly outperforms seven benchmark models and five existing models; (4) the forecasting results can be utilized to analyze the trend of pollution and perform better management measures.

Forecasting a future outbreak with particulate pollution and machine learning,Air pollution; COVID-19; Emilia-Romagna; Italy; Machine learning models; Predictions; Second wave,"The Nobel laureate Niels Bohr once said that: ""Predictions are very difficult, especially if they are about the future"". Nonetheless, models that can forecast future COVID-19 outbreaks are receiving special attention by policymakers and health authorities, with the aim of putting in place control measures before the infections begin to increase. Nonetheless, two main problems emerge. First, there is no a general agreement on which kind of data should be registered for judging on the resurgence of the virus (e.g., infections, deaths, percentage of hospitalizations, reports from clinicians, signals from social media). Not only this, but all these data also suffer from common defects, linked to their reporting delays and to the uncertainties in the collection process. Second, the complex nature of COVID-19 outbreaks makes it difficult to understand if traditional epidemiological models, such as susceptible, infectious, or recovered (SIR), are more effective for a timely prediction of an outbreak than alternative computational models. Well aware of the complexity of this forecasting problem, we propose here an innovative metric for predicting COVID-19 diffusion based on the hypothesis that a relation exists between the spread of the virus and the presence in the air of particulate pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10, and NO2. Drawing on the recent assumption of 239 experts who claimed that this virus can be airborne, and further considering that particulate matter may favor this airborne route, we developed a machine learning (ML) model that has been instructed with: (i) all the COVID-19 infections that occurred in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, one of the most polluted areas in Europe, in the period of February-July 2020, (ii) the daily values of all the particulates taken in the same period and in the same region, and finally (iii) the chronology according to which restrictions were imposed by the Italian Government to human activities. Our ML model was then subjected to a classic ten-fold cross-validation procedure that returned a promising 90% accuracy value. Finally, the model was used to predict a possible resurgence of the virus in all the nine provinces of Emilia-Romagna, in the period of September-December 2020. To make those predictions, input to our ML model were the daily measurements of the aforementioned pollutants registered in the periods of September-December 2017/2018/2019, along with the hypothesis that the mild containment measures taken in Italy in the so-called Phase 3 are obeyed. At the time we write this article, we cannot have a confirmation of the precision of our predictions. Nevertheless, we are projecting a scenario based on an original hypothesis that makes our COVID-19 prediction model unique in the world. Its accuracy will be soon judged by history-and this, too, is science at the service of society.

Forty-seven healthy college students were recruited, and their exhaled breath samples (n = 235) were collected and analyzed for VOCs before, on, and after two separate haze pollution episodes using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). Using a paired t-test and machine learning model (Gradient Boosting Machine, GBM), six exhaled VOC species including propanol and isoprene were revealed to differ significantly among pre-, on-, and post-exposure in both haze episodes, while none was found between clean control days. The GBM model was shown capable of differentiating between pre- and on-exposure to haze pollution with a precision of 90-100% for both haze episodes. However, poor performance was detected for the same model between two different clean days. In addition to gender and particular haze occurrence influences, correlation analysis revealed that NH4+, NO3-, acetic acid, mesylate, CO, NO2, PM2.5, and O-3 played important roles in the changes in breath-borne VOC fingerprints following haze air pollution exposure.

In this context, the development of systems for monitoring, forecasting, and controlling emissions plays an important role. The literature about forecasting systems based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) ensembles has been highlighted regarding statistical accuracy and efficiency. In this article, trainable and non-trainable combination methods are used for PM10 and PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 and 2.5 micrometers, respectively) time series forecasting for eight different locations, in Finland and Brazil, for different periods. Trainable ensembles based on ANNs, linear regression, and Copulas are compared with non-trainable combinations (mean and median), single ANNs, and linear statistical approaches.

To account for potential confounding, I assemble a dataset that includes 50 county-level factors that are potentially related to residential segregation and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. These factors are grouped into eight categories: demographics, density and potential for public interaction, social capital, health risk factors, capacity of the health care system, air pollution, employment in essential businesses, and political views. I use double-lasso regression, a machine learning method for model selection and inference, to select the most important controls in a statistically principled manner. Counties that are 1 SD above the racial segregation mean have experienced mortality and infection rates that are 8% and 5% higher than the mean. These differences represent an average of four additional deaths and 105 additional infections for each 100,000 residents in the county.

Existing O3 datasets with coarse spatiotemporal resolution and limited coverage, and the un-certainties of O3 influential factors seriously restrain related epidemiology and air pollution studies. To tackle above issues, we proposed a novel scheme to estimate daily O3 concentrations on a fine grid scale (1 km x 1 km) from 2018 to 2020 across China based on machine learning methods using hourly observed ground-level pollutant concentrations data, meteorological data, satellite data, and auxiliary data including digital eleva-tion model (DEM), land use data (LUD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population (POP), and nighttime light images (NTL), and to identify the difference of influential factors of O3 on diverse urbanization and topography conditions. Some findings were achieved. The correlation coefficients (R2) between O3 con-centrations and surface net solar radiation (SNSR), boundary layer height (BLH), 2 m temperature (T2M), 10 m v -component (MVW), and NDVI were 0.80, 0.40, 0.35, 0.30, and 0.20, respectively.

Our model outperforms other baseline models. Results show that incorporating Bayesian and domain-specific knowledge into the deep learning model can reduce the prediction errors by a maximum of 3.7% and 12.4%, for Beijing and London, respectively. Specifically, incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the Bayesian deep-learning model reduces prediction errors whilst the integration of Bayesian techniques allows the fusion of different forecast strategies to improve prediction accuracy.

However, statistical-based models oversimplify the AOD-PM2.5 relationships, whereas complex machine learning technologies ignore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the predictors and demonstrate shortage in interpretation. Besides, large AOD data gaps resulting in PM2.5 estimation biases have been seldom imputed in previous studies, especially at national scales. To fill the above research gaps, this study attempts to present a feasible methodology to estimate daily spatially-continuous PM2.5 concentrations in China. The AOD data gaps across China were first imputed via a random forest (RF) model. Then, an interpretable self-adaptive deep neural network (SADNN) model, incorporating AOD, meteorological and other auxiliary predictors, was developed to estimate daily spatially-continuous PM2.5 concentrations from 2017 to 2018. Five-fold sample (site)-based cross-validation results showed a high accuracy of the SADNN model, with coefficient of determination and root mean square error values equal to 0.86 (0.84) and 13.07 (14.30) ?g/m3, respectively, outperforming the standard DNN and the RF model. Furthermore, the SADNN model identified the spatiotemporal patterns of predictor importance, and demonstrated that the boundary layer height, elevation and AOD were the most important predictors both spatially and temporally. And the predictor importance in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was different from that in the rest of China. These results enhance our understanding of AOD-PM2.5 relationships and elucidate the estimated PM2.5 datasets with complete coverage are applicable for related air pollution studies and epidemiological cohort studies.

Data from satellites, reanalysis, and chemical transport models offer additional information used to reconstruct pollution concentrations at high spatio-temporal resolutions. This study aims to develop a multi-stage satellite-based machine learning model to estimate daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels across Great Britain between 2008Â2018. This high-resolution model consists of random forest (RF) algorithms applied in four stages. Stage-1 augments monitor-PM2.5 series using co-located PM10 measures. Stage-2 imputes missing satellite aerosol optical depth observations using atmospheric reanalysis models. Stage-3 integrates the output from previous stages with spatial and spatio-temporal variables to build a prediction model for PM2.5 . Stage-4 applies Stage-3 models to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations over a 1 km grid. The RF architecture performed well in all stages, with results from Stage-3 showing an average cross-validated R2 of 0.767 and minimal bias. The model performed better over the temporal scale when compared to the spatial component, but both presented good accuracy with an R2 of 0.795 and 0.658, respectively. These findings indicate that direct satellite observations must be integrated with other satellite-based products and geospatial variables to derive reliable estimates of air pollution exposure. The high spatio-temporal resolution and the relatively high precision allow these estimates (approximately 950 million points) to be used in epidemiological analyses to assess health risks associated with both short-and long-term exposure to PM2.5 .

Numerous studies have demonstrated that data-driven spatio-temporal prediction models of PM2.5 concentration are comparable with the model-driven model. However, data-driven models are usually depending on the statistical correlation between PM2.5 and other factors and have challenges in dealing with causality in complex systems. In this paper, we argue that domain knowledge should be incorporated into data-driven models to enhance prediction accuracy and make the model more physically realistic. We focus on the influence of dynamic wind-field on PM2.5 concentration distribution and fuse the pollution diffusion distance with the deep learning model based on a wind-field surface. In order to model spatial dependence between monitoring stations, which is dynamic and anisotropic because of the wind-field, we proposed a hybrid deep learning framework, dynamic directed spatio-temporal graph convolution networks (DD-STGCN). It expanded the ability to deal with space-time prediction in the continuous and dynamic wind-field. We used a directed graph time-series to describe the vertex state and topological relationship between vertices and replaced traditional Euclidean distance with wind-field diffusion distance to describe the proximity relationship between vertices. Our experiment results demonstrated that the DD-STGCN model achieved a better prediction ability than LSTM, GC-LSTM, and STGCN models. Compared to the best comparison model, MAPE, MAE, and RMSE were improved by 10.2%, 9.7%, and 9.6% in 12 h on an average, respectively.

To obtain the spatial distributions of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an in summer and develop a simultaneous control strategy of ozone and urban heat island, the land use regression model is modified and improved using the machine learning random forest algorithm. The LUR-Kriging-RF integrated prediction model is then established. The land use regression and kriging are used to extract the feature variables, while random forest is used to establish a regression model. The spatial distribution maps of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an are obtained by regression mapping of the prediction model, and the spatial relationships between them are analyzed. The SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) and partial dependence plot (PDP) are adopted to explain the way feature variables act on ozone and urban heat island. Based on the spatial distribution and interaction mode, a simultaneous control strategy of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an is put forward. For ozone, the R2 of the integrated prediction model (0.65) is higher than that of land use regression (0.4), while the RMSE (28.18) of the integrated model is lower than that of land use regression (35.66). For temperature, the R2 of the integrated model (0.93) is higher than that of land use regression (0.8), while its RMSE (0.92) is lower than that of land use regression (1.52).

The suitable strategies for mapping ozone pollution and urban heat island control include reducing VOCs emissions from industrial sources and agricultural sources, increasing plants with low VOCs emissions, and spray humidification. This study can be used to evaluate ozone exposure and thermal exposure, provide scientific support for environmental protection and urban heat island control policies, contribute to reducing public health threats, promote the sustainability of urban environments, and promote the practical application of machine learning in this field.

Here, we use a random forest model, a machine learning (ML) approach, combined with a de-weather method to analyze the PM2.5 level during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei Province. The results show that changes in anthropogenic emissions have reduced PM2.5 concentrations in February and March 2020 by about 33.3% compared to the same period in 2019, while changes in meteorological conditions have increased PM2.5 concentrations by about 8.8%. Moreover, the impact of meteorological conditions is more significant in the central region, which is likely to be related to regional transport. After excluding the contribution of meteorological conditions, the PM2.5 concentration in Hubei Province in February and March 2020 is lower than the secondary standard of China (35 ? g/m3). Our estimates also indicate that under similar meteorological conditions as in February and March 2019, an emission reduction intensity equivalent to about 48% of the emission reduction intensity during the lockdown may bring the annual average PM2.5 concentration to the standard (35 ? g/m3). Our study shows that machine learning is a powerful tool to quantify the influencing factors of PM2.5, and the results further emphasize the need for scientific emission reduction as well as joint regional control measures in future.

This is generally due to a lack of air quality monitoring networks in the region. Low cost air quality sensors developed locally in sub-Saharan Africa presents a sustainable operating mechanism that may help generate the air monitoring data needed for exposure estimation of air pollution with LUR models. The primary objective of our study is to investigate whether a network of locally developed low-cost air quality sensors can be used in LUR modeling for accurately predicting monthly ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution in urban areas of central and eastern Uganda. Secondarily, we aimed to explore whether the application of machine learning (ML) can improve LUR predictions compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We used data for the entire year of 2020 from a network of 23 PM2.5 low-cost sensors located in urban municipalities of eastern and central Uganda. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, these sensors collected highly time-resolved measurement data of PM2.5 air concentrations. We used monthly-averaged PM2.5 concentration data for LUR prediction modeling of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. We used eight different ML base-learner algorithms as well as ensemble modeling. We applied 5-fold cross validation (80% training/20% test random splits) to evaluate the models with resampling and Root mean squared error (RMSE). The relative explanatory power and accuracy of the ML algorithms were evaluated by comparing coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE, using OLS as the reference approach. The overall average PM2.5 concentration during the study period was 52.22 ?g/m3 (IQR: 38.11, 62.84 ?g/m3)Âwell above World Health Organization PM2.5 ambient air guidelines. From the base-learner and ensemble models, RMSE and R2 values ranged between 7.65 ?g/m3 Â 16.85 ?g/m3 and 0.24Â0.84, respectively. Extreme gradient boosting (xgbTree) performed best out of the base learner algorithms (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 7.65 ?g/m3). Model performance from ensemble modeling with Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models (glmnet) did not outperform xgbTree, but prediction performance was comparable to that of xgbTree. The most important temporal and spatial predictors of monthly PM2.5 levels were monthly precipitation, percent of the population using solid fuels for cooking, distance to Lake Victoria, and greenspace (NDVI) within a 500-m buffer of air monitors. In conclusion, data from locally developed low-cost PM sensors provide evidence that they can be used for spatio-temporal prediction modeling of air pollution exposures in Uganda. Moreover, the non-parametric ML and ensemble approaches to LUR modeling clearly outperformed OLS regression algorithm for the prediction of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. Deploying low-cost air quality sensors in concert with implementation of data quality control measures, can help address the critical need for expanding and improving air quality monitoring in resource-constrained settings of sub-Saharan Africa. These low-cost sensors, in conjunction with non-parametric ML algorithms, may provide a rapid path forward for PM2.5 exposure assessment and to spur air pollution epidemiology research in the region.

Researchers estimate that exposure to particulate matter from fossil fuel emissions accounted for 18% of deaths in 2018Âa challenge policymakers argue is being exacerbated by the increase in the number of extreme weather events and rapid urbanization as they tinker with strategies for reducing air pollutants. Drawing on a number of ensemble machine learning methods that have emerged as a result of advancements in data science, this study examines the effectiveness of using ensemble models for forecasting the concentrations of air pollutants, using PM2.5 as a representative case. A comprehensive evaluation of the ensemble methods was carried out by comparing their predictive performance with that of other standalone algorithms. The findings suggest that hybrid models provide useful tools for PM2.5 concentration forecasting. The developed models show that machine learning models are efficient in predicting air particulate concentrations, and can be used for air pollution forecasting. This study also provides insights into how climatic factors influence the concentrations of pollutants found in the air. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Alternatively, waste to energy (WTE) systems have been recently adopted to provide sustainable waste management and diversify the energy mix. The abundance of remotely sensed datasets and derivatives, along with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, can offer an effective solution for WTE site selection. In this study, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based framework supported by multiple machine learning algorithms (gradient boosted tree (GBT), decision tree (DT), and support vector machines (SVMs)) was established to explore the optimum location for WTE facilities. Various social, legal, environmental, economic, morphological, and land cover parameters were considered under 11 thematic geospatial raster layers. The proposed framework was applied to the 1.5-million-capita city of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. A novel approach was developed to incorporate Gaussian dispersion modeling for the expected air pollution emissions from a WTE facility. The results showed that the accuracy performance sequence of the algorithms was 94.6, 93.9, and 91.8% for GBT, DT, and SVM, respectively. It was found that the distance from existing landfills had the most critical impact on the optimum location of the WTE facility, followed by the distance from coastline and elevation. The AHP consistency check revealed an acceptable overall criteria consistency index and the ratio of 0.0344 and 0.019, respectively. The results showed that 16.6% of Sharjah was considered extremely highly suitable areas. This research supports decision-makers in developing local guidelines for siting WTE facilities and determining the most suitable locations for such projects.

Deep learning methods based on time series have been highly accurate in predicting PM2.5. However, most time series models lack the ability for spatial generalization because they cannot combine the analysis at different spatial scales. In addition, temporal long-term trend analysis have not been reported in most of the studies. In this study, to reveal the spatiotemporal variability and trends of PM2.5, an improved deep learning framework named the SpatioTemporal Enhanced Neural Network (STENN) is developed for estimating PM2.5 concentrations with a spatial resolution of 1 km. Based on the bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) structure and attention mechanisms, the model provides a geographic-data-driven approach to incorporate the impact of the spatial heterogeneity and time dependence of PM2.5, which demonstrates that it has robust spatiotemporal transferable power with an R2 of 0.89 produced by cross validation (CV). High-resolution (1 km) and high-quality annual PM2.5 products for mainland China from 2014 to 2020 were constructed. In comparison with the current 1-km PM2.5 products, our framework demonstrates better stability in different regions, especially in terms of the high-value estimations and spatial continuity. The spatiotemporal PM2.5 distributions were also analyzed based on the time-series products. After the implementation of various control policies for atmospheric pollution, a declining trend of PM2.5 concentrations was observed in 88.79% of China between 2014 and 2020, with a mean decrease rate of 3.35 ?g m?3 yr?1. This result indicates that the control policies of the Chinese government were effective in reducing PM2.5 concentrations. The PM2.5 concentrations in China reveal an exponential temporal trend, from a rapid decline to a gradual slowdown and a stable phase. To realize the vision of the Beautiful China Initiative, a regionally targeted policy for air pollution management is required. This study provides valuable implications for a more detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal variations in PM2.5 at small and medium spatial scales by developing an improved deep learning approach with a spatial generalization ability and integration with multi-temporal satellite products.

How to rationally consume fossil energy and control CO2 emissions has become an unavoidable problem for human beings while vigorously developing economy. This paper proposes a novel economy and CO2 emissions prediction model using an improved Attention mechanism based long short term memory (LSTM) neural network (Attention-LSTM) to analyze and optimize the energy consumption structures in different countries or areas. The Attention mechanism can add the weight of different inputs in the previous information or related factors to realize the indirect correlation between output and related inputs of the LSTM. Therefore, the Attention-LSTM can allocate more computing resources to the parts with a higher relevance of correlation in the case of limited computing power. Through inputs with the consumption of oil, natural gas, coal, hydroelectricity and renewable energy, the desirable output with the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and the undesirable output with CO2 emissions prediction model of different countries and areas is established based on the Attention-LSTM. The experimental results show that compared with the normal LSTM, the back propagation (BP), the radial basis function (RBF) and the extreme learning machine (ELM) neural networks, the Attention-LSTM is more accurate and practical. Meanwhile, the proposed model provides guidance for optimizing energy structures to develop economy and reasonably control CO2 emissions.

PM2.5 concentrations are associated with various spatiotemporal factors, which makes the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations still a challenging task. One of the reasons that makes the accurate prediction by statistical learning method difficult is severe fluctuations in input data. In addition, the abstraction method of space will also affect the prediction results. To address these important issues, a novel hybrid decomposing-ensemble and spatiotemporal attention (DESA) model is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy by decomposing the mode-mixed time series into single-mode series and automatically assign weights to the spatiotemporal factors. In our proposed framework, raw PM2.5 series are firstly decomposed into simple sub-series via the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) method. Then, to keep the results independent of the spatial abstraction method, a data-driven approach called multiscale spatiotemporal attention network is employed to extract spatiotemporal features from the sub-series. Finally, the predictions of each sub-series are processed separately and combined to obtain the final prediction results.

The air pollution forecast can provide important information to all affected sides, and allows appropriate measures to be taken. In order to address the problems of filling in the missing values in the time series used for air pollution forecasts, the automation of the allocation of optimal subset of input variables, the dependency of the air quality at a particular location on the conditions of the surrounding environment, as well as automation of the modelÂs optimization, this paper proposes a deep spatiotemporal model based on a 2D convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network for predicting air pollution. The model utilizes the automatic selection of input variables and the optimization of hyperparameters by a genetic algorithm. A hybrid strategy for missing value imputation is used based on a combination of linear interpolation and a strategy of using the average between the previous value and the average value for the same time in other years. In order to determine the best architecture of the spatiotemporal model, the architecture hyperparameters are optimized by a genetic algorithm with a modified crossover operator for solutions with variable lengths. Additionally, the trained models are included in various ensembles in order to further improve the prediction performanceÂthese include ensembles of models with the same architecture comprising the best architecture obtained by the evolutionary optimization, and ensembles of diverse models comprising the k best models of the evolutionary optimization. The experimental results for the Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data Set show that the proposed spatiotemporal model for air pollution forecasting provides good and consistent prediction results. The comparison of the suggested model with other deep NN models shows satisfactory results, with the best performance according to MAE, based on the experimental results for the station at Wanliu (16.753 Â± 0.384). Most of the model architectures obtained by the optimization of the model hyperparameters using the genetic algorithm have one convolutional layer with a small number of kernels and a small kernel size; the convolutional layers are followed by a max-pooling layer, and one or two LSTM layers are utilized with dropout regularization applied to the LSTM layer using small values of p (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3). The utilization of ensembles from the k best trained models further improves the prediction results and surpasses other deep learning models, according to MAE and RMSE metrics. The used hybrid strategy for missing value imputation enhances the results, especially for data with clear seasonality, and produces better MAE compared to the strategy using average values for the same hour of the same day and month in other years. The experimental results also reveal that random searching is a simple and effective strategy for selecting the input variables. Furthermore, the inclusion of spatial information in the modelÂs input data, based on the local neighborhood data, significantly improves the predictive results obtained with the model. The results obtained demonstrate the benefits of including spatial information from as many surrounding stations as possible, as well as using as much historical information as possible.

In this article, we present and discuss an innovative Deep Learning-based ensemble technique in forecasting the parking space occupancy to reduce the search time for parking and to optimize the flow of cars in particularly congested areas, with an overall positive impact on traffic in urban centres. A genetic algorithm has also been used to optimize predictors parameters. The main goal is to design an intelligent IoT-based service that can predict, in the next few hours, the parking spaces occupancy of a street.

With the recent implementation of first-level public health emergency response (FLPHER) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in China (a total of 77 041 confirmed cases by February 22, 2020), human activities were extremely decreased nationwide and almost all economic activities were suspended. Here, we show that this scenario represents an unprecedented ""base period""to probe the short-term emission control effect of air pollution at a city level. We quantify the FLPHER-induced changes of NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 levels in 174 cities in China. A machine learning prediction model for air pollution is established by coupling a generalized additive model, random effects meta-analysis, and weather research and forecasting model with chemistry analysis. The short-term control effect under the current energy structure in each city is estimated by comparing the predicted and observed results during the FLPHER period. We found that the short-term emission control effect ranges within 53.0%-98.3% for all cities, and southern cities show a significantly stronger effect than northern cities (P < 0.01).

Forecasting platform PM2.5 concentrations is significant in developing early warning systems, and regulating ventilation systems to ensure commuter health. However, the performance of existing forecasting approaches relies on a considerable amount of historical sensor data, which is usually not available in practical situations due to hostile monitoring environments or newly installed equipment. Transfer learning (TL) provides a solution to the scant data problem, as it leverages the knowledge learned from well-measured subway stations to facilitate predictions on others. This paper presents a TL-based residual neural network framework for sequential forecast of health risk levels traced by subway platform PM2.5 levels. Experiments are conducted to investigate the potential of the proposed methodology under different data availability scenarios. The TL-framework outperforms the RNN structures with a determination coefficient (R2) improvement of 42.84%, and in comparison, to stand-alone models the prediction errors (RMSE) are reduced up to 40%. Additionally, the forecasted data by TL-framework under limited data scenario allowed the ventilation system to maintain IAQ at healthy levels, and reduced PM2.5 concentrations by 29.21% as compared to stand-alone network.

It is of importance to establish prediction models to estimate PM2.5 concentration in indoor environments (e.g., residential households) to allow accurate assessments of exposure in epidemiological studies. This study aimed to develop models to predict PM2.5 concentration in residential households. PM2.5 concentration and related parameters (e.g., basic information about the households and ventilation settings) were collected in 116 households during the winter and summer seasons in Hong Kong. Outdoor PM2.5 concentration at households was estimated using a land-use regression model. The random forest machine learning algorithm was then applied to develop indoor PM2.5 prediction models. The results show that the random forest model achieved a promising predictive accuracy, with R2 and cross-validation R2 values of 0.93 and 0.65, respectively. Outdoor PM2.5 concentration was the most important predictor variable, followed in descending order by the household marked number, outdoor temperature, outdoor relative humidity, average household area and air conditioning. The external validation result using an independent dataset confirmed the potential application of the random forest model, with an R2 value of 0.47. Overall, this study shows the value of a combined land-use regression and machine learning approach in establishing indoor PM2.5 prediction models that provide a relatively accurate assessment of exposure for use in epidemiological studies.

Healthcare sector is evolving with the intervention of the latest computer-driven technology and has made a remarkable change in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Due to many governing factors including air pollution, there is a rapid rise in chest-related diseases and the number of such patients is rising at an alarming rate. In this research work, we have employed machine learning approach for the detecting various chest-related problems using convolutional neural networks (CNN) on an open dataset of chest X-rays. The method has an edge over the traditional approaches for image segmentation including thresholding, k-means clustering, and edge detection. The CNN cannot scan and process the whole image at an instant; it needs to recursively scan small pixel spots until it has scanned the whole image. Spatial transformation layers and VGG19 have been used for the purpose of feature extraction, and ReLU activation function has been employed due to its inherent low complexity and high computation efficiency; finally, stochastic gradient descent has been used as an optimizer. The main advantage of the current method is that it retains the essential features of the image for prediction along with incorporating a considerable dimensional reduction. The model delivered substantial improvement over existing research in terms of precision, f-score, and accuracy of prediction. This model if used precisely can be very effective for healthcare practitioners in determining the thoracic or pneumonic symptoms in the patient at an early stage thus guiding the practitioner to start the treatment immediately leading to fast improvement in the health status of the patient.

We evaluated whether including spatially-varying relationships could improve European LUR models by using geographically weighted regression (GWR) and random forest (RF). We built separate LUR models for each year from 2000 to 2019 for NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 using annual average monitoring observations across Europe. Potential predictors included satellite retrievals, chemical transport model estimates and land-use variables. Supervised linear regression (SLR) was used to select predictors, and then GWR estimated the potentially spatially-varying coefficients. We developed multi-year models using geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR). Five-fold cross-validation per year showed that GWR and GTWR explained similar spatial variations in annual average concentrations (average R2 = NO2: 0.66; O3: 0.58; PM10: 0.62; PM2.5: 0.77), which are better than SLR (average R2 = NO2: 0.61; O3: 0.46; PM10: 0.51; PM2.5: 0.75) and RF (average R2 = NO2: 0.64; O3: 0.53; PM10: 0.56; PM2.5: 0.67).

Historical long-term PM2.5 records with high temporal resolution are essential but lacking for both research and environmental management. Here, we reconstruct a site-based PM2.5 dataset at 6 h intervals from 1960 to 2020 that combines long-term visibility, conventional meteorological observations, emissions, and elevation. The PM2.5 concentration at each site is estimated based on an advanced machine learning model, LightGBM, that takes advantage of spatial features from 20 surrounding meteorological stations. Our model's performance is comparable to or even better than those of previous studies in by-year cross validation (CV) (R-2 = 0.7) and spatial CV (R-2 = 0.76) and is more advantageous in long-term records and high temporal resolution.

Accurate estimation of PM2.5 concentrations can timely assist relevant agencies to conduct air pollution treatment and provide essential data sources for epidemiological research related to PM2.5 exposure. Although China has established a network for monitoring ground-level PM2.5 concentrations over the past decades, the limited available records from the sparsely located PM2.5 monitoring sites hinder the fine-resolution research of air pollution. Many studies have been conducted to fill the data gap caused by sparsely distributed monitoring sites, but the accuracy of different models varies greatly. In recent years, machine learning models have become the preferred choices due to their high estimation accuracy. However, the estimation accuracy may differ significantly in different study areas with different models, and there are few studies on model performance evaluation regarding the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. This study evaluated the performance of six machine learning models for estimating PM2.5 concentrations in PRD from August 2014 to December 2019. Moreover, multi-source data were adopted for reliable daily PM2.5 concentration estimation, including meteorology, vegetation, topography, and point of interest (POI). The results show that the tree-structured models (i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT)) generally produce better estimations than other models. Two neural network models (i.e., Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Elman Neural Network (ENN)) show a similar estimation accuracy. Additionally, the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) generally gives the worst performance, followed by the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model.

We developed empirical models based on mobile monitoring data and features extracted from similar to 52 500 GSV images using a deep learning model. We tested theory- and data-driven feature selection methods as well as models using images within varying buffer sizes (50-2000 m). Compared to LUR models with traditional variables, our models achieved similar model performance using the street-level predictors while also identifying additional potential hotspots. Adjusted R-2 (10-fold CV R-2) with integrated feature selection was 0.57-0.64 (0.50-0.57) and 0.65-0.73 (0.61-0.66) for BC and PN models, respectively. Models using only features near the measurement locations (i.e., GSV images within 250 m) explained -50% of air pollution variability, indicating PN and BC are strongly affected by the street-level built environment.

In this study, a fully convolutional network (FCN)-based deep learning regression model was proposed to overcome the limitations of conventional computational methods and deep neural network (DNN) architectures. Through a data-driven image-to-image training model, rapid prediction of the mean age of air (MAA) was realized without spatial information loss. In addition, even for the changed internal geometry, robust MAA prediction was realized without additional model training or structural changes via a data preprocessing method of generating 2D images. Consequently, compared with the DNN regression model, prediction error using the FCN-based model, in terms of mean absolute error and root mean squared error, was decreased by ∼43.14% and ∼34.77%, respectively. Furthermore, the prediction performances for untrained conditions using additional prepared test datasets were compared quantitatively and qualitatively, depending on the divided zones.

Therefore, improving air pollution forecasts from wildfires is essential and informing citizens of more frequent, accurate, and interpretable updates related to localized air pollution events. This research proposes a multi-head attention-based deep learning architecture, SpatioTemporal (ST)-Transformer, to improve spatiotemporal predictions of PM2.5 concentrations in wildfire-prone areas. The ST-Transformer model employed a sparse attention mechanism that concentrates on the most useful contextual information across spatial, temporal, and variable-wise dimensions. The model includes critical driving factors of PM2.5 concentrations as predicting factors, including wildfire perimeter and intensity, meteorological factors, road traffic, PM2.5, and temporal indicators from the past 24 h. The model is trained to conduct time series forecasting on PM2.5 concentrations at EPA's air quality stations in the greater Los Angeles area. Prediction results were compared with other existing time series forecasting methods and exhibited better performance, especially in capturing abrupt changes or spikes in PM2.5 concentrations during wildfire situations. The attention matrix learned by the proposed model enabled interpretation of the complex spatial, temporal, and variable-wise dependencies, indicating that the model can differentiate between wildfires and non-wildfires. The ST-Transformer model's accurate predictability and interpretation capacity can help effectively monitor and predict the impacts of wildfire smoke and be applicable to other complex spatiotemporal prediction problems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160446,9,9,Yes,STT,,Yes,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The causal factors affecting the change in PM2.5 of three cities in Korea, and five major cities in China were determined. The analysis revealed that the three models showed similarly high performances in short-term prediction within 24 h (R2 ≥ 0.9). The Bi-LSTM model using both past and future time information showed high prediction accuracy for long-term prediction (R2 ≥ 0.6). Using the PM2.5 data of the five major Chinese cities, it was confirmed that the accuracy of the PM2.5 prediction model for Seoul, Daejeon, and Busan improved. The deep learning model showed a high accuracy even when the Fine Dust Act measures were implemented.

However, it is still difficult to qualitatively analyze the source of a single aerosol particle using noncontact in situ techniques. Hence, we proposed using optical trapping to combine gated Raman spectroscopy with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in a single levitated micron aerosol. The findings of the spectroscopic imaging indicated that the particle plasma formed by a single particle ablation with a pulsed laser within 7 ns deviates from the trapped particle location. The LIBS acquisition field of view was expanded using the 19-bundle fiber, which also reduces the fluctuation of a single particle signal. In addition, gated Raman was utilized to suppress the fluorescence and increase the Raman signal-to-noise ratio. Based on this, Raman can measure hard-to-ionize substances with LIBS, such as sulfates. The LIBS radical can overcome the restriction that Raman cannot detect ionic chemicals like fluoride and chloride in halogens. To test the capability of directly identifying distinctive feature compounds utilizing spectra, we detected anions using Raman spectroscopy and cations using LIBS. Four typical mineral aerosols are subjected to precise qualitative evaluations (marble, gypsum, baking soda, and activated carbon adsorbed potassium bicarbonate). To further validate the application potential for substances with indistinctive feature discrimination, we employed machine learning algorithms to conduct a qualitative analysis of the coal aerosol from ten different origin regions. Three data fusion methodologies (early fusion, intermediate fusion, and late fusion) for Raman and LIBS are implemented, respectively. The accuracy of the late fusion model prediction using StackingClassifier is higher than that of the LIBS data (66.7%) and Raman data (86.1%) models, with an average accuracy of 90.6%.

Chemical fractionation of possibly toxic substances in airborne particles becomes a vital element. Among the primary and secondary air pollutants, airborne particulate matter (APM) received considerable internet among research communities owing to the adversative impact on human health. Hence, size distribution details of airborne heavy metals are important in assessing the adverse health effects over the globe.

This article proposes a comprehensive method to forecast AQIs. Initially, the work focused on predicting hourly ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 using artificial neural networks. Once the method was developed, the work was extended to the prediction of other criteria pollutants, i.e., O3, SO2, NO2, and CO, which fed into the process of estimating AQI. The prediction of the AQI not only requires the selection of a robust forecasting model, it also heavily relies on a sequence of pre-processing steps to select predictors and handle different issues in data, including gaps. The presented method dealt with this by imputing missing entries using missForest, a machine learning-based imputation technique which employed the random forest (RF) algorithm. Unlike the usual practice of using RF at the final forecasting stage, we utilized RF at the data pre-processing stage, i.e., missing data imputation and feature selection, and we obtained promising results. The effectiveness of this imputation method was examined against a linear imputation method for the six criteria pollutants and the AQI. The proposed approach was validated against ambient air quality observations for Al-Jahra, a major city in Kuwait. Results obtained showed that models trained using missForest-imputed data could generalize AQI forecasting and with a prediction accuracy of 92.41% when tested on new unseen data, which is better than earlier findings.

By conducting a vehicle-mounted mobile monitoring experiment, we establish spatial distribution data sets for PM2.5 and PM10 on three typical regions in Huangpu District, Shanghai. 9 indicators of urban morphology are derived, including green view index and sky view factor, using semantic segmentation and deep learning on street-view images.

Among all the particulate matter of air pollution, PM2.5 (whose aerodynamic diameter is 2.5Â ?m or less) is of particular concern. Long-term exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5 can negatively affect human health. The negative effects of PM2.5 make forecast its concentration an urgent need. In this paper, we propose a novel Factory-aware Attentional LSTM Model (FAA-LSTM) for PM2.5 air pollution predictions. The proposed model collects air pollution data from both the monitor stations and micro air quality sensors, in which a spatial transformation is designed to obtain the local area data of PM2.5 grids. Next, a novel factory-aware attention mechanism over a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is proposed to extract the hidden features of industrial factors and derive their factory attention weights on the influences of PM2.5 concentrations. The influence of neighboring factory data over local PM2.5 grids can be weighted to discover the importance of PM2.5 concentrations of neighboring areas. Moreover, the model combines these heterogeneous data and the global station data to forecast PM2.5 concentrations. The experimentÂs evaluation is conducted using both air pollution data and industrial data. The results show that the factory-aware attention mechanism helps to improve the prediction performance by exploring the effect of the factory distribution on PM2.5 pollutants in the local areas. While monitoring stations have been established to collect air quality information and forecast air quality, few studies have taken the different monitoring areas and industrial features into account. The proposed novel model considering PM2.5 concentrations from local neighboring areas and global station, and industrial data as features can effectively indicate the impact of PM2.5 pollution with industrial emissions and spatial relationships. Our research work can improve the prediction accuracy of PM2.5 and contribute to increasing the practical value for air quality management.

Land use regression (LUR) is one of the most important methods to reveal the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5, and the introduction of characteristic variables of geographical factors and the improvement of model construction methods are important research directions for its optimization. However, the complex non-linear correlation between PM2.5 and influencing indicators is always unrecognized by the traditional regression model. The two-dimensional landscape pattern index is difficult to reflect the real information of the surface, and the research accuracy cannot meet the requirements. As such, a novel integrated three-dimensional landscape pattern index (TDLPI) and machine learning extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST) improved LUR model (LTX) are developed to estimate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the fine particle concentration in Shaanxi, China, and health risks of exposure and inhalation of PM2.5 were explored. The LTX model performed well with R2 = 0.88, RMSE of 8.73 ?g/m3 and MAE of 5.85 ?g/m3. Our findings suggest that integrated three-dimensional landscape pattern information and XGBOOST approaches can accurately estimate annual and seasonal variations of PM2.5 pollution The Guanzhong Plain and northern Shaanxi always feature high PM2.5 values, which exhibit similar distribution trends to those of the observed PM2.5 pollution. This study demonstrated the outstanding performance of the LTX model, which outperforms most models in past researches. On the whole, LTX approach is reliable and can improve the accuracy of pollutant concentration prediction. The health risks of human exposure to fine particles are relatively high in winter. Central part is a high health risk area, while northern area is low. Our study provides a new method for atmospheric pollutants assessing, which is important for LUR model optimization, high-precision PM2.5 pollution prediction and landscape pattern planning.

The relationship between PM2.5 and its spatiotemporal predictors was modeled using six learners; generalized additive models, elastic net, support vector regressions, random forests, neural networks and extreme gradient boosting. Subsequently, these predictions were combined under a generalized additive model framework using a tensor product based spatial smoothing. Overall cross-validated prediction accuracy of the model was 80% over the study period with high spatial model accuracy and predicted annual average concentrations ranging from 87 to 138 ?g/m3. Annual average root mean squared errors for the ensemble averaged predictions were in the range 39.7Â62.7 ?g/m3 with prediction bias ranging between 4.6 and 11.2 ?g/m3.

Recently, different approaches have been implemented to develop WNMs and quantify the lockdown effects of COVID-19 on air quality, including Machine Learning (ML). However, more advanced methods, such as Deep Learning (DL), have never been applied for developing WNMs. In this study, we proposed WNMs based on DL algorithms, aiming to test five DL architectures and compare their performances to a recent ML approach, namely Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The concentrations of five air pollutants (CO, NO2, PM2.5, SO2, and O3) are studied in the city of Quito, Ecuador.

Recently, global reanalysis products of PM2.5 have come into the view. However, most studies focus on the validation and calibration of a single product regionally, few studies expand to a global scale and integrate multiple products. With the help of global open-source data provided by the OpenAQ platform, we propose a hybrid calibration method aimed to improve the accuracy of CAMSRA and the MERRA-2 PM2.5 products. In the study, the accuracy of the two datasets are assessed on multi-time scales at first. Secondly, we try to use some machine learning models to correct the deviation of the original products alone and then further explore the possibility of the hybrid calibration. Global-scale validation results show that CAMSRA products are generally overestimated (daily R = 0.6), and MERRA-2 products are underestimated (daily R = 0.3), which supports our hybrid calibration method to an extent. Using the Extremely Randomized Tree (ERT) to implement the separate calibration scheme, two products show different degrees of accuracy improvement, to be specific, R increases by 0.19 and 0.43 for daily CAMSRA and MERRA-2 products, respectively. Compared with the separate calibration modeling, the hybrid method performs better, with R reaching up to 0.81.

Effective Air Quality Index (AQI) forecasting can provide a reliable guarantee for pollution control and air quality warnings. In this research background, a spatial multi-resolution data-driven ensemble AQI forecasting model based on real-time decomposition is proposed. The model uses spatial correlation analysis to screen out the auxiliary sites that are most relevant to the target site. Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) decomposes the original AQI data into multiple subseries. The iterative refresh mechanism of real-time decomposition makes the decomposition method more valuable in engineering applications. The classic averaging method and deep learning-based Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) are used to obtain low-resolution data and high-resolution data, respectively. Subseries containing fluctuation information and depth features are input into Outlier Robust Extreme Learning Machine (ORELM) for forecasting. Multi-Objective Wolf Colony Algorithm (MOWCA) is utilized for the ensemble of multiple resolution predictors. Then, the high-correlation auxiliary sites tested by the Pearson method are input into the model where the target site is located. After the optimized ensemble of the new meta-heuristic bat algorithm, the final AQI forecasting result is produced. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed model, historical air quality data from 26 city monitoring stations in China is used for experimental comparison. Experimental results show that each component of the proposed model has a positive effect on the forecasting performance of the model.

The special period of COVID-19, especially in Hubei where the epidemic was the most severe, provides excellent research conditions for studying the contribution of anthropogenic activities to PM2.5 concentrations. We used an optimized deep learning model to predict PM2.5 concentration during the epidemic period in the cities of Hubei Province. The contributions of local anthropogenic activities to PM2.5 pollution were obtained by contrasting the predicted results with actual site observations. However, a strange phenomenon was revealed that Yichang, a city with low local anthropogenic contribution to PM2.5, was found to have severe haze in winter conflicting with our previous expectations. After further research, we found that an increased conversion of secondary aerosols caused by long-distance transport of pollutant gases from the northern region is the main cause of winter haze pollution in this city. This finding highlights the importance of joint regional prevention and control of air pollution.

However, it still remains a challenge due to the limited information of emission source and high uncertainties of the dynamic processes. In order to improve the accuracy of air pollutant concentration forecast, this study proposes a novel hybrid model using clustering, feature selection, real-time decomposition by empirical wavelet transform, and deep learning neural network. First, all air pollutant time series are decomposed by empirical wavelet transform based on real-time decomposition, and subsets of output data are constructed by combining corresponding decomposed components. Second, each subset of output data is classified into several clusters by clustering algorithm, and then appropriate inputs are selected by feature selection method. Third, a deep learning-based predictor, which uses three dimensional convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory neural network, is applied to predict decomposition components of each cluster. Last, air pollutant concentration forecast for each monitoring station is obtained by reconstructing predicted values of all the decomposition components. PM2.5 concentration data of Beijing, China is used to validate and test our model. Results show that the proposed model outperforms other models used in this study. In our model, mean absolute percentage error for 1, 6, 10 h ahead PM2.5 concentration prediction is 4.03%, 6.87%, and 8.98%, respectively. These outcomes demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model is a powerful tool to provide highly accurate forecast for air pollutant concentration.

At present, most remote sensing based approaches for the estimation of PM2.5 and PM10 employed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products as the main variate. Nevertheless, the coverage of missing data is generally large in AOD products, which can cause deviations in practical applications of estimated PM2.5 and PM10 (e.g., air quality monitoring and exposure evaluation). To efficiently address this issue, our study explores a novel approach using the datasets of the precursors &amp; chemical compositions for PM2.5 and PM10 instead of AOD products. Specifically, the daily full-coverage ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 are estimated at 5-km (0.05Â°) spatial girds across China based on Sentinel-5P and assimilated datasets (GEOS-FP). The estimation models are acquired via an advanced ensemble learning method named Light Gradient Boosting Machine in this paper. For comparison, the Deep Blue AOD product from VIIRS is adopted in a similar framework as a baseline (AOD-based). Validation results show that the ambient concentrations are well estimated through the proposed approach, with the space-based Cross-Validation R2s and RMSEs of 0.88 (0.83) and 11.549 (22.9) ?g/m3 for PM2.5 (PM10), respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed approach achieves better performance than the AOD-based in different cases (e.g., overall and seasonal). Compared to the related previous works over China, the estimation accuracy of our method is also satisfactory. Regarding the mapping, the estimated results through the proposed approach display consecutive spatial distribution and can exactly express the seasonal variations of PM2.5 and PM10. The proposed approach could efficiently present daily full-coverage results at 5-km spatial grids. It has a large potential to be extended for providing global accurate ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 at multiple temporal scales (e.g., daily and annual).

However, the existing ground-based PM2.5 monitoring network has sparsely-distributed sites and satellite cannot give 24-h PM2.5, which make it difficult to grasp the spatial and sub-daily variation characteristics of PM2.5. This study aims to fill that gap by establishing a virtual network of hourly PM2.5 concentration using the LightGBM model, based on the high-density ground meteorological observations at ~2400 sites across China. The virtual network shows a desirable performance of hourly PM2.5 estimation across China, with R2 of 0.86, root-mean-square error values of 14.99 ?g/m3, and mean absolute error of 9.48 ?g/m3 (the results of Cross-Validation). It also exhibits high spatial-temporal consistencies with the observed PM2.5. Spatially, the heaviest PM2.5 pollution is mainly distributed in eastern China (especially the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze and Pearl river deltas, and the Sichuan-Chongqing areas). Temporarily, PM2.5 exhibits remarkable seasonal and diurnal changes characterized by higher concentration in winter and nighttime and lower in summer and daytime. Meanwhile, we found that visibility can be used as the primary predictor in the machine learning model to enhance the accuracy of estimated PM2.5. The established virtual hourly PM2.5 network (~2400 stations) provides a more intuitive and detailed PM2.5 data for us to understand the diurnal variation of PM2.5 and monitor inter-regional transport of haze over China.

Additionally, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and various regression models have been built to estimate fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for future vehicle designs. This study reveals that the Univariate Polynomial Regression model is the best model for predictions from one vehicle feature input, with up to 98.6% accuracy. Multiple Linear Regression and Multivariate Polynomial Regression are good models for predictions from multiple vehicle feature inputs, with approximately 75% accuracy. Convolutional Neural Network is also a promising method for prediction because of its stable and high accuracy of around 70%. The results contribute to the quantifying process of energy cost and air pollution caused by transportation, followed by proposing relevant recommendations for both vehicle users and producers.

To evaluate human exposure to NO2 for public health assessment, maps of near-surface NO2 concentrations at a high resolution of 100 m are desirable. In this study, we report hourly maps of gridded near-surface NO2 concentrations that are produced using an extreme gradient-boosted tree ensemble for an Alpine domain (Switzerland and northern Italy) spanning two years, from June 2018 to May 2020. To estimate the NO2 distribution at ground level, we used satellite observations of NO2 vertical column density, land use data, meteorological fields and topographical information to train models with in situ NO2 ground measurements. The best model with this approach captured up to 59% of hourly NO2 variation for 40 test stations in the domain with a mean absolute error of 7.69?g/m3, performing especially well for urban regions with dense sampling. We present the first hourly maps of NO2 concentrations that reveal previously unresolved spatio-temporal variations. Local interpretations of the machine learning model demonstrate that TROPOMI NO2 satellite observations make a strong contribution to the information content of the near-surface NO2 maps besides their relatively coarse resolution (3.5 Ã 5.5 km2) and the fact that they are only available once a day under cloud-free conditions.

However, current PM2.5 concentration estimation, which is mainly based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological data, usually had a low spatial resolution (kilometers) and severe spatial missing problem, cannot be applied to intra-urban pollution monitoring. To solve these problems, top-of-atmosphere reflectance (TOAR), which contains both the information about land and atmosphere and has high resolution and large spatial coverage, may be efficiently used for PM2.5 estimation.

In this study, Himawari-8 AOD, meteorological factors, geographic information, and a new deep forest model were used to construct an AOD-PM2.5 estimation model in China. Hourly cross-validation results indicated that estimated PM2.5 values were consistent with the site observation values, with an R2 range of 0.82Â0.91 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.79Â14.72 ?g/mÂ³, among which the model performance reached the optimum value between 13:00 and 15:00 Beijing time (R2 &gt; 0.9). Analysis of the correlation coefficient between important features and PM2.5 showed that the model performance was related to AOD and affected by meteorological factors, particularly the boundary layer height. Deep forest can detect diurnal variations in pollutant concentrations, which were higher in the morning, peaked at 10:00Â11:00, and then began to decline. High-resolution PM2.5 concentrations derived from the deep forest model revealed that some cities in China are seriously polluted, such as Xi Âan, Wuhan, and Chengdu. Our model can also capture the direction of PM2.5, which conforms to the wind field. The results indicated that due to the combined effect of wind and mountains, some areas in China experience PM2.5 pollution accumulation during spring and winter.

In this paper, a new computerized framework based on building information modelling (BIM) and machine learning data-driven models is presented to analyze the optimum thermal comfort for indoor environments with the effect of natural ventilation. BIM provides geometrical and semantic information of the built environment, which are leveraged for setting the computational domain and boundary conditions of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. CFD modelling is conducted to obtain the flow field and temperature distribution, the results of which determine the thermal comfort index in a ventilated environment. BIMÂCFD provides spatial data, boundary conditions, indoor environmental parameters, and the thermal comfort index for machine learning to construct robust data-driven models to empower the predictive analysis. In the neural network, the adjacency matrix in the field of graph theory is used to represent the spatial features (such as zone adjacency and connectivity) and incorporate the potential impact of interzonal airflow in thermal comfort analysis. The results of a case study indicate that utilizing natural ventilation can save cooling power consumption, but it may not be sufficient to fulfil all the thermal comfort criteria. The performance of natural ventilation at different seasons should be considered to identify the period when both air conditioning energy use and indoor thermal comfort are achieved. With the proposed new framework, thermal comfort prediction can be examined more efficiently to study different design options, operating scenarios, and changeover strategies between various ventilation modes, such as better spatial HVAC system designs, specific room-based real-time HVAC control, and other potential applications to maximize indoor thermal comfort.

Moreover, we estimated the all-cause deaths attributed to NO2 exposure at a high spatial resolution of about 1 km, with totals of 6082, 4200, and 18,210 for Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Provinces in 2020, respectively. We observed remarkable regional differences in the health impacts due to NO2 among urban, suburban, and rural areas. Generally, the STNN model could incorporate spatiotemporal neighboring information and infer surface NO2 concentration with full coverage and high accuracy. Compared with machine learning regression techniques, STNN can effectively avoid model overfitting and simultaneously consider both spatial and temporal correlations of input variables using deep convolutional networks with residual blocks. The use of the proposed STNN model, as well as the surface NO2 dataset, can benefit air quality monitoring, forecasting, and health burden assessments.

Traditionally, urban air quality is measured by networks of stationary monitors that are not universally available and sparsely sited. Mobile air quality monitoring using equipped vehicles is a promising alternative but has focused on vehicle-level experiments and lacks fleet-level demonstration. Here, we equipped 260 electric vehicles in a ride-hailing fleet in Beijing, China with low-cost sensors to collect real-time, spatial-resolved data on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. Using this data, we developed a decision tree model to infer the distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing at 1 km by 1 km and 1 h resolution. Our results are able to show both short- and long-term variations of urban PM2.5 concentrations and identify local air pollution hotspots. Compared with a benchmark model that only uses data from stationary monitoring sits, our model has shown significant improvement with the coefficient of determination increased from 0.56 to 0.80 and root mean square error decreased from 12.6 to 8.1 ?g/m3. To the best of our knowledge, this study collects the largest mobile sensor data for urban air quality monitoring, which are augmented by state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to derive high-quality urban air pollution mapping. Our results demonstrate the potential and necessity of using fleet vehicles as routine mobile sensors combined with advanced data science methods to provide high-resolution urban air quality monitoring.

Generalized linear models (GLM), a typical choice for ecological modeling, have well-established limitations. These limitations include apriori assumptions, inability to handle multicollinearity, and considering differential effects as the fixed effect. We propose an Ensemble-based Dynamic Emission Model (EDEM) to address these limitations. EDEM is developed at the intersection of network science and ensemble learning, i.e., a specialized approach of machine learning. Generalized Additive Model (GAM), i.e., a variant of GLM, and EDEM are tested in Los Angeles and Ventura counties of California, which is one of the biggest SARS-CoV-2 clusters in the US. GAM depicts that a 1 ?g/m3, 1 ?g/m3, and 1 ppm increase (lag 0Â7) in PM 2.5, PM 10, and O3 is associated with 4.51% (CI: 7.01 to ?2.00) decrease, 1.62% (CI: 2.23 to ?1.022) decrease, and 4.66% (CI: 0.85 to 8.47) increase in daily SARS-CoV-2 cases, respectively. Subsequent increment in lag resulted in the negative association between pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 cases. EDEM results in an R2 score of 90.96% and 79.16% on training and testing datasets, respectively. EDEM confirmed the negative association between particulates and SARS-CoV-2 cases; whereas, the O3 depicts a positive association; however, the positive association observed through GAM is not statistically significant. In addition, the county-level analysis of pollutant concentration interactions suggests that increased emissions from other counties positively affect SARS-CoV-2 cases in adjoining counties as well. The results reiterate the significance of uniformly adhering to air pollution mitigation strategies, especially related to ground-level ozone.

According to the annual EEA reports, Poland is one of the most polluted countries in Europe, experiencing high PMx concentrations during winter that mostly result from large emissions and unfavourable weather conditions in combination with environmental features. Thus, in addition to implementing municipal mitigation strategies, alerting residents to pollution episodes through accurate PMx forecasting is necessary. This research aimed to assess the feasibility of short-term PMx forecasting via machine learning (ML) and the subsequent identification of the primary meteorological covariates. The data comprised 10 years of hourly winter PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations measured at 11 urban air quality monitoring stations, including background, traffic, and industrial sites, in four large Polish agglomerations, viz., Pozna?, KrakÃ³w, ?Ã³d?, and Gda?sk, which cover areas with high population density and diverse environments that extend from the Baltic Sea coast (Tricity) through the lowlands (Pozna? and ?Ã³d?) to the highlands (KrakÃ³w). We tested four ML models: AIC-based stepwise regression, two tree-based algorithms (random forests and XGBoost), and neural networks. Employing analysis and cross-validation, we found that XGBoost performed the best, followed by random forests and neural networks, and stepwise regression performed the worst. This ranking was apparent in the threshold exceedance values of the binary forecasts obtained via regression.

These sensors, however, most often produce data of lower accuracy than higher-end instruments. In this study, we investigated linear and random forest models to correct PM2.5 measurements from the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment (DDPHE)Âs network of low-cost sensors against measurements from co-located U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Federal Equivalence Method (FEM) monitors. Our training set included data from five DDPHE sensors from August 2018 through May 2019. Our testing set included data from two newly deployed DDPHE sensors from September 2019 through mid-December 2019. In addition to PM2.5, temperature, and relative humidity from the low-cost sensors, we explored using additional temporal and spatial variables to capture unexplained variability in sensor measurements. We evaluated results using spatial and temporal cross-validation techniques. For the long-term dataset, a random forest model with all time-varying covariates and length of arterial roads within 500 m was the most accurate (testing RMSE = 2.9 ?g/m3 and R2 = 0.75; leave-one-location-out (LOLO)-validation metrics on the training set: RMSE = 2.2 ?g/m3 and R2 = 0.93). For on-the-fly correction, we found that a multiple linear regression model using the past eight weeks of low-cost sensor PM2.5, temperature, and humidity data plus a near-highway indicator predicted each new week of data best (testing RMSE = 3.1 ?g/m3 and R2 = 0.78; LOLO-validation metrics on the training set: RMSE = 2.3 ?g/m3 and R2 = 0.90). The statistical methods detailed here will be used to correct low-cost sensor measurements to better understand PM2.5 pollution within the city of Denver.

Previous studies estimated varying PM2.5-related mortality in China due to the usage of different source data, but rarely justify the data selection. To quantify the sensitivity of mortality assessment to source data, we first constructed state-of-the-art PM2.5 predictions during 2000Â2018 at a 1-km resolution with an ensemble machine learning model that filled missing data explicitly. We also calibrated and fused various gridded population data with a geostatistical method. Then we assessed the PM2.5-related mortality with various PM2.5 predictions, population distributions, exposure-response functions, and baseline mortalities. We found that in addition to the well documented uncertainties in the exposure-response functions, missingness in PM2.5 prediction, PM2.5 prediction error, and prediction error in population distribution resulted to a 40.5%, 25.2% and 15.9% lower mortality assessment compared to the mortality assessed with the best-performed source data, respectively. With the best-performed source data, we estimated a total of approximately 25 million PM2.5-related mortality during 2001Â2017 in China. From 2001 to 2017, The PM2.5 variations, growth and aging of population, decrease in baseline mortality led to a 7.8% increase, a 42.0% increase and a 24.6% decrease in PM2.5-related mortality, separately. We showed that with the strict clean air policies implemented in 2013, the population-weighted PM2.5 concentration decreased remarkably at an annual rate of 4.5 ?g/m3, leading to a decrease of 179 thousand PM2.5-related deaths nationwide during 2013Â2017. The mortality decrease due to PM2.5 reduction was offset by the population growth and aging population.

In addition, a moving camera was used to collect real-time traffic. Models developed for fine particulate matter performed better than those for black carbon. For the same pollutants, machine learning exhibited superior performance over LUR, demonstrating that LUR performance could benefit from understanding how explanatory variables were expressed in machine learning models.

The RODDA model aims to improve the accuracy of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The DA model ingests information from observed data in the simulation provided by the CFD model. The results of the DA are used to train a neural network learning a function which predicts the misfit between the results of the CFD model and the DA model. Thus, the trained function is combined with the original CFD model in order to generate forecasts with implicit DA given by neural network. Due to the time complexity of the numerical models used to implement DA and the neural network, and due to the scale of the forecasting area considered for forecasting problems in real case scenarios, the implementation of RODDA mandated the introduction of opportune reduced spaces. Here, RODDA is applied to a CFD simulation for air pollution, using the CFD software Fluidity, in South London (UK). We show that, using this framework, the data forecasted by the coupled model CFD+RODDA are closer to the observations with a gain in terms of execution time with respect to the classic predictionÂcorrection cycle given by coupling CFD with a standard DA. Additionally, RODDA predicts future observations, if not available, since these are embedded in the data assimilated state in which the network is trained on. The RODDA framework is not exclusive to air pollution, Fluidity, or the study area in South London, and therefore the workflow could be applied to different physical models if enough temporal data are available.

The identification of the locations that are the primary sources of dust, especially in arid and semi-arid environments, remains a challenge as these sites are often in remote or data-scarce regions. In this study, a new method using state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms Â random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) Â was evaluated for its ability to spatially model the distribution of dust-source potential in eastern Iran. To accomplish this, empirically identified dust-source locations were determined with the ozone monitoring instrument aerosol index and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue aerosol optical thickness methods. The identified areas were divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Measurements of the conditioning factors (lithology, wind speed, maximum air temperature, land use, slope angle, soil, rainfall, and land cover) were compiled for the study area and predictive models were developed. The area-under-the-receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and true-skill statistics (TSS) were used to validate the maps of the models' predictions. The results show that the RF algorithm performed best (AUC = 89.4% and TSS = 0.751), followed by the SVM (AUC = 87.5%, TSS = 0.73) and the MARS algorithm (AUC = 81%, TSS = 0.69). The results of the RF indicated that wind speed and land cover are the most important factors affecting dust generation. The region of highest dust-source potential that was identified by the RF is in the eastern parts of the study region. This model can be applied to other arid and semi-arid environments that experience dust storms to promote management that prevents desertification and reduces dust production.

The automated occupancy sensing systems that are most prevalent today analyze either environmental conditions (i.e., room temperature or data from entities in the room, such as states of electronic devices) to make human occupancy predictions.

To address this issue, the paper puts forth a lean, vision-based system that estimates the number of occupants and recognizes their activities using the stacked history of unconstrained non-deterministic human movements over transient intervals. The system implements a multi-stream deep neural network to identify human activities and uses the YOLO V3 deep neural network for object detection to estimate occupancy count in a room.

Â© 2020 Elsevier LtdParticulate matter (PM) emission is one of the leading environmental pollution issues associated with the coal mining industry. Before any control techniques can be employed, however, an accurate prediction of PM concentration is desired. Towards this end, this work aimed to provide an accurate estimation of PM concentration using a hybrid machine-learning technique. The proposed predictive model was based on the hybridazation of random forest (RF) model particle swarm optimization (PSO) for estimating PM concentration. The main objective of hybridazing the PSO was to tune the hyper-parameters of the RF model. The hybrid method was applied to PM data collected from an open-cut coal mine in northern China, the Haerwusu Coal Mine. The inputs selected were wind direction, wind speed, temperature, humidity, noise level and PM concentration at 5 min before. The outputs selected were the current concentration of PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 ?m), PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 ?m) and total suspended particulate (TSP). A detailed procedure for the implementation of the RF_PSO was presented and the predictive performance was analyzed. The results show that the RF_PSO could estimate PM concentration with a high degree of accuracy. The Pearson correlation coefficients among the average estimated and measured PM data were 0.91, 0.84 and 0.86 for the PM2.5, PM10 and TSP datasets, respectively. The relative importance analysis shows that the current PM concentration was mainly influenced by PM concentration at 5 min before, followed by humidity &gt; temperature ? noise level &gt; wind speed &gt; wind direction. This study presents an efficient and accurate way to estimate PM concentration, which is fundamental to the assessment of the atmospheric quality risks emanating from open-cut mining and the design of dust removal techniques.

In this work, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to analyze and predict ambient PM2.5 in eight regional core cities in China to resolve the clashes, and the conclusions are listed as follows. Gaseous air pollutants (SO2, NO2, O3 and CO) are way more momentous than meteorological conditions in shaping PM2.5. PM2.5 level is dominated by the ups and downs of gaseous air pollutants, indicating the predominance of secondary inorganic aerosols and the existence of thermodynamic equilibrium between PM2.5 and gaseous air pollutants. The secondary PM2.5 tends to be generated within one hour. We quantitatively demonstrate that the primary emissions change and long-range transport are ubiquitously and conspicuously insignificant throughout the main cities of China and reductions of the gaseous air pollutants are most essential for regulating PM2.5. Furthermore, the phenology of local flora as the minor cause and lopsided thermodynamic equilibrium shift triggered by temperature change as the major cause elicit the severity of PM2.5 in wintertime--for every Celsius degree of temperature drop, PM2.5 increases by 5.9 ?g/m3.

In this study, the Prophet forecasting model (PFM) was used to predict both short-term and long-term air pollution in Seoul. The air pollutants forecasted in this study were PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, and CO, air pollutants responsible for numerous health conditions upon long-term exposure. Current chemical models to predict air pollution require complex source lists making them difficult to use. Machine learning models have also been implemented however their requirement of meteorological parameters render the models ineffective as additional models and infrastructure need to be in place to model meteorology. To address this, a model needs to be created that can accurately predict pollution based on time. A dataset containing three years worth of hourly air quality measurements in Seoul was sourced from the Seoul Open Data Plaza. To optimize the model, PFM has the following parameters: Model type, changepoints, seasonality, holidays, and error. Cross validation was performed on the 2017-18 data; then, the model predicted 2019 values. To compare the predicted and actual values and determine the accuracy of the model, the statistical indicators: Mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and coverage were used. PFM predicted PM2.5 and PM10 with a MAE value of 12.6 mg/m3 and 19.6 mg/m3, respectively. PFM also predicted SO2 and CO with a MAE value of 0.00124 ppm and 0.207 ppm, respectively. PFM's prediction of PM2.5 and PM10 had a MAE approximately 2 times and 4 times less, respectively, than comparable models. PFM's prediction of SO2 and CO had a MAE approximately five times and 50 times less, respectively, than comparable models. In most cases, PFM's ability to accurately forecast the concentration of air pollutants in Seoul up to one year in advance outperformed similar models proposed in literature. This study addresses the limitations of the prior two PFM studies by expanding the modelled air pollutants from three pollutants to six pollutants while increasing the prediction time from 3 days to 1 year. This is also the first research to use PFM in Seoul, Korea. To achieve more accurate results, a larger air pollution dataset needs to be implemented with PFM. In the future, PFM should be used to predict and model air pollution in other regions, especially those without advanced infrastructure to model meteorology alongside air pollution. In Seoul, Seoul's government can use PFM to accurately predict air pollution concentrations and plan accordingly.

Our hybrid model CEEMD+CRJ+MLR is the first attempt to improve CRJ in the field of air pollution prediction and ozone forecasting. For this novel framework, CEEMD has been adopted to decompose original MDA8_O3 history into several sub-series. After that, for each IMF, CRJ is used to extract time-series features. These time-series features are fed into appropriate machine learning methods for prediction. In addition to that, residual is also predicted through normal methods. A model, which is trained with data from 1 May 2014 to 31 May 2017, is validated with data from 1 June 2017 to 30 May 2018, obtained from four stations of Beijing, China. The hybrid model has input variables which are combined with related pollutants, meteorological forecasts and UV index, and predict maximum daily 8-h average ozone (MDA8_O3) concentration in different time intervals. Our experimental results show that the CEEMD+CRJ+MLR model exhibits the best performance compared with other benchmark models generally. For four stations, IA, MAE, RMSE and MAPE average of +1 (forecasting 1 day in advance) are 0.9763, 12.84, 17.81 and 18.5% respectively and of +2 are 0.9679, 15.17, 20.15 and 23.86% respectively. Especially in the case of forecasting heavy ozone concentration (Level III), a critical issue in air pollution predictions, the classification rate of our hybrid model has improved from 29.4% (for CRJ) to 83.4% in +1 and from 38% (for CRJ) to 73% in +2. For long time forecasting, the CEEMD+CRJ+MLR also shows its outstanding performance in whole levels and level III ozone concentration. Our hybrid model, with accurate and stable results, is highly effective for MDA8_O3 concentration prediction and can efficiently be applied in other regions.

This study attempts to examine the effectiveness of air pollution control regulations implemented in Beijing during 2008-2019 through a data-driven regulatory intervention analysis. Our proposed Bayesian deep learning model utilizes proxy data including Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and meteorology as well as socio-economic data, while accounting for confounding effects via propensity score estimation. Our results show that air pollution control regulatory measures implemented in China and Beijing during 2008-2019 reduced PM2.5 pollution in Beijing by 11 % on average. After the introduction of Action Plan for Clean Air in China and Beijing in late 2013, as compared to the hypothetical PM2.5 concentration (without any regulatory interventions), the estimated PM2.5 reduction increased dramatically from 15 % in 2015 to 44 % in 2018. Our results suggest that Beijing's air quality has improved gradually over the past decade, though the annual PM(2.5 )pollution still exceeds the WHO threshold. In this regard, the air pollution control regulations introduced in Beijing and China tend to become more effective after 2015, suggesting a 2-year time lag before the stringent air pollution control regulations starting from 2013 takes any strong positive effects. Moreover, as compared to the air pollution control regulations introduced before 2013, newly introduced policy-making governance, which couples the policy-makings of the local jurisdictions with that of the central government, and the new policy measures that tackle the vested interests of the local stakeholders in Beijing and its nearby cities, alongside with the stringent local and national air pollution control regulations and plans, should help reduce air pollution and promote healthy living in Beijing over the longer term.",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,10.1016/j.envsci.2020.10.004,23,8,No,,,,"Peoples R China,England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to explore the association between prenatal ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure and early childhood neurodevelopment in a large birth cohort study of 4009 maternal-child pairs. Prenatal daily PM2.5 exposure concentrations at 1 km spatial revolution were estimated using high-performance machine-learning models. Neurodevelopmental outcomes of children at ages 2, 6, 12, and 24 months were assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ).

General linear mixed models with binomially distributed errors were used to estimate the effect of prenatal PM2.5 exposure on suspected developmental delay (SDD) in five developmental domains based on the longitudinal design. Prenatal PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with decreased scores for all neurodevelopmental domains of children at ages 2, 6, and 24 months. Each 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with increased risk of SDD for all subjects (RR: 1.52 95% CI: 1.19, 2.03), specifically, in problem-solving domain for girls (RR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.22, 4.35). Prenatal PM2.5 exposure in weeks 18 to 34 was significantly associated with both ASQ scores and SDDs. Our study proposed that prenatal PM2.5 exposure affected early childhood neurodevelopment evaluated with the ASQ scale.

First, we attempted to understand the association between the COVID-19 transmission rate, environmental factors (air pollution, weather, mobility), and socio-political parameters (Government Stringency Index, GSI). Second, we evaluated the efficiency of various strategies, including radical opening, intermittent lockdown, phase lift, and contact tracing, to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and get back to pre-pandemic conditions using a stochastic individual-based epidemiology model. Third, we used a deep learning approach and simulated the vaccination rate and the time for reaching herd immunity. The analysis was done based on the collected data from eight countries in Asia, including Iran, Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, South Korea, and Russia (as a transcontinental country). Our findings in the first part highlighted a noninfluential impact from the weather-driven parameters and short-term exposure to pollutants on the transmission rate; however, long-term expo -sure could potentially increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality rates (based on 1998-2017 p.m.2.5 data). Mobility was highly correlated with the COVID-19 transmission and based on our causal analysis reducing mobility could curb the COVID-19 transmission rate with a 6-day lag time (on average). Secondly, among all the tested policies for exiting the COVID-19 pandemic, the contact tracing was the most efficient if executed correctly. With a 2-day delay in tracing the virus hosts, a 60% successful host tracing, and a 70% contact reduction with the hosts, a pandemic will end in a year without overburdening a healthcare system with 6000 hospital beds capacity per million. Lastly, our vaccine simulations showed that the target date for achieving herd immunity significantly varied among the countries and could be delayed to October-november 2022 in countries like India and Iran (based on 60% immunized population and assuming no intermediate factors affecting the vaccination rate).",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,10.1016/j.envres.2021.111657,22,8,No,,,,"United States,Iran",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PM2.5 forecasting models can be used to create strategies for assessing and warning the public about anticipated harmful levels of air pollution. Accurate pollutant concentration measurements and forecasting are critical criteria for assessing air quality and are the foundation for making the right strategic decisions. Data-driven machine learning models for PM2.5 forecasting have gained attention in the recent past. In this study, PM2.5 prediction for Hyderabad city was carried out using various machine learning models viz. Multi-Linear Regression (MLR), decision tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. A deep learning model, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, was also used in this study. The results obtained were finally compared based on error and R2 value. The best model was selected based on its maximum R2 value and minimal error. The model's performance was further improved using the randomized search CV hyperparameter optimization technique. Spatio-temporal air quality analysis was initially conducted, and it was found that the average winter PM2.5 concentrations were 68% higher than the concentrations in summer. The analysis revealed that XGBoost regression was the best-performing machine learning model with an R2 value of 0.82 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.01 μg/ m3, whereas the LSTM deep learning model performed better than XGBoost regression for PM2.5 modeling with an R2 value of 0.89 and an MAE of 5.78 μg/ m3. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Ecological Informatics,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102067,8,8,Yes,"XBG,LSTM",,Yes,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six operating parameters (velocity, engine speed, engine torque, engine coolant temperature, fuel/air ratio, and intake air mass flow) collected through on-board diagnostic interface were used as predictors of exhaust emissions. The importance of each parameter to the emission predictions were comprehensively analyzed by comparing the coefficient of determination, root mean square error, cumulative emissions, and instantaneous emission rates. The emission prediction accuracy of ANN tends to increase as more parameters were considered as model inputs at the same time. However, the level of accuracy improvement depends on the input parameters. For CO2 emissions, engine torque and fuel/air ratio were good predictors for achieving high prediction accuracy. The relative importance of intake air mass flow rate and fuel/air ratio was high for NOx and CO predictions, respectively. In addition, the emission prediction accuracy of ANN depends on the vehicle type (Euro 5, Euro 6b, Euro 6d-temp). The emission prediction accuracy of vehicles equipped with after-treatment devices (selective catalytic reduction and lean NOx trap) was lower than that of vehicles without after-treatment devices. © 2022",Atmospheric Environment,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.119508,8,8,No,,,,South Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Balancing thermal comfort, IAQ, and energy consumption is thus a challenging task. However, the main problem faced in such research is that it is inefficient to conduct traditional experiments or numerical simulation to obtain the optimal air supply parameters from a large number of variables. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop a rapid prediction and optimization framework of IAQ, occupant comfort, and energy consumption. Firstly, Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to create the database containing indoor velocity, temperature and CO2 concentration for different distributions of occupants and ventilation parameters. Next, the extreme learning machine (ELM) model optimized by the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm is developed to predict the thermal comfort level and CO2 concentration, and the input parameters of the prediction models are interpolated to generate more cases. Finally, the satisfied air supply parameters for various optimization objectives are determined by combining the predicted PMV value and CO2 concentration with the energy consumption analysis. The results of the comprehensive analysis showed that the average concentration of CO2 after optimization is reduced and the |PMV|avg is reduced to less than 0.5, which is within acceptable limits. In addition, 14.34% energy saving is achieved in the illustrative example.

Faster region-based convolutional neural network (RCNN) models were trained to detect the number of people and occupancy activities respectively, and deployed to an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered camera. Experimental tests were carried out within a case study room to assess the performance of this approach. Due to the less complexity of people counting model, it achieved an average intersection over union (IoU) detection accuracy of about 98.9%, which was higher than activity detection model of about 88.5%. During the detection, the count-based occupancy profiles were produced according to the real-time information about the number of people and their activities. To estimate the effect of this approach on indoor air quality and energy demand, scenario-based modelling of the case study building under four ventilation scenarios was carried out via building energy simulation (BES). Results showed that the proposed approach could provide demand-driven ventilation controls data on the dynamic changes of occupancy to improve the indoor air quality (IAQ) and address the problem of under- or over-estimation of the ventilation demand when using the static or fixed profiles.

Therefore, it is very important to accurately forecast air quality in Macao. Machine learning methods such as random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), support vector regression (SVR), and multiple linear regression (MLR) were applied to predict the levels of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations in Macao. The forecast models were built and trained using the meteorological and air quality data from 2013 to 2018, and the air quality data from 2019 to 2021 were used for validation. Our results show that there is no significant difference between the performance of the four methods in predicting the air quality data for 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 2021 (the new normal period). However, RF performed significantly better than the other methods for 2020 (amid the pandemic) with a higher coefficient of determination (R2) and lower RMSE, MAE, and BIAS. The reduced performance of the statistical MLR and other ML models was presumably due to the unprecedented low levels of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in 2020.

Sensors are deployed for pollutant exposure assessments and long-term IAQ monitoring. How to optimize sensor placements in single rooms has been studied. However, limited studies on sensor placement in a multi-zone indoor environment have been conducted. On a typical office floor, room partitions can be changed by tenants, and conducting field measurements in the occupied tenant areas is not allowed. It is difficult to determine where to install a sensor. The related studies rarely consider different weather conditions and ventilation system settings when performing optimization. This study aims to develop a methodology to optimize temperature and CO2 sensor placement for thermal comfort and IAQ monitoring in a multi-zone environment under limited field measurement. Supported by building information modeling (BIM) technology, different seasons, MVAC system settings, and occupancy scenarios were taken into account when optimizing sensor placement. How to overcome limited information of the inaccessible regions by applying the conservation equations as well as considering the MVAC layout of the floor and sources of heat and CO2 emission were also illustrated. The methodology was illustrated using a validated Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a typical office floor. With the use of genetic algorithm (GA) and machine learning, the generated sensor placements fulfilled coverage requirements from LEED and over 70% of the regions with significant fluctuation in temperature and CO2 are inside the sensing range of sensors.

It can help a driver to pick the most optimized way to their target destination. Air pollution data are often connected with traffic congestion and there exists plenty of research on the connection between air pollution and traffic congestion using different machine learning approaches. A scheme for efficiently predicting traffic flow using ensemble techniques such as bagging and air pollution has not yet been introduced. Therefore, there is a need for a more accurate traffic flow prediction system for the smart cities. The aim of this research is to forecast traffic flow using pollution data. The contribution is twofold: Firstly, a comparison has been made using different simple regression techniques to find out the best-performing model. Secondly, bagging and stacking ensemble techniques have been used to find out the most accurate model of the two comparisons. The results show that the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) bagging ensemble provides far better results than all the other regression models used in this study.

Recent studies have revealed the effectiveness of early-warning mechanisms that enable the public reduce their exposure to air pollutants. This highlights the need for accurate air quality forecasts. However, air quality in many developing and highly urbanised countries remains unmonitored. Hence, a novel spatiotemporal interpolation modelling approach based on a deep learning and wavelet pre-processing technique was proposed in this paper. In more detail, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) were utilised to model the spatial variability of hourly NO2 levels at six urban sites in Central London, the United Kingdom. The models were trained using only the NO2 concentration data from the neighbouring sites. Benchmark models such as plain LSTM and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were also developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models. The proposed wavelet-based spatiotemporal models were found to provide superior forecasting results, explaining 77% to 93% of the variability of the actual NO2 concentration levels at most sites.

First, the augmented matrix technique is embedded into the slow feature analysis model to create a DSFA model to cope with the time lag inherent in the actual measurement process. Then, the constructed DSFA model is used to extract slowly varying latent variables to capture the dynamic trend within the input data. Finally, taking the latent variables as the input and aiming at the nonlinearity in the data, RF is used to predict the particle concentration. The results show that the prediction performance of the DSFA-RF model is better than some traditional soft sensor models, including partial least squares, support vector regression, single RF, and a hybrid model. The root mean square error value of DSFA-RF is improved by 21.93% compared with the hybrid model based on principal component analysis and support vector regression.

We evaluate the performance of several machine learning algorithms applied to air quality and meteorology datasets and compare prediction accuracies of Bishkek air quality given its significant public importance. Data on 16 synoptic atmospheric process were collected by Kyrgyzhydromet from 2016 to 2018 and used to train and build a forecasting model. The model was then tested using data collected in 2020. Climate change in Bishkek and the impact on air pollution was assessed via the frequency of days characterized by daytime temperature inversions and air stagnation. Atmospheric stability increased from 2015 to 2020 with ongoing climate change leading to more temperature inversions. About 80%Â90% of days with temperature inversions are associated with winter heating seasons and these numbers increased two-fold during the past 5 years.

Here, we use nine PM2.5 concentration models (i.e., exposure models) that span a wide range of methods to investigate i) PM2.5 concentrations in 2011, ii) potential changes in PM2.5 concentrations between 2011 and 2028 due to on-the-books regulations, and iii) PM2.5 exposure for the U.S. population and four racial/ethnic groups. The exposure models included two geophysical chemical transport models (CTMs), two interpolation methods, a satellite-derived aerosol optical depth-based method, a Bayesian statistical regression model, and three data-rich machine learning methods. We focused on annual predictions that were regridded to 12-km resolution over the conterminous U.S., but also considered 1-km predictions in sensitivity analyses. The exposure models predicted broadly consistent PM2.5 concentrations, with relatively high concentrations on average over the eastern U.S. and greater variability in the western U.S. However, differences in national concentration distributions (median standard deviation: 1.00 ?g m-3) and spatial distributions over urban areas were evident. Further exploration of these differences and their implications for specific applications would be valuable. PM2.5 concentrations were estimated to decrease by about 1 ?g m-3 on average due to modeled emission changes between 2011 and 2028, with decreases of more than 3 ?g m-3 in areas with relatively high 2011 concentrations that were projected to experience relatively large emission reductions. Agreement among models was closer for population-weighted than uniformly weighted averages across the domain. About 50% of the population was estimated to experience PM2.5 concentrations less than 10 ?g m-3 in 2011 and PM2.5 improvements of about 2 ?g m-3 due to modeled emission changes between 2011 and 2028. Two inequality metrics were used to characterize differences in exposure among the four racial/ethnic groups. The metrics generally yielded consistent information and suggest that the modeled emission reductions between 2011 and 2028 would reduce absolute exposure inequality on average.

A bottom-up approach, which is a typical emission inventory estimation method, requires a lot of human labor and material resources, whereas a top-down approach focuses on individual pollutants that can be measured directly as well as relying heavily on traditional numerical modeling. Lately, the deep neural network approach has achieved rapid development due to its high efficiency and nonlinear expression ability. In this study, we proposed a novel method to model the dual relationship between an emission inventory and pollution concentrations for emission inventory estimation. Specifically, we utilized a neural-network-based comprehensive chemical transport model (NN-CTM) to explore the complex correlation between emission and air pollution. We further updated the emission inventory based on back-propagating the gradient of the loss function measuring the deviation between NN-CTM and observations from surface monitors. We first mimicked the CTM model with neural networks (NNs) and achieved a relatively good representation of the CTM, with similarity reaching 95%. To reduce the gap between the CTM and observations, the NN model suggests updated emissions of NOx, NH3, SO2, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and primary PM2.5 changing, on average, by -1.34%, -2.65%, -11.66%, -19.19% and 3.51%, respectively, in China for 2015. Such ratios of NOx and PM2.5 are even higher (?1/410%) in regions that suffer from large uncertainties in original emissions, such as Northwest China. The updated emission inventory can improve model performance and make it closer to observations. The mean absolute error for NO2, SO2, O3 and PM2.5 concentrations are reduced significantly (by about 10%-20%), indicating the high feasibility of NN-CTM in terms of significantly improving both the accuracy of the emission inventory and the performance of the air quality model.

The existing deep learning-based predicted models generally consider either the temporal correlations of air quality monitoring stations or the nonlinear relationship between the PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 ?m) concentrations and explanatory variables. Spatial correlation has not been effectively incorporated into prediction models, therefore exhibiting poor performance in PM2.5 prediction tasks. Additionally, determining the manner by which to expand longer-term prediction tasks is still challenging. In this paper, to allow for spatiotemporal correlations, a spatiotemporal convolutional recursive long short-term memory (CR-LSTM) neural network model is proposed for predicting the PM2.5 concentrations in long-term prediction tasks by combining a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) neural network and a recursive strategy. Herein, the ConvLSTM network was used to capture the complex spatiotemporal correlations and to predict the future PM2.5 concentrations; the recursive strategy was used for expanding the long-term prediction tasks. The CR-LSTM model was used to realize the prediction of the future 24 h of PM2.5 concentrations for 12 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing by configuring both the appropriate time lag derived from the temporal correlations and the spatial neighbor-hood, including the hourly historical PM2.5 concentrations, the daily mean meteorological data, and the annual nighttime light and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results showed that the proposed CR-LSTM model achieved better performance (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.74; root mean square error (RMSE) = 18.96 ?g/m3) than other common models, such as multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), the conventional LSTM model, the LSTM extended (LSTME) model, and the temporal sliding LSTM extended (TS-LSTME) model.

To meet this demand, a novel multi-scale hybrid learning framework based on robust local mean decomposition (RLMD) and moving window (MW) ensemble strategy is developed for PM2.5 and PM10 forecasting. In this architecture, the RLMD is adopted to adaptively decompose the PMC time series (PMCTS) into several production functions and one residue with different frequencies. These subseries are simpler than the original PMCTS, but they still work alongside mode aliasing. Thus, following the well-established Âlinear and nonlinearÂ modeling philosophy, a novel hybrid learning framework, composed of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and combined kernel function relevance vector machine (RVMcom), is proposed to capture both the linear and nonlinear patterns in the subseries. To obtain better final outputs, based on the definition of the ensemble improvement degree, the MW ensemble method is used to merge the forecasting results of all subseries.

In order to achieve a win-win situation for the environment and urban development, the government has issued many policies to strengthen environmental protection. PM2.5 is the primary particulate matter in air pollution, so an accurate estimation of PM2.5 distribution is of great significance. Although previous studies have attempted to retrieve PM2.5 using geostatistical or aerosol remote sensing retrieval methods, the current rough resolution and accuracy remain as limitations of such methods. This paper proposes a fine-grained spatiotemporal PM2.5 retrieval method that comprehensively considers various datasets, such as Landsat 8 satellite images, ground monitoring station data, and socio-economic data, to explore the applicability of different machine learning algorithms in PM2.5 retrieval. Six typical algorithms were used to train the multi-dimensional elements in a series of experiments. The characteristics of retrieval accuracy in different scenarios were clarified mainly according to the validation index, R-2. The random forest algorithm was shown to have the best numerical and PM2.5-based air-quality-category accuracy, with a cross-validated R-2 of 0.86 and a category retrieval accuracy of 0.83, while both maintained excellent retrieval accuracy and achieved a high spatiotemporal resolution.

In this study, we present a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) model in the deep learning field, to predict the concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in different indoor settings, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the LSTM model. The selection of some key parameters on the LSTM model prediction is firstly discussed. We then analyze the concentrations of different VOCs emitted from three kinds of furniture in a controlled chamber, and concentrations of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO) and 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA) due to ozone/squalene reactions, in an occupied classroom. The model's predictions for the VOCs in the chamber tests, have all MAPE within 10%; for ozone and 6-MHO in the classroom tests, 85% of the MAPE is within 15%; and for 4-OPA, 82% of the MAPE is within 15%. The small MAPE indicates good performance. Comparison analysis reveals that the LSTM model is superior to the widely used artificial neural network (ANN) model. The LSTM approach doesn't require building complex physical or chemical models and measuring various key parameters, instead a learning network is established and the learning parameters are adjusted according to practical situations. This study demonstrates that the LSTM model is promising for the prediction of pollutant transport in various indoor environments.

In this study, we used AOD estimates of surface PM2.5 together with meteorological and land use variables to estimate monthly PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 3 km2 over Taiwan Island from 2015 to 2019. An ensemble two-stage estimation procedure was proposed, with a generalized additive model (GAM) for temporal-trend removal in the first stage and a random forest model used to assess residual spatiotemporal variations in the second stage.

Results: The validation against Taiwan's NO2 observations during 2005Â2012 showed that RBE-RF adequately corrected the substantial underestimation by Base-RF. The RMSE decreased from 10.1 to 8.2 Âµg/m3, 7.1 to 4.3 Âµg/m3, and 6.1 to 2.9 Âµg/m3 in predicting daily, monthly, and annual levels, respectively. For North China with the most severe pollution, the population-weighted NO2 ([NO2]pw) during 2005Â2012 was estimated as 40.2 and 50.9 Âµg/m3 by Base-RF and RBE-RF, respectively, i.e., 21.0% difference. While both models predicted that the national annual [NO2]pw increased during 2005Â2011 and then decreased, the interannual trends were underestimated by &gt;50.2% by Base-RF relative to RBE-RF. During 2005Â2018, the nationwide population that lived in the areas with NO2 &gt; 40 Âµg/m3 were estimated as 259 and 460 million by Base-RF and RBE-RF, respectively. Conclusion: With RBE-RF, we corrected the estimation bias in back-extrapolation and obtained a full-coverage dataset of daily surface NO2 across China during 2005Â2018, which is valuable for environmental management and epidemiological research.

In recent years, the ambient ozone concentration in China has shown an upward trend, and high-quality prediction of ozone concentrations has become critical to support effective policymaking. In this study, a novel hybrid model combining wavelet decomposition (WD), a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network and a support vector regression (SVR) model was developed to predict the daily maximum 8 h ozone. We used the ground ozone observation data in six representative megacities across China from Jan. 1, 2015 to Jun. 15, 2020 for model training, and we used data from Jun. 15 to Dec. 31, 2020 for model testing. The results show that the developed model performs very well for megacities; against observations, the model obtains an average cross-validated R2 (coefficient of determination) ranging from 0.90 for Shanghai to 0.97 for Chengdu in the one-step predictions, thereby indicating that the model outperformed any single algorithm or other hybrid algorithms reported. The developed model can also capture high ozone pollution episodes with an average accuracy of 92% for the next five days in inland cities. This study will be useful for the environmental health community to prevent high ozone exposure more efficiently in megacities in China and shows great potential for accurate ozone prediction using machine learning approaches.

However, little is known about local explanations and global understanding on the importance and effect of input features in the complex system of environmental stressors - mental disorders (MDs), especially for exposure to air pollution mixture. In this study, we combined deep learning neural networks (DLNNs) with SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) to predict the illness risk of MDs on the population level, and then provided explanations for risk factors. The modeling system, which was trained on day-by-day hospital outpatient visits of two major hospitals in Nanjing, China from 2013/07/01 through 2019/02/28, visualized the time-varying prediction, contributing factors, and interaction effects of informative features. Our results suggested that NO2, SO2, and CO made outstanding contributions in magnitude of feature attributions under circumstances of mixed air pollutants. In particular, NO2 at high concentration level was associated with an increase in illness risk of MDs, and the maximum and mean absolute SHAP value were approximated to 10 and 2 as a local and global measure of feature importance, respectively. It presented a marginally antagonistic effect for two pairs of gaseous pollutants, i.e., NO2 vs. SO2 and CO vs. NO2. In contrast, CO and SO2 displayed the opposite direction of feature effects to the rise of observed concentrations, but an apparent synergistic effect was obviously captured. The primary risk factors driving a sharp increase in acute attack or exacerbation of MDs were also identified by depicting prediction paths of time-series samples. We believe that the significance of coupling accurate predictions from DLNNs with interpretable explanations of why a prediction is completed has broad applicability throughout the field of environmental health.

The estimated PM2.5 concentrations for a two-year period (2018Â 2019) are evaluated against measurements performed at 65 air-quality monitoring stations located at urban, industrial, suburban and rural sites. PM2.5 concentrations varied widely between the sta-tions, with higher values (mean of 24.2 Â± 21.6 Âµg m?3) at urban/industrial stations and lower (mean of 21.3 Â± 18.4 Âµg m?3) at suburban/rural sites. Furthermore, pronounced seasonal variability in PM2.5 is recorded across Malaysia, with highest concentrations during the dry season (JuneÂSeptember). Seven models were developed for PM2.5 predictions, i.e., separately for urban/industrial and subur-ban/rural sites, for the four dominant seasons (dry, wet and two inter-monsoon), and an overall model, which displayed accuracies in the order of R2 = 0.46Â0.76. The validation analysis reveals that the RF model (R2 = 0.53Â0.76) exhibits slightly better performance than SVR, except for the overall model. This is the first study conducted in Malaysia for PM2.5 estimations at a national scale com-bining satellite aerosol retrievals with ground-based pollutants, meteorological factors and ML tech-niques.

Nationwide estimates of source-specific PM2.5 mass and constituents at local-scale would allow for epidemiological studies and health effects assessments that consider the variability in PM2.5 characteristics in their health impact assessments. In response, we developed US models of annual exposures at the census tract level for five major PM2.5 sources (traffic, soil, coal, oil, and biomass combustion) and six trace elements (elemental carbon, sulfur, silicon, selenium, nickel, and non-soil potassium) for 2001 through 2014. We employed Absolute Factor Analysis (APCA) to derive the source-specific PM2.5 impacts at monitoring stations. Random forest algorithms that incorporated predictors derived from satellite, chemical transport model, and census tract resolution land-use data on traffic, meteorology, and emissions, which were rigorously tested by 10-fold cross-validation (CV), were then employed to estimate elemental and source-specific PM2.5 levels at non-monitoring site census-tracts over the study years. Model performances were moderate to good, with CV R2 ranging from 0.41 to 0.95. For PM2.5 sources, the highest CV R2 was attained for traffic PM2.5 (CV R2 = 0.73), followed by coal (CV R2 = 0.65), oil (CV R2 = 0.62), soil (CV R2 = 0.60), and biomass (CV R2 = 0.41). Among constituents, the CV was highest for sulfur (CV R2 = 0.95). Our analyses provided highly resolved spatial estimates of annual elemental and source-specific PM2.5 concentrations at the census-tract level, for 2001 through 2014. This dataset offers exposure estimates in support of future nationwide long-term health effects studies of source-specific PM2.5 mass and constituents, enabling epidemiological research that addresses the fact that not all particles are the same.

To estimate the impact of port activities and that exclusively due to cruises, classical approaches would rely on atmospheric dispersion models. Although these tools retain the underlying physics, lack of details on background flow state and emission inventories limits their predictive capabilities. Using historical data on pollutant concentration, meteorology and traffic intensity at specific locations across the city of Barcelona, it was found that predictions of local pollutant concentration by the present Machine Learning tool are more accurate than those provided by the CALIOPE-Urban-v1.0 in our test cases.

Machine Learning (ML) models could be effective in identifying the most critical factors which are responsible for the overall fatalities caused by COVID-19. The functional capabilities of ML models in epidemiological research, especially for COVID-19, are not substantially explored. To bridge this gap, this study has adopted two advanced ML models, viz. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), to perform the regression modelling and provide subsequent interpretation. Five successive steps were followed to carry out the analysis: (1) identification of relevant key explanatory variables; (2) application of data dimensionality reduction for eliminating redundant information; (3) utilizing ML models for measuring relative influence (RI) of the explanatory variables; (4) evaluating interconnections between and among the key explanatory variables and COVID-19 case and death counts; (5) time series analysis for examining the rate of incidences of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Among the explanatory variables considered in this study, air pollution, migration, economy, and demographic factor were found to be the most significant controlling factors. Since a very limited research is available to discuss the superiority of ML models for identifying the key determinants of COVID-19, this study could be a reference for future public health research.

Therefore, forecasting PM2.5 requires collecting data from outside the country as well as from within which is necessary for policies and plans. The data set of many variables with a relatively small number of observations can cause a dimensionality problem and limit the performance of the deep learning model. This study used daily data for five years in predicting PM2.5 concentrations in eight Korean cities through deep learning models. PM2.5 data of China were collected and used as input variables to solve the dimensionality problem using principal components analysis (PCA). The deep learning models used were a recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). The performance of the models with and without PCA was compared using root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). As a result, the application of PCA in LSTM and BiLSTM, excluding the RNN, showed better performance: decreases of up to 16.6% and 33.3% in RMSE and MAE values.

We examine two methods to aid in gap-filling AOD: (1) lattice kriging, a spatial statistical method adapted to handle large amounts data, and (2) random forest, a tree-based machine learning method. First, we evaluate each modelÂs performance in the spatial prediction of AOD, and we additionally consider ensemble methods for combining the predictors.

Although air pollution could be forecasted using chemical and physical models, machine learning techniques showed promising results in this area, especially artificial neural networks. Despite its importance, there has not been any research on predicting ground-level ozone in Jordan. In this paper, we build a model for predicting ozone concentration for the next day in Amman, Jordan using a mixture of meteorological and seasonal variables of the previous day. We compare a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression (DTR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. We also explore the effect of applying various smoothing filters on the time-series data such as moving average, Holt-Winters smoothing and Savitzky-Golay filters.

To better address air pollution problems, an important step is the timely and accurate prediction of air quality. Traditional methods are mainly based on meteorological data, regression model data, remote sensing data and different retrieval methods. Numerous studies on deep learning methods have suggested that these approaches may be able to perform accurate predictions for complex systems. In this paper, a long short-term memory (LSTM) approach for predicting air quality is proposed; moreover, meteorological data are used and Chinese social media is investigated as a proxy for public perceptions and responses for air quality prediction. We gathered daily air quality data, meteorological data and Weibo check-in data for Beijing, China from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016.

The results indicated that the proposed method, which incorporates public response data, was especially suitable for predicting the air quality in extreme short-term social events and provides a timely social measurement and feedback for environmental problems.

Achieving satisfactory recovery factors in gas reservoirs is sensitive to the methane-brine/water interfaces induced by the interfacial tension (IFT) between these systems. Accordingly, accurate determination of IFT of the systems methane-brine/water is extremely important for natural gas production. In this paper, several intelligent models were implemented to accurately estimate interfacial tension (IFT) of the systems brine/pure water-methane under wide temperature, pressure and salinity ranges of (278.1Â477.59 K), (0.01Â260 MPa) and (0Â200,000 ppm), respectively. The established models were based on an extensive databank including 879 experimental measurements. The implemented intelligent models in this study were Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Least Square Vector Machine (LSSVM), and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN). Various optimization algorithms were applied for improving the learning phase of these models. Furthermore, a Committee Machine Intelligent System (CMIS) scheme was proposed by linking the best-found paradigm under a linear single model. The results showed that all the developed intelligent-based paradigms exhibit reliable prediction abilities. In addition, it was found that CMIS and GRNN are the fittest paradigms with overall absolute average percent relative error (AAPRE) values of 1.117% and 1.003%, respectively. Besides, the performance assessment revealed that our best paradigms outperform the existing approaches. Finally, the sensitivity analysis revealed that salinity has a slight impact on IFT.

However, due to the complexity of air quality prediction which usually involves multiple factors, such as meteorological, spatial, and temporal properties, it is still a challenge to propose a model with required accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid ensemble model CERL to exploit the merits of both forward neural networks and recurrent neural networks that are designed for handling time serial data to predict air quality hourly. Measured air pollutant factors including Air Quality Index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and O3 are used as input to predict air quality from 1 to 8 h ahead. Based on the air quality prediction evaluation in Lanzhou and XiÂan, which are two important provincial capitals in Northwest China, CERL provides better performance over other baseline models. Moreover, as the step length increases, CERL has more obvious improvement. For example, the improvements of CERL in the 1-step, 3-step, 5-step, and 8-step prediction for PM2.5 in Lanzhou are 1.82%, 8.01%, 9.98%, and 20.03%, respectively.

It not only causes serious losses to our economy, but also brings great hidden dangers to the physical and mental health of urban residents. Therefore, it is urgent to prevent and control air pollution. Air quality prediction and forecasting must be carried out to prevent air pollution. Timely and accurate air quality prediction can not only help urban managers to make scientific and effective preventive measures, but also provide more healthy and safe travel strategies for urban residents. ChinaÂs air monitoring system is gradually improving, its scale is expanding, and a large amount of air quality data is accumulating. With the rapid expansion of data scale, the traditional method of air quality prediction technology has been unable to deal with these massive data. In this paper, 365 sets of air pollutant data from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in Shen Zhen were used as experimental objects. The improved SAPSO algorithm and PSO algorithm were used to optimize the parameters of SVM model and construct the air quality evaluation model. By analyzing the classification results of air quality grade, selecting relevant data and using partial least squares, the correlation coefficient matrix is established for the classification results, and the pollutant factors affecting air quality in Shenzhen are obtained.

Therefore, we propose a method to predict urban air pollution from traffic by extracting data fromWeb-based applications (Google Traffic). We apply a machine learning approach by training a decision tree algorithm (C4.8) to predict the concentration of PM2.5 during the morning pollution peak from: (i) an interpolation (inverse distance weighting) of the value registered at the monitoring stations, (ii) traffic flow, and (iii) traffic flow + time of the day. The results show that the prediction from traffic outperforms the one provided by the monitoring network (average of 65.5% for the former vs. 57% for the latter). Adding the time of day increases the accuracy by an average of 6.5%. Considering the good accuracy on different days, the proposed method seems to be robust enough to create general models able to predict air pollution from traffic conditions. This affordable method, although beneficial for any city, is particularly relevant for low-income countries, because it offers an economically sustainable technique to address air quality issues faced by the developing world.

The chaotic behaviour of air pollutants posing major difficulties in tracking their three-dimensional movements over diverse temporal domains is a significant challenge in designing practical air quality systems. This research paper builds a deep learning hybrid CLSTM model where convolutional neural network (CNN) is amalgamed with the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to forecast hourly TSP. The CNN model entails a data processer including feature extractors that draw upon statistically significant antecedent lagged predictor variables, whereas the LSTM model encapsulates a new feature mapping scheme to predict the next hourly TSP value. The hybrid CLSTM model is comprehensively benchmarked and is seen to outperform an ensemble of five machine learning models. The efficacy of the CLSTM model is elucidated in model testing phase at study sites in Queensland, Australia. Using performance metrics, visual analysis of TSP simulations relative to observations, and detailed error analysis, this study ascertains the CLSTM model's practical utility for air pollutant forecasting systems in health risk mitigation.

Burning more fuel to generate electricity increases CO2 emissions to the air which causes air pollution and environmental issues. This study aims to calculate the amount of CO2 emission from the power sector specifically from each power plant in Kuwait in 2019 using combustion equation from United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change (IPCC). According to USEPA, total CO2 emissions from the power sector in Kuwait in 2019 were found to be 38.47 MtCO(2). However, IPCC equation gave total CO2 emissions of 45.57 MtCO(2). The second part of the research focused on forecasting CO2 emissions for 5 years (2018-2022) using machine learning (ML) algorithms, which are mainly support vector machine (SVM), deep learning (DL), and ANN.

In the first step, the AQI data were decomposed by complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and was hybridized with general regression neural network (GRNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) as HSD models. In the second step, using variational mode decomposition (VMD) technique the results of the first intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of CEEMDAN model were decomposed into nine VMs and were predicted by GRNN and ELM models to obtain IMF1. Finally, in the third step, GRNN and ELM were used again to predict the IMF(S)as HTPD models. Results showed that in predicting AQI series data by HSD models both CEEMDAN-ELM and CEEMDAN-GRNN models were similarly accurate.

However, typical horizontal resolutions of nationwide CMAQ simulations (12 Ã 12 km2) cannot capture local-scale gradients for accurately assessing human exposures and environmental justice disparities. In this study, a Bayesian ensemble machine learning (BEML) framework, which integrates 13 learning algorithms, was developed for downscaling CMAQ estimates of ozone daily maximum 8 h averages to the census tract level, across the contiguous US, and was demonstrated for 2011. Three-stage hyperparameter tuning and targeted validations were designed to ensure the ensemble model's ability to interpolate, extrapolate, and capture concentration peaks. The Shapley value metric from coalitional game theory was applied to interpret the drivers of subgrid gradients. The flexibility (transferability) of the 2011-trained BEML model was further tested by evaluating its ability to estimate fine-scale concentrations for other years (2012-2017) without retraining. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the BEML approach to strictly ""data-limited"" situations, the model was applied to downscale CMAQ outputs for a future-year scenario-based simulation that considers effects of variations in meteorology associated with climate change.

Results show increase in the number of clusters did not significantly alter results.

Fluctuations were observed in the behaviors of CO and NOx during the day while NOx displayed relative stability. Results also show that a direct and positive linear relationship exists between the PM10 (target pollutant) and CO, SO2, which suggests that these pollutants originate from the same sources. A semi-linear relationship is observed between the PM10 and others (O-3 and NOx) while humidity shows a negative linearity with PM10.

The data used to construct the novel hybrid two-stage data filtering technique based on LSTM comprising of six meteorological parameters (i.e., wind direction, wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and rainfall) and two environmental factors (i.e., ozone and total suspended particulate).

Recently, urban greenness has been proven to be associated with bike sharing usage around metro stations using a global model. However, their spatial associations and bike sharing usage on public holidays have seldom been explored in previous studies. In this study, urban greenness was obtained objectively using eye-level greenness with street-view images by deep learning segmentation and overhead view greenness from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to fill the research gap by exploring the spatially varying association between dockless bike sharing usage on weekdays, weekends, and holidays, and urban greenness indicators as well as other built environment factors. The results showed that eye-level greenness was positively associated with bike sharing usage on weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Overhead-view greenness was found to be negatively related to bike usage on weekends and holidays, and insignificant on weekdays. Therefore, to promote bike sharing usage and build a cycling-friendly environment, the study suggests that the relevant urban planner should pay more attention to eye-level greenness exposure along secondary roads rather than the NDVI. Most importantly, planning implications varying across the study area during different days were proposed based on GWR results. For example, the improvement of eye-level greenness might effectively promote bike usage in northeastern and southern Futian districts and western Nanshan on weekdays.

Satellite aerosols retrievals that are based on deep learning or machine learning approach have been widely discussed in remote sensing studies, but the flexible random forest (RF) model has not received much attention in the retrieval of geostationary satellite, like Himawari-8. Thus, the Himawari-8 aerosol retrieval achieved by RF model requires further investigation and optimization. Based on the radiative transfer equation, this study proposed a RF model driven by a differential operator, which quantifies a simple linear relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance enhancement. The spectral information of aerosols is achieved by independent TOA reflectance comparison between images rather than one result from multiple band synthesis. The method allows simple feature inputs and shows weak dependence on auxiliary data. It also achieves simultaneous retrievals over different surfaces and maintains mathematical correlation between spectral AODs and Angstrom Exponents (AE). The model performance was evaluated using a series of comprehensive temporal and spatial validation analyses. A sample-based tenfold cross-validation (10-CV) shows that the new method can simultaneously improve the estimation of aerosol properties, with considerably high correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.85 for AODs at the 0.50 μm wavelengths, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.08, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.13 and >70% of the samples fell within the AOD expected error (EE). The high accuracy of the spectral AOD retrievals also exhibits good performance on AE calculations, with at least 2/3 of the samples falling within the EE. The site based 10-CV also evaluates the spatial predictions on AODs at the 0.50 μm wavelength, with R2 of 0.67, MAE of 0.12 and RMSE of 0.18. It also has outperformed the Himawari operational aerosol products and appeared to be comparable to other popular machine learning models with better AE retrievals in some typical regions. Two typical regional pollution cases also highlight the advantages of the new aerosol monitoring approach. The 5 km resolution aerosol retrievals exhibit good spatial coverage and performance when describing the regional pollution levels and types. The proposed method improves the performance of RF in retrieving aerosol properties from geostationary satellites and also offers a new prospective for aerosol remote sensing using machine learning approaches. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Remote Sensing of Environment,10.1016/j.rse.2022.113426,7,7,No,,,,"China,Hong Kong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing PM2.5 concentrations derived from wildfire smoke and associated impacts on public health require dedicated epidemiological studies. Main sources of PM2.5 data are provided by government-operated monitors sparsely located across U.S., leaving several regions and potentially vulnerable populations unmonitored. Current approaches to estimate PM2.5 concentrations in unmonitored areas often rely on big data, such as satellite-derived aerosol properties and meteorological variables, apply computationally-intensive deterministic modeling, and do not distinguish wildfire-specific PM2.5 from other sources of emissions such as traffic and industrial sources. Furthermore, modelling wildfire-specific PM2.5 presents a challenge since measurements of the smoke contribution to PM2.5 pollution are not available. Here, we aim to use statistical methods to isolate wildfire-specific PM2.5 from other sources of emissions. Our study presents an ensemble model that optimally combines multiple machine learning algorithms (including gradient boosting machine, random forest and deep learning), and a large set of explanatory variables to, first, estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations at the ZIP code level, a relevant spatiotemporal resolution for epidemiological studies. Subsequently, we propose a novel implementation of an imputation approach to estimate the wildfire-specific PM2.5 concentrations that could be applied geographical regions in the US or worldwide. Our ensemble model achieved comparable results to previous machine learning studies for PM2.5 prediction while avoiding processing larger, computationally intensive datasets. Our study is the first to apply a suite of statistical models using readily available datasets to provide daily wildfire-specific PM2.5 at a fine spatial scale for a 15-year period, thus providing a relevant spatiotemporal resolution and timely contribution for epidemiological studies. © 2022 The Authors",Environment International,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107719,7,7,Yes,"GBM,RF,DNN",,Yes,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In present study, we proposed a novel method of positive matrix factorization-SHapley Additive explanation (PMF-SHAP) for evaluating the impact of emission sources on ozone formation, which can quantify the main emission sources of ozone pollution. In this method, we first used the PMF model to identify the source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and then quantified various emission sources using a combination of machine learning (ML) models and the SHAP algorithm. The R2 of the optimal ML model in this method was as high as 0.96, indicating that the prediction performance was excellent. Furthermore, we explored the impact of different emission sources on ozone formation, and found that ozone formation in Shenzhen was more affected by VOCs, of which vehicle emission sources may have the greatest impact. Our results suggest that the appropriate combination of traditional models with ML models can well address environmental pollution problems.

To improve its accuracy, a new hybrid prediction model of AQI based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), multivariate multiscale dispersion entropy (mvMDE), variational mode decomposition optimized by bald eagle search (BES) algorithm (BVMD) and kernel extreme learning machine optimized by rat swarm optimizer (RSO) algorithm (RSO-KELM), named CEEMDAN-mvMDE-BVMD-RSO-KELM, is proposed.

Therefore, the amount of PM10 in the air is monitored and forecasts are made to predict the air quality. In Poland, mainly deterministic models are used to predict air pollution. Accordingly, research efforts are being made to develop other models to forecast the ambient PM10 levels. The aim of the study was to compare the machine learning models for predicting PM10 levels in the air in the city of Lublin. The following machine learning models were used: Linear regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNNR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Regression Trees (RT), Gaussian Process Regression Models (GPR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The collected data for three consecutive years (January 2017 to December 2019) were used to develop the models. In total, 19 parameters, covering meteorological variables and concentrations of several chemical species, were explored as potential predictors of PM10. The data used to build the models did not take into account the seasons. The algorithms achieved the following R2 values: 0.8 for LR, 0.79 for KNNR, 0.82 for SVM, 0.77 for RT, 0.89, 0.90 for ANN and 0.81 for LSTM. Research has shown that the selection of a machine learning model has a large impact on the quality of the results. In this research, the ANN model performed slightly better than other models. Then, an ANN was used to train a network with five output neurons to predict the approximate level of PM10 at different time points (PM level at a given time, after 1 h, after 6 h, after 12 h and after 24 h). The results showed that the developed and tuned ANN model is appropriate (R = 0.89). The model created in this way can be used to determine the risk of exceeding the PM10 alert level and to inform about the air quality in the region.

It is important to examine the effectiveness of such emission reductions and assess the resulting changes in air quality. However, such evaluation is difficult as meteorological factors can amplify, or obscure the changes of air pollutants, in addition to the emission reduction. In this study, we applied the random forest machine learning technique to decouple meteorological influences from emissions changes, and examined the deweathered trends of air pollutants in 12 Chinese mega-cities during 2013Â2020. The observed concentrations of all criteria pollutants except O3 showed significant declines from 2013 to 2020, with PM2.5 annual decline rates of 6Â9% in most cities. In contrast, O3 concentrations increased with annual growth rates of 1Â9%. Compared with the observed results, all the pollutants showed smoothed but similar variation in trend and annual rate-of-change after weather normalization. The response of O3 to NO2 concentrations indicated significant regional differences in photochemical regimes, and the differences between observed and deweathered results provided implications for volatile organic compound emission reductions in O3 pollution mitigation. We further evaluated the effectiveness of first and second clean air actions by removing the meteorological influence. We found that the meteorology can make negative or positive contribution in reducing pollutant concentrations from emission reduction, depending on type of pollutants, locations, and time period. Among the 12 mega-cities, only Beijing showed a positive meteorological contribution in amplifying reductions in main pollutants except O3 during both clean air action periods. Considering the large and variable impact of meteorological effects in changing air quality, we suggest that similar deweathered analysis is needed as a routine policy evaluation tool on a regional basis.

Policy makers have tried to develop efficient responses based on technologies and advanced pandemic control methodologies, to limit the wide spreading of the virus in urban areas. However, techniques such as social isolation and lockdown are short-term solutions that minimize the spread of the pandemic in cities and do not invert long-term issues that derive from climate change, air pollution and urban planning challenges that enhance the spreading ability. Thus, it seems crucial to understand what kind of factors assist or prevent the wide spreading of the virus. Although AI frameworks have a very efficient predictive ability as data-driven procedures, they often struggle to identify strong correlations among multidimensional data and provide robust explanations. In this paper, we propose the fusion of a heterogeneous, spatio-temporal dataset that combine data from eight European cities spanning from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021 and describe atmospheric, socio-economic, health, mobility and environmental factors all related to potential links with COVID-19. Remote sensing data are the key solution to monitor the availability on public green spaces between cities in the study period. So, we evaluate the benefits of NIR and RED bands of satellite images to calculate the NDVI and locate the percentage in vegetation cover on each city for each week of our 2-year study. This novel dataset is evaluated by a tree-based machine learning algorithm that utilizes ensemble learning and is trained to make robust predictions on daily cases and deaths. Comparisons with other machine learning techniques justify its robustness on the regression metrics RMSE and MAE. Furthermore, the explainable frameworks SHAP and LIME are utilized to locate potential positive or negative influence of the factors on global and local level, with respect to our modelÂs predictive ability.

For the purpose of reducing monitoring costs and building health risk assessment models, a new deep learning forecasting model based on empirical mode decomposition, long short-term memory (LSTM) block and squeeze and excitation networks (SENet) is proposed. To begin, the original PM2.5 data is decomposed into multiple sub-series with varying frequencies using empirical mode decomposition. Then, an LSTM neural network is built to forecast the new sub-series. Finally, squeeze and excitation networks were constructed and coupled to automatically pick informative weights to obtain the real-time forecasting result. The proposed model is compared to other commonly used models such as convolutional neural network and LSTM for its ability to forecast PM2.5 on an hourly experiment. The proposed model outperforms reference models in terms of forecasting performance, owing to its ability to capture informative characteristics and temporal patterns from varying PM2.5 dataset.

In recent years, machine learning techniques have attracted increasing attention in O3 prediction owing to their high efficiency and simple operation. However, the accuracy of predicting the daily O3 level is low. This study proposed a novel model by coupling long short-term memory neural network with transfer learning (TL-LSTM), with meteorology and pollutant concentration information as the model input. L2 regularization was applied to reduce the risk of overfitting and to improve the accuracy and generalization ability of the model prediction. Our results indicated that by transferring the knowledge in the model configuration from the hourly LSTM module, TL-LSTM greatly improves the predictability of the daily maximum 8 h average (MDA8) of O3 in Hong Kong. The coefficient of determination (R2) increased from 0.684 to 0.783 and the mean square error (MSE) reduced from 1.36 Ã 10?2 to 1.05 Ã 10?2. Furthermore, R2 and MSE were the highest in summer, indicating an under-prediction of peak O3 levels. This was a result of the limited number of high O3 days, which did not provide sufficient knowledge for the model to make an accurate prediction. Sobol analysis indicated that wind speed was the most sensitive factor in O3 prediction, largely due to the development of land-sea breeze circulation which effectively traps pollutants and expedites O3 formation. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the TL-LSTM in predicting the daily O3 concentration in Hong Kong. Thus, TL-LSTM can be promulgated into other photochemically active regions to assist in O3 pollution forecasting and management.

This has provided an opportunity to quantify the extent to which carbon-based transport and industrial activity affect air quality. However, quantification of these complex effects has proven to be difficult, depending on the stringency of restrictions, country-specific emission source profiles, long-term trends and meteorological effects on atmospheric chemistry, emission levels and in-flow from nearby countries. In this study, confounding factors were disentangled for a direct comparison of pandemic-related reductions in absolute pollutions levels, globally. The non-linear relationships between atmospheric processes and daily ground-level NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and O3 measurements were captured in city- and pollutant-specific XGBoost models for over 700 cities, adjusting for weather, seasonality and trends. City-level modelling allowed adaptation to the distinct topography, urban morphology, climate and atmospheric conditions for each city, individually, as the weather variables that were most predictive varied across cities. Pollution forecasts for 2020 in absence of a pandemic were generated based on weather and formed an ensemble for country-level pollution reductions. Findings were robust to modelling assumptions and consistent with various published case studies. NO2 reduced most in China, Europe and India, following severe government restrictions as part of the initial lockdowns. Reductions were highly correlated with changes in mobility levels, especially trips to transit stations, workplaces, retail and recreation venues. Further, NO2 did not fully revert to pre-pandemic levels in 2020. Ambient PM2.5 pollution, which has severe adverse health consequences, reduced most in China and India. Since positive health effects could be offset to some extent by prolonged exposure to indoor pollution, alternative transport initiatives could prove to be an important pathway towards better health outcomes in these countries. Increased O3 levels during initial lockdowns have been documented widely. However, our analyses also found a subsequent reduction in O3 for many countries below what was expected based on meteorological conditions during summer months (e.g., China, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Poland, Turkey). The effects in periods with high O3 levels are especially important for the development of effective mitigation strategies to improve health outcomes.

The best model to use in predicting the next dayÂs PM10 concentration classification was the random forest classifier, with an accuracy of 98.37, sensitivity of 97.19, specificity of 99.55, and precision of 99.54, but the result of the boosted regression tree was substantially different from the RF model, with an accuracy of 98.12, sensitivity of 97.51, specificity of 98.72, and precision of 98.71. The best model can assist local governments in providing early warnings to people who are at risk of acute and chronic health consequences from air pollution. Â© 2022 by the authors.

In service of this overarching goal, this work pursues four objectives: 1) Determine which low-cost airborne pollutant sensors are useful for prediction of indoor air quality variables of interest, investigating whether a few commercially available sensors held value for making such predictions. 2) Investigate which algorithms are most useful for making these predictions. 3) Develop an understanding of how far into the future we can conceivably predict indoor concentrations based on low-cost airborne pollutant signals. 4) Investigate methods for predicting elevated concentration events from historical data. Four different methods (Rolling Average, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Long-Short Term Memory) for predicting eight indoor pollutant concentrations (carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, PM 1, PM 2.5, PM 10, formaldehyde, total volatile organic compounds) are compared for their ability to predict future sensor signals in a single commercial building in California. Long-Short Term Memory was consistently the best method for predicting indoor pollutants, though the best combinations of input variables differed depending on pollutant of interest. To predict elevated concentration events, results show that indirect classification through a regression prediction that was then compared to a threshold performed marginally better than a direct classification prediction for all pollutants except PM1.

While many IEQ models have been established to develop scheme for assessing the overall IEQ, the lack of model validation significantly limited their applicability. This study aimed to provide new insights into how occupants evaluate the overall IEQ performance by establishing regression models and machine learning models that predict occupantsÂ overall satisfaction using their satisfactions with the four principal domains of IEQ. Accuracy and applicability of proposed models were examined on two different datasets. Prediction error increased 21% when models were generalized to new dataset collected from different buildings and populations, and error of machine learning models increased more significantly than regression models. The model performance varied across building types. Models trained on samples collected from office settings had better generalization to the similar environment, while increased error was identified for schools and residences. The acoustic environment had a greater impact on females than males, while the IAQ had a greater impact on males. The Shapley Additive Explanations was applied to interpret model predictions and measure contribution of the variables. The results revealed that the unsatisfying IEQ factor often yielded a dominant negative impact on the overall IEQ satisfaction, which can hardly be compensated by a higher satisfaction with another factor. Efficient strategy can be developed to improve overall satisfaction with IEQ based on findings of the present study.

Studying the concentration of PM2.5, as the main component of haze, is the key to control air quality. Extent research lacks spatiotemporal correlations and full regional coverage. Therefore, a fine-grained prediction method was developed for continuous prediction of station-specific and regional PM2.5 concentrations over 24 h that comprise two parts: a site prediction model (TSRT model) and a grid prediction model. The TSRT model includes a long short-term memory-based temporal predictor that uses temporally related features as inputs, a Long Short-Term Memory-based spatial predictor that requires spatially related features as inputs, and a regression model based on regression-tree algorithm to aggregate the predictions of temporal and spatial predictors. The grid concentration prediction model based on a fully connected back-propagation neural network with grid characteristics as inputs achieved a PM2.5 regional prediction with 1-km2 non-overlapping grids across the study area. The approach was evaluated with data from 101 monitoring stations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. The results imply that: (1) the forecasting performance of TSRT models is better than other possible methods with average R2 = 0.9 and average MAE = 10.35 ?g/m3, (2) R2 and MAE values of the grid prediction model are 0.77 and 21.87 ?g/m3, supporting the advantages of our method over well-known interpolation models, such as kriging interpolation, and (3) the method provides appropriate PM2.5 concentration prediction in the next 24 h.

This paper proposes a restricted gradient-descent linear hybrid machine learning model (RGD-LHMLM) by integrating a random forest (RF), a gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), and a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the concentration of PM2.5 in China in 2019. The research data included Himawari-8 AOD with high spatiotemporal resolution, ERA5 meteorological data, and geographic information. The results showed that, in the hybrid model developed by linear fitting, the DNN accounted for the largest proportion, and the weight coefficient was 0.62. The R2 values of RF, GBRT, and DNN were reported as 0.79, 0.81, and 0.8, respectively. Preferably, the generalization ability of the mixed model was better than that of each sub-model, and R2 (determination coefficient) reached 0.84, and RMSE (root mean square error) and MAE (mean absolute error) were reported as 12.92 and 8.01?gm-3, respectively. For the RGD-LHMLM, R2 was above 0.7 in more than 70% of the sites and RMSE and MAE were below 20 and 15?gm-3, respectively, in more than 70% of the sites due to the correlation coefficient having a seasonal difference between the meteorological factor and PM2.5. Furthermore, the hybrid model performed best in winter (mean R2 was 0.84) and worst in summer (mean R2 was 0.71). The spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of PM2.5 in China were then estimated and analyzed. According to the results, there was severe pollution in winter with an average concentration of PM2.5 being reported as 62.10?gm-3. However, there was only slight pollution in summer with an average concentration of PM2.5 being reported as 47.39?gm-3. The period from 10:00 to 15:00LT (Beijing time, UTC+8 every day is the best time for model inversion; at this time the pollution is also high. The findings also indicate that North China and East China are more polluted than other areas, and their average annual concentration of PM2.5 was reported as 82.68?gm-3. Moreover, there was relatively low pollution in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Tibet, for their average PM2.5 concentrations were reported below 40?gm-3.

The polynomial function-based response surface model (pf-RSM) can rapidly predict the nonlinear response of PM2.5 and O3 to precursors, but has drawbacks of overload computation and marginal effects (relatively larger prediction errors under strict control scenarios). To improve the performance of pf-RSM, a novel self-adaptive RSM (SA-RSM) was proposed by integrating the machine learning-based stepwise regression for establishing robust models to increase the computational efficiency and the collinearity diagnosis for reducing marginal effects caused by overfitting. The pilot study case demonstrated that compared with pf-RSM, SA-RSM can effectively reduce the training number by 70% and 40% and the fitting time by 40% and 52%, and decrease the prediction error by 49% and 74% for PM2.5 and O3 predictions respectively; moreover, the isopleths of PM2.5 or O3 as a function of their precursors generated by SA-RSM were more similar to those derived by chemical transport model (CTM), after successfully addressing the marginal effect issue.

While an air quality ground monitoring station has limited coverage, remote-sensing-based monitoring of air pollution offers the advantage of large area coverage and a synoptic view of pollution dispersion. This study demonstrates the retrieval of particulate matter 10 (PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) using the multitemporal Landsat ETM+ remote sensing imagery of the study area of Vadodara, India. Atmospheric correction is generally applied on satellite images as a part of the preprocessing task in remote sensing applications. In this study, the atmospheric path radiance derived from the atmospheric correction task was experimented with for estimating the amount of PM10 and SO2 using prediction modeling. The traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) and the artificial neural network (ANN) modeling were applied on the processed remote sensing data, and the results thus obtained were assessed using independent test data. The correlation coefficient (R) for the prediction modeling of PM10 was 0.78 for the MLR and 0.72 for ANN algorithms, respectively. For the SO2 estimation, the correlation coefficient (R) was 0.77 and 0.69 for MLR and ANN models, respectively. The test data were evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), which was 36.90 and 24.54 using MLR and ANN modeling, respectively for PM10 and SO2 modeling. During the estimation modeling for SO2, the RMSE was 2.70 and 4.19 for MLR and ANN, respectively. The results confirmed the feasibility of the atmospheric-correction-based prediction modeling of PM10 and SO2. Comparison of the prediction outcomes of MLR and ANN modeling showed that ANN provides better results than the classical regression-based prediction model. Using MLP, the test data prediction error (RMSE) was reduced by 33.50% for PM10 and 34.93% for SO2 over the RMSE reported by MLR estimation.

Due to which more than 4.2 million deaths occur every year. Therefore, prediction of air quality is a subject worth in-depth research and has received substantial interest in the recent years from academic units and the government. Feature selection methods are applied before prediction to identify potentially significant predictors based on exploratory data analysis. In this research work, a feature selection method based on Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO) named Correlation based Adaptive LASSO (CbAL) Regression method has been proposed for predicting the air quality. For the experimental evaluation, cross regional data, including the concentration of pollutants and the meteorological factors of Delhi and its surrounding cities, has been taken from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) Website. Further, to validate this feature selection method, various machine learning techniques have been taken into consideration and some preventive measures have been suggested to enhance the air quality. Feature selection analysis reveals that carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and Ozone are the most important factors for forecasting the air quality and the pollutants found in the cities of Noida and Gurugram have a more substantial impact on the Air Quality Index of Delhi than other surrounding cities. The model evaluation depicts that the feature subset extracted by the proposed method performs better than the complete dataset and the subset extracted by LASSO Regression with an average classification accuracy of 78%.

Specifically, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) constitute a significant breakthrough in understanding the complex sequential behavioral dependencies of the time series. Further, LSTM models justify well with the speedÂaccuracy tradeoff, among other deep learning models. However, there are several limitations of such deep learning models. Firstly, the addition of multiple hidden layers, on the one hand, improves the performance but, on the other hand, requires extensive hardware and computation capabilities. Secondly, most of the previous works that utilized LSTMs for air quality forecasting do not consider the issue of optimal hyperparameter calibration. While deciding the gradient, network learning parameters should be so fixed such that the model does not underfit or overfit. To address these issues, a stochastic optimization algorithm, mimicking the pattern of flocking birds, is utilized to find the most fitting solution in the parameter search space. Particle swarm optimization setup primarily models varying particles representing parameters to reach an optimum state. Furthermore, the Spatio-temporal instabilities of LSTM models are addressed in this work using preprocessing, segmentation and feature engineering to understand seasonal and trend characteristics along with the Spatio-temporal correlation of the time series. The proposed model is employed on the air quality dataset of 15 locations in India. A variety of experiments are performed to prove the superiority of the proposed method. Firstly, a comparison with traditional sequential models and deep learning models is done. Secondly, results are further evaluated over several existing benchmark dataset samples.

Moreover, the spatiotemporal resolution of air pollution modelling approaches must be improved in order to achieve more accurate estimates. If not, the exposure assessments will not be applicable in future health risk assessments. To deal with this challenge, this study featured Land-Use Regression (LUR) models that use machine learning to assess the spatial-temporal variability of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Daily average NO2 data was collected from 70 fixed air quality monitoring stations, belonging to the Taiwanese EPA, on the main island of Taiwan. Around 0.41 million observations from 2000 to 2016 were used for the analysis. Several datasets were employed to determine spatial predictor variables, including the EPA environmental resources dataset, the meteorological dataset, the land-use inventory, the landmark dataset, the digital road network map, the digital terrain model, MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index database, and the power plant distribution dataset. Regarding analyses, conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR were performed first to identify important predictor variables. A Deep Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms were then used to fit the prediction model based on the variables selected by the LUR models. Lastly, data splitting, 10-fold cross validation, external data verification, and seasonal-based and county-based validation methods were applied to verify the robustness of the developed models. The results demonstrated that the proposed conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR models captured 65% and 78%, respectively, of NO2 variation. When the XGBoost algorithm was further incorporated in LUR and hybrid-LUR, the explanatory power increased to 84% and 91%, respectively. The Hybrid Kriging-LUR with XGBoost algorithm outperformed all other integrated methods. This study demonstrates the value of combining Hybrid Kriging-LUR model and an XGBoost algorithm to estimate the spatial-temporal variability of NO2 exposure.

PM10 is one of the main components of air pollutants, which significantly impacts human health, environment, and regional or global climate.

The DF model combines the advantages of deep neural networks and tree models, which can provide model interpretability. Combined with the Himawari-8 AOD, meteorological, and auxiliary factors, the hourly PM10 concentration in China (spatial resolution: 0.05 Ã 0.05Â°) was obtained. The results show that AOD has the highest contribution to the importance of features in the AOD-PM10 model, accounting for approximately 13.5%, and the contributions of boundary layer height, temperature, and relative humidity to the importance of features were 11%, 8.6%, and 7%, respectively. A 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the model. The hourly cross validation results from 09:00 to 16:00 (Beijing time) show that the R2 range was 0.82Â0.88, and the root mean square error and absolute mean error were 18.55Â23.12 ?g/mÂ³ and 11.54Â16.82 ?g/mÂ³, respectively. The R2 values of daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual average PM10 estimated by the model were 0.87, 0.91, 0.94, and 0.94, respectively. The areas with high PM10 concentrations are mainly in northern China, especially in the North China Plain, and the peak value of daily average PM10 can reach 91 ?g/mÂ³; the Intraday variation of PM10 in southern China ranges from 67 ?g/mÂ³ to 72 ?g/mÂ³. A large-scale dust weather process was analyzed. Based on the AOD-PM10 model, the contribution of long-range transport dust to PM10 in China and Northern China were 25.6% and 38.1%, respectively.

Leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs using optical gas imaging (OGI)-based surveys are routinely used to mitigate fugitive emissions or leaks. Recently, new technologies and platforms such as planes, drones, and satellites promise more cost-effective mitigation than existing approaches. To be approved for use in LDAR programs, new technologies must demonstrate emissions mitigation equivalent to existing approaches. In this work, we use the FEAST modeling tool to (a) identify cost vs mitigation trade-offs that arise from using new technologies and (b) provide a framework for effective design of alternative LDAR programs. We identify several critical insights. First, LDAR programs can trade sensitivity for speed without sacrificing mitigation outcomes. Second, low sensitivity or high detection threshold technologies have an effective upper bound on achievable mitigation that is independent of the survey frequency. Third, the cost effectiveness of tiered LDAR programs using site-level detection technologies depends on their ability to distinguish leaks from routine venting. Finally, ""technology equivalence""based on mitigation outcomes differs across basins and should be evaluated independently.

Increasing fossil fuel consumption, which causes climate change, has accelerated the emissions of PAHs. However, potential risks by PAHs have not been predicted for Korea, and appropriate PAH regulations under climate change have yet to be developed. This study assesses the potential risks posed by PAHs using climate change scenarios based on deep learning, and a multimedia fugacity model was employed to describe the future fate of PAHs. The multimedia fugacity model describes the dynamics of sixteen PAHs by reflecting inter-regional meteorological transportation. A deep neural network predicts future environmental and economic conditions, and the potential risks posed by PAHs, in the year 2050, using a prediction model and climate change scenarios. The assessment indicates that cancer risks would increase by more than 50%, exceeding the lower risk threshold in the southern and western regions. A mix of strategies for developing PAH regulatory policies highlighted the necessity of increasing PAHs monitoring stations and controlling fossil fuel usage based on the domestic and global conditions under climate change scenarios.

We have taken a typical machine learning approach using an artificial neural network (ANN), to predict the emission behaviors of VOCs from furniture. The gas-phase VOC concentrations from four kinds of furniture (solid wood furniture, panel furniture, soft leather furniture, soft cloth furniture) were measured in a 1 m3 chamber at different temperatures, relative humidity and ventilation rates. We then used these VOC concentration data as input for training. The trained ANN model could then be used to predict VOC concentrations at other emission time. We selected a back-propagation neural network, with 3 hidden layers, and a learning rate of 0.01. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between the input datasets. We used relative deviation (RD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as the criteria for evaluating the performance of the ANN. For all of the tested VOCs from different types of furniture, the RDs between the predictions and experimental data at 150 h, are less than 15%. The MAPE values of the ANN model are within 10%. These indicate that the trained ANN model has excellent capability in predicting the VOC concentrations from furniture. The main merit of the ANN is that it doesn't need to solve the challenging problem of obtaining the key parameters when using physical models for prediction, and will thus be very useful for indoor source characterization, as well as for exposure assessment.

However, simultaneous and quantitative analysis of multiple constituents in a single aerosol particle with the noncontact in situ manner is still a challenging task. In this work, we explore the laser trapping-LIBS-machine learning to analyze four elements (Zn, Ni, Cu, and Cr) absorbed in a single micro-carbon black particle in air. By employing a hollow laser beam for trapping, the particle can be restricted in a range as small as ?1.72 ?m, which is much smaller than the focal diameter of the flat-topped LIBS exciting laser (?20 ?m). Therefore, the particle can be entirely and homogeneously radiated, and the LIBS spectrum with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is correspondingly achieved. Then, two types of calibration models, i.e., the univariate method (calibration curve) and the multivariate calibration method (random forests (RF) regression), are employed for data processing. The results indicate that the RF calibration model shows a better prediction performance. The mean relative error (MRE), relative standard deviation (RSD), and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) are reduced from 0.1854, 363.7, and 434.7 to 0.0866, 179.8, and 216.2 ppm, respectively. Finally, simultaneous and quantitative determination of the four metal contents with high accuracy is realized based on the RF model. The method proposed in this work has the potential for online single aerosol particle analysis and further provides a theoretical basis and technical support for the precise prevention and control of composite air pollution.

Further, the evidence is growing about the health impacts from these events which are also difficult to simulate. Therefore, we simulated air quality conditions using a suite of remotely-sensed data, surface observational data, chemical transport modeling with WRF-CMAQ, one data fusion, and three machine learning methods to arrive at datasets useful to air quality and health impact analyses. To demonstrate these analyses, we estimated the health impacts from smoke impacts during wildfires in October 8Â20, 2017, in Northern California, when over 7 million people were exposed to Unhealthy to Very Unhealthy air quality conditions. We investigated using the 5-min available GOES-16 fire detection data to simulate timing of fire activity to allocate emissions hourly for the WRF-CMAQ system. Interestingly, this approach did not necessarily improve overall results, however it was key to simulating the initial 12-hr explosive fire activity and smoke impacts. To improve these results, we applied one data fusion and three machine learning algorithms. We also had a unique opportunity to evaluate results with temporary monitors deployed specifically for wildfires, and performance was markedly different. For example, at the permanent monitoring locations, the WRF-CMAQ simulations had a Pearson correlation of 0.65, and the data fusion approach improved this (Pearson correlationÂ =Â 0.95), while at the temporary monitor locations across all cases, the best Pearson correlation was 0.5. Overall, WRF-CMAQ simulations were biased high and the geostatistical methods were biased low. Finally, we applied the optimized PM2.5 exposure estimate in an exposure-response function. Estimated mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure during the smoke episode was 83 (95% CI: 0, 196) with 47% attributable to wildland fire smoke. Implications: Large wildfires in the United States and in particular California are becoming increasingly common. Associated with these large wildfires are air quality and health impact to millions of people from the smoke. We simulated air quality conditions using a suite of remotely-sensed data, surface observational data, chemical transport modeling, one data fusion, and three machine learning methods to arrive at datasets useful to air quality and health impact analyses from the October 2017 Northern California wildfires. Temporary monitors deployed for the wildfires provided an important model evaluation dataset. Total estimated regional mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure during the smoke episode was 83 (95% confidence interval: 0, 196) with 47% of these deaths attributable to the wildland fire smoke. This illustrates the profound effect that even a 12-day exposure to wildland fire smoke can have on human health.

Previous studies have shown that machine-learned atmospheric chemical solvers can be orders of magnitude faster than traditional integration methods but tend to suffer from numerical instability. Here, we present a modeling framework that reduces error accumulation compared to previous work while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach is novel in that it (1) uses a recurrent training regime that results in extended (&gt;1Â week) simulations without exponential error accumulation and (2) can reversibly compress the number of modeled chemical species by &gt;80% without further decreasing accuracy. We observe an ~260Ã speedup (~1,900Ã with specialized hardware) compared to the traditional solver. We use random initial conditions in training to promote general applicability across a wide range of atmospheric conditions. For ozone (concentrations ranging from 0Â70Â ppb), our model predictions over a 24-hr simulation period match those of the reference solver with median error of 2.7 and &lt;19Â ppb error across 99% of simulations initialized with random noise. Error can be significantly higher in the remaining 1% of simulations, which include extreme concentration fluctuations simulated by the reference model. Results are similar for total particulate matter (median error of 16 and &lt;32Â ?g/m3 across 99% of simulations with concentrations ranging from 0Â150Â ?g/m3).

Traditional numerical air quality models require a high computational cost associated with running large-scale numerical simulations. In this work, we introduce a hybrid model (VAE-GAN) combining a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn the dynamic ozone distributions in spatial and temporal spaces. The VAE-GAN model can not only decipher the complex nonlinear relationship between the inputs (the past states/ozone and meteorological factors) and outputs (ozone), but also provide ozone forecasts for a long lead-time beyond the training period. The performance of VAE-GAN is demonstrated in hourly and daily spatio-temporal ozone forecasts over China. The training datasets from 2013 to 2017 and validation datasets from 2018 to 2019 are the collection of data from the air quality reanalysis datasets. With the use of VAE, large dataset sizes are decreased by three orders of magnitude, enabling hourly and daily forecasts to be computed in seconds. Results show that the VAE-GAN achieves a reasonable accuracy in the prediction of both the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of hourly and daily ozone fields, as compared to the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (commonly used in China), the reanalysis data and observations during the validation period. Thus, the VAE-GAN is a cost-effective tool for large data-driven predictions, which can potentially reinforce air pollution prediction efforts in providing risk assessment and management in a timely manner.

Several countries have implemented monitoring stations to collect air pollution particle data and meteorological information using parameters such as hourly timespans. This research focuses on unravelling a new framework for air quality prediction worldwide and features Busan, South Korea as its model city. The paper proposes the application of an attention-based convolutional BiLSTM autoencoder model. The proposed deep learning model has been trained on a distributed framework, referred to data parallelism, to forecast the intensity of particle pollution (PM2.5 and PM10). The algorithm automatically learns the intrinsic correlation among the particle pollution in different locations. Each locationÂs meteorological and traffic data is extensively exploited to improve the modelÂs performance. The model has been trained using air quality particle data and car traffic information. The traffic information is obtained by a device which counts cars passing a specific area through the YOLO algorithm, and then sends the data to a stacked deep autoencoder to be encoded alongside the meteorological data before the final prediction. In addition, multiple one-dimensional CNN layers are used to obtain the local spatial features jointly with a stacked attention-based BiLSTM layer to figure out how air quality particles are correlated in space and time. The evaluation of the new attention-based convolutional BiLSTM autoencoder model was derived from data collected and retrieved from comprehensive experiments conducted in South Korea. The results not only show that the framework outperforms the previous models both on short-and long-term predictions but also indicate that traffic information can improve the accuracy of air quality forecasting. For instance, during PM2.5 prediction, the proposed attention-based model obtained the lowest MAE (5.02 and 22.59, respectively, for short-term and long-term prediction), RMSE (7.48 and 28.02) and SMAPE (17.98 and 39.81) among all the models, which indicates strong accuracy between observed and predicted values. It was also found that the newly proposed model had the lowest average training time compared to the baseline algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed framework was successfully deployed in a cloud server in order to provide future air quality information in real time and when needed. Â© 2022 by the authors.

While accurately monitoring and forecasting air pollution are highly crucial, existing data-driven models have yet fully captured the complex interactions between the temporal characteristics of air pollution and the spatial characteristics of urban dynamics. Our proposed Deep-AIR fills this gap to provide fine-grained city-wide air pollution estimation and station-wide forecast, by exploiting domain-specific features (including Air Pollution, Weather, Urban Morphology, Transport, and Time-sensitive features), with a hybrid CNN-LSTM structure to capture the spatio-temporal features, and $1 imes 1$ convolution layers to enhance the learning of temporal and spatial interaction.

Saliency analysis reveals that for Hong Kong, spatial features, including street canyon and road density, are the best predictors for NO2, while temporal features, including historical air pollutants and weather, are the best predictors for PM2.5. For Beijing, historical air pollutant data, traffic congestion, wind direction and seasonal indicator are the best predictors for all pollutants. PM10 in Hong Kong is achieving the best estimation and forecast accuracy, whilst CO in Beijing is achieving the best results.

The main objective of this study is to establish and evaluate an alternative LUR model that is capable of estimate the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases, in contrast with traditional LUR models, which typically assess air pollutants. Moreover, this study also evaluates different analytic techniques (multiple linear regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, and random forest regression) that often form the basis of spatial models. The results show that machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine, are the most effective in computing such models, presenting the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE).

Yet scenario optimization for large-scale applications is limited by the computational expense of optimization over many control factors. In this study, a multi-pollutant cost-benefit optimization system based on a genetic algorithm (GA) in machine learning has been developed to provide cost-effective air quality control strategies for large-scale applications (e.g., solution spaces of ~1035). The method was demonstrated by providing optimal cost-benefit control pathways to attain air quality goals for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. The GA was found to be &gt;99% more efficient than the commonly used grid searching method while providing the same combination of optimized multi-pollutant control strategies. The GA method can therefore address air quality management problems that are intractable using the grid searching method. The annual attainment goals for PM2.5 (&lt; 35 ?g m?3) and O3 (&lt; 80 ppb) can be achieved simultaneously over the PRD region and surrounding areas by reducing NOx (22%), volatile organic compounds (VOCs, 12%), and primary PM (30%) emissions. However, to attain stricter PM2.5 goals, SO2 reductions (&gt; 9%) are needed as well. The estimated benefit-to-cost ratio of the optimal control strategy reached 17.7 in our application, demonstrating the value of multi-pollutant control for cost-effective air quality management in the PRD region.

In our paper, particulate matter less than 2.5 ?m (PM2.5) air pollution data obtained by community scientists while cycling is used to develop high-resolution spatial air pollution maps. Mapping is completed using a land use regression model for Charlotte, North Carolina. The air pollution observations were obtained with a low-cost sensor. We evaluated the accuracy of the sensor through a collocation study for 3203 h, which identified the sensor had a mean bias of 7.25 ?g/m3 and a correlation of r = 0.77 with an US EPA Federal Equivalent Monitor. A machine learning model was developed to adjust the sensor observations, which demonstrated their highest errors during periods of high humidity. The adjustment was able to reduce the root mean squared error from 12 ?g/m3 to 3.8 ?g/m3, and the mean bias was reduced to ?0.5 ?g/m3. Cycling times were not balanced throughout the day nor the year. We applied a temporal adjustment algorithm to account for this imbalance in observation periods with the intention of producing long-term estimates representing the sampling period of 2016 and 2017. The long-term air pollution surface for the city was generated with a land use regression model. Both linear regression and machine learning approaches were applied. The linear regression model performed poorly with a training R2 of 0.15 and a cross-validation R2 of 0.15. A stacked ensemble model was developed using machine learning, which had a training 5-fold cross-validation mean residual deviance of 3.82 ?g/m3, a root mean squared error of 1.95 ?g/m3, and a mean absolute error of 0.95 ?g/m3.

Excessive emission of particulate matter to ambient air has negatively impacted the health and well-being of human society. Therefore, accurate forecasting of air pollutant concentration is crucial to mitigate the associated health risk. This study aims to predict the hourly PM2.5 concentration for an urban area in Malaysia using a hybrid deep learning model. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) was employed to decompose the original sequence data of particulate matter into several subseries. Long short-term memory (LSTM) was used to individually forecast the decomposed subseries considering the influence of air pollutant parameters for 1-h ahead forecasting. Then, the outputs of each forecast were aggregated to obtain the final forecasting of PM2.5 concentration. This study utilized two air quality datasets from two monitoring stations to validate the performance of proposed hybrid EEMD-LSTM model based on various data distributions. The spatial and temporal correlation for the proposed dataset were analysed to determine the significant input parameters for the forecasting model. The LSTM architecture consists of two LSTM layers and the data decomposition method is added in the data pre-processing stage to improve the forecasting accuracy. Finally, a comparison analysis was conducted to compare the performance of the proposed model with other deep learning models.

Effective prediction of demand for healthcare services, particularly those associated with peak events of CVDs, can be useful in optimizing the allocation of medical resources. However, few studies have attempted to adopt machine learning approaches with excellent predictive abilities to forecast the healthcare demand for CVDs. This study aims to develop and compare several machine learning models in predicting the peak demand days of CVDs admissions using the hospital admissions data, air quality data and meteorological data in Chengdu, China from 2015 to 2017. Methods: Six machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) were applied to build the predictive models with a unique feature set. The area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), logarithmic loss function, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score were used to evaluate the predictive performances of the six models. Results: The LightGBM model exhibited the highest AUC (0.940, 95% CI: 0.900-0.980), which was significantly higher than that of LR (0.842, 95% CI: 0.783-0.901), SVM (0.834, 95% CI: 0.774-0.894) and ANN (0.890, 95% CI: 0.836-0.944), but did not differ significantly from that of RF (0.926, 95% CI: 0.879-0.974) and XGBoost (0.930, 95% CI: 0.878-0.982). In addition, the LightGBM has the optimal logarithmic loss function (0.218), accuracy (91.3%), specificity (94.1%), precision (0.695), and F1 score (0.725). Feature importance identification indicated that the contribution rate of meteorological conditions and air pollutants for the prediction was 32 and 43%, respectively. Conclusion: This study suggests that ensemble learning models, especially the LightGBM model, can be used to effectively predict the peak events of CVDs admissions, and therefore could be a very useful decision-making tool for medical resource management.

Special attention was paid to comparing three predictor options representing the traffic volume: we included acoustic sound measurements (sound), the total number of vehicles (traffic), and the hour of the day and the day of the week (time) as input variables and then compared their prediction powers. The models were trained, validated and tested to evaluate their performance. Results showed that the predictions of the gaseous air pollutants NO, NO2, NOx, and O3 reveal very good agreement with observations, whereas predictions for particle concentrations and NH3 were less successful, indicating that these models can be improved.

However, the existing machine learning prediction methods of air quality fail to analyze the reasons for the change of air pollution concentration because most of the prediction methods take more focus on the model selection. Since the framework of recent deep learning is very flexible, the model may be deep and complex in order to fit the dataset. Therefore, overfitting problems may exist in a single deep neural network model when the number of weights in the deep neural network model is large. Besides, the learning rate of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) treats all parameters equally, resulting in local optimal solution. In this paper, the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to analyze the inherent correlation of PM2.5 and other auxiliary data such as meteorological data, season data, and time stamp data which are applied to cluster for enhancing the performance. Extracted features are helpful to build a deep ensemble network (EN) model which combines the recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to predict the PM2.5 concentration of the next hour. The weights of the submodel change with the accuracy of them in the validation set, so the ensemble has generalization ability. The adaptive moment estimation (Adam) an algorithm for stochastic optimization is used to optimize the weights instead of SGD. In order to compare the overall performance of different algorithms, the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as accuracy metrics in the experiments of this study. The experiment results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy rate (i.e., MAE=6.19 and MAPE=16.20%) and outperforms the comparative models.

Recently, previous studies have conducted extensive research on air pollution and air quality monitoring. Despite this, the fields of air pollution and air quality monitoring remain plagued with unsolved problems. In this study, the Pollution Weather Prediction System (PWP) is proposed to perform air pollution prediction for outdoor sites for various pollution parameters. In the presented research work, we introduced a PWP system configured with pollution-sensing units, such as SDS021, MQ07-CO, NO2-B43F, and Aeroqual Ozone (O3). These sensing units were utilized to collect and measure various pollutant levels, such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and O3, for 90 days at Symbiosis International University, Pune, Maharashtra, India. The data collection was carried out between the duration of December 2019 to February 2020 during the winter. The investigation results validate the success of the presented PWP system. In the conducted experiments, linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN)-based AQI (air quality index) predictions were performed. Furthermore, the presented study also found that the customized linear regression methodology outperformed other machine-learning methods, such as linear, ridge, Lasso, Bayes, Huber, Lars, Lasso-lars, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and ElasticNet regression methodologies, and the customized ANN regression methodology used in the conducted experiments. The overall AQI values of the air pollutants were calculated based on the summation of the AQI values of all the presented air pollutants.

Recent popularity of IoT and machine learning techniques could provide enabling technologies for collecting real-time big data and analyzing them for more accurate prediction of allergic disease risks for evidence-based intervention, but the effort is still in its infancy. This pilot study explored and evaluated the feasibility of a deep learning algorithm for predicting asthma risk. It is based on peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) of 14 pediatric asthma patients visiting the Korea University Medical Center and indoor particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 concentration data collected at their residence every 10 minutes using a PM monitoring device with a low-cost sensor between September 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018. We interpolated the PEFR results collected twice a day for each patient throughout the day so that it can be matched to the PM and other weather data. The PEFR results were classified into three categories such as 'Green' (normal), 'Yellow' (mild to moderate exacerbation) and 'Red' (severe exacerbation) with reference to their best peak flow value. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was trained using the first 10 months of the linked data and predicted asthma risk categories for the next 2 months during the study period. LSTM model is found to predict the asthma risk categories better than multinomial logistic (MNL) regression as it incorporates the cumulative effects of PM concentrations over time. Upon successful modifications of the algorithm based on a larger sample, this approach could potentially play a groundbreaking role for the scientific data-driven medical decision making.

This study aims to examine the association between long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and obesity-related traits in Chinese adults. Thus, a cross-sectional study was conducted based on a nationally representative sample of 91, 121 adults from 31 provinces in China. Integrated the data from satellites, chemical transport model, and ground observations, annual average concentrations of PM2.5 was obtained at the township level using a machine learning method. The information on body weight, height, and waist circumference (WC) were obtained from a questionnaire survey. The general obesity and abdominal obesity status were classified based on body mass index (BMI) and WC, respectively. Logistic and multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the association between PM2.5 and obesity-related traits, along with the examination of potential effect modifications. After adjustment for covariates, a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with 8.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0%, 10.0%] and 10% (95% CI: 9.0%, 11.0%) increases in odds for general obesity and abdominal obesity, respectively. The odds ratios associated with per 10 mu g/m(3) PM2.5 increase were significantly greater in individuals of older age (>= 60 years), of Han ethnicity, with lower socioeconomic status (SES), cooking without using a ventilation device, using unclean household fuels, having near-home pollution sources, and doing no physical exercise. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 increase obesity risk in Chinese adults.

We sought to estimate the relationship between long-term exposure to the fine (diameter < 2.5 mu m) particulate matter component of air pollution and the risk of papillary thyroid cancer. Methods: Adult (age >= 18) patients with newly diagnosed papillary thyroid carcinoma between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2016 across a single health system were identified using electronic medical records. Data from 1,990 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma were compared with 3,980 age-and sex-matched control subjects without any evidence of thyroid disease. Cumulative fine (diameter <2.5 mu m) particulate matter exposure was estimated by incorporating patients' residential zip codes into a deep learning neural networks model, which uses both meteorological and satellite-based measure-ments. Conditional logistic regression was performed to assess for association between papillary thyroid carcinoma and increasing fine (diameter <= 2.5 mu m) particulate matter concentrations over 1, 2, and 3 years of cumulative exposure preceding papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnosis. Results: Increased odds of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma was associated with a 5 mu g/m(3) in-crease of fine (diameter <= 2.5 mu m) particulate matter concentrations over 2 years (adjusted odds ratio = 1.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.40) and 3 years (adjusted odds ratio = 1.23, 95% confidence in-terval: 1.05-1.4 4) of exposure. This risk differed by smoking status (pinteraction = 0.04). Among current smokers (n = 623), the risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma was highest (adjusted odds ratio = 1.35, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-1.63). Conclusion: Increasing concentration of fine (diameter <= 2.5 mu m) particulate matter in air pollution is significantly associated with the incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma with 2 and 3 years of exposure. Our novel findings provide additional insight into the potential associations between risk factors and papillary thyroid carcinoma and warrant further investigation, specifically in areas with high levels of air pollution both nationally and internationally.

While roadside vegetation barriers can help mitigate TRAP, their effectiveness to reduce TRAP is influenced by site-specific conditions. To test vegetation designs using direct field measurements or high-fidelity numerical simulations is often infeasible since urban planners and local communities often lack the access and expertise to use those tools. There is a need for a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use method to evaluate vegetation barrier designs based on their capacity to mitigate TRAP. In this paper, we investigated five machine learning (ML) methods, including linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and neural networks (NN), to predict size-resolved and locationally dependent particle concentrations downwind of various vegetation barrier designs. Data from 33 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations was used to train and test the ML models. We developed downwind region-specific models to capture the complexity of this problem and enhance the overall accuracy. Our feature space was composed of variables that can be feasibly obtained such as vegetation width, height, leaf area index (LAI), particle size, leaf area density (LAD) and wind speed at different heights. RF, NN, and XGB performed well with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 6-7% and an average test R-2 value >0.91, while SVM and LR had an NRMSE of approximately 13% and an average test R-2 value of 0.56. Using feature selection, vegetation dimensions and particle size had the highest influence in predicting pollutant concentrations. The ML models developed can help create tools to aid local communities in developing mitigation strategies to address TRAP problems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to identify the threshold values that reverse the beneficial effects of PA on lung function. Methods: This multistage probability sampling study examined 13,032 individuals aged >= 45 years across China from 2011 to 2015. City-level particulate matter 2.5 mu m or less in diameter (PM2.5) were estimated based on a two-stage machine learning model, with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees. We assessed PA and a range of covariates using standardized self-reported questionnaires. The peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured using a peak flow meter. We used mixed-effects linear regression models to examine the associations between PA and PM2.5, and their interactions with PEF. Results: Participants were 60.4 +/- 9.4 years old [mean +/- standard deviation (SD)]. The mean +/- SD of PM2.5 and PEF was 54.4 +/- 23.0 mu g/m(3) and 273 +/- 116 L/min, respectively. Each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 1.27 L/min decrease in PEF. The PEF increased by 2.48 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.40, 4.55) L/min, 0.74 (95% CI: -1.17, 2.66) L/min, and 1.99 (95% CI: 0.001, 3.99) L/min following a 10 h/week increment of walking, moderate intensity PA, and vigorous intensity PA, respectively. Detrimental associations between PM2.5 and PEF outweighed PA benefits for approximate PM2.5 concentrations > 81 mu g/m(3) (95% CI: 58.9, 111) and > 77 mu g/m(3) (95% CI: 39.7, 102) for walking and vigorous intensity PA, respectively. Conclusions: We identified the threshold of ambient PM2.5 above which the beneficial association of PA with lung function may be reversed to an adverse one. Although the threshold may vary across populations and places, the findings suggested that reducing air pollution could enhance the benefits of PA on lung function.",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156138,11,6,No,,,,"Peoples R China,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such an approach could provide a more refined identification and targeting of populations exposed to increased risk from PM2.5. Objective To assess the association between PM2.5 and age-specific mortality risk (ASMR) using disaggregated data at the census tract level and evaluate such association according to census tract SES. Design, Setting, and Participants This nationwide cross-sectional study used a linkage of 3 different data sets. ASMR for the period of 2010 to 2015 was obtained from the National Center for Health Statistic, SES data covering a period from 2006 to 2016 came from the American Community Survey, and mean PM2.5 exposure levels from 2010 to 2015 were derived from well-validated atmospheric chemistry and machine learning models. Data were analyzed in April 2021. Exposures The main exploratory variable was mean census tract-level long-term exposure to PM2.5 from 2010 to 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was census tract-level ASMR. Multilevel models were used to quantify the geographic variation in ASMR at levels of census tract, county, and state. Additional analysis explored the interaction of SES in the association of ASMR with PM2.5 exposure. Results Data from 67 148 census tracts nested in 3087 counties and 50 states were analyzed. The association between exposure to PM2.5 and ASMR varied substantially across census tracts. The magnitude of such association also varied across age groups, being higher among adults and older adults. Census tracts accounted for most of the total geographic variation in mortality risk (range, 77.0%-94.2%). ASMR was higher in deciles with greater PM2.5 concentration. For example, ASMR for age 75 to 84 years was 54.6 per 1000 population higher in the decile with the second-highest PM2.5 concentration than in the decile with the lowest PM2.5 concentration. The ASMR, PM2.5 concentrations, and magnitude of the association between both were higher in the census tracts with the lowest SES. Conclusions and Relevance This cross-sectional study found that census tracts with lower SES presented higher PM2.5 concentrations. ASMR and air pollution varied substantially across census tracts. There was an association between air pollution and ASMR across all age groups in the United States. These findings suggest that equitable public policies aimed at improving air quality are needed and important to increase life expectancy.",JAMA NETWORK OPEN,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.13540,12,6,No,,,,"United States,Brazil,South Korea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unknown the acute effects of ambient air pollutants exposure on male reproductive hormones. The current study, we measured serum levels of reproductive hormone in 2030 blood samples gathered from The Male Reproductive Health in Chongqing College Students (MARHCS) cohort study. We derived a full coverage of ambient air pollutant (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO and O-3) concentrations by employing machine learning algorithms, and used a mixed-effect model to estimate single-day and cumulative effects of air pollutants exposure on serum reproductive hormones. Our results showed that (1) PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were positively associated with estradiol (E-2) in both single and cumulative lag days, but were negatively associated with the ratio of Testosterone/E-2 (the T/E-2 ratio). NO2 was positively associated with estradiol at lag day 2 (95% CI: 0.290, 0.881; corrected P = 0.048) and lag 0-2 days (95% CI: 0.523, 1.337; corrected P = 0.003), with progesterone (P) at lag day 2 and lag day 3 (corrected P < 0.05). There was also a positive association between CO exposure and progesterone at lag day 2. (2) SO2 was inversely associated with E-2 at lag day 3, 4 and lag 0-4 days, and progesterone at lag day 0, 1, 2 and lag 0-1, 0-2, 0-4 days, but positively associated with the T/E-2 ratio at lag day 3, 4 and lag 0-4 days (corrected P < 0.05). O-3 exposure was negatively associated with E-2 at lag day 3 (95% CI: -0.216, -0.074, corrected P = 0.03). (3) No significant associations were found between the cumulative daily average air pollutant exposure of CO, O-3 and hormone outcomes. This study suggests that short-term exposure to air pollutants may thus alter reproductive hormone levels, especially on serum estradiol, progesterone levels and the T/E-2 ratio.

The presence of a high level of air pollutants can cause severe illnesses such as emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or asthma. Air quality prediction helps us to undertake practical action plans for controlling air pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) reflects the degree of concentration of pollutants in a locality. The average AQI was calculated for the various cities in China to understand the annual trends. Furthermore, the air quality index has been predicted for ten major cities across China using five different deep learning techniques, namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Convolutional Neural Network BiLSTM (CNN-BiLSTM), and Convolutional BiLSTM (Conv1D-BiLSTM). The performance of these models has been compared with a machine learning model, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to discover the most efficient deep learning model. The results suggest that the machine learning model, XGBoost, outperforms the deep learning models. While Conv1D-BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM perform well among the deep learning models in the estimation of the air quality index (AQI), RNN and Bi-GRU are the least performing ones.

While satellite-based statistical/machine-learning methods can be used for estimating high-resolution ground-level PM2.5 concentration data, their applications have been hindered by limited accuracy in daily estimates during years without PM2.5 measurements and massive missing values due to satellite retrieval data. To address these issues, we developed a new spatiotemporal high-resolution PM2.5 hindcast modeling framework to generate the full-coverage, daily, 1-km PM2.5 data for China for the period 2000–2020 with improved accuracy. Our modeling framework incorporated information on changes in observation variables between periods with and without monitoring data and filled gaps in PM2.5 estimates induced by satellite data using imputed high-resolution aerosol data. Compared to previous hindcast studies, our method achieved superior overall cross-validation (CV) R2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.90 and 12.94 μg/m3 and significantly improved the model performance in years without PM2.5 measurements, raising the leave-one-year-out CV R2 [RMSE] to 0.83 [12.10 μg/m3] at a monthly scale (0.65 [23.29 μg/m3] at a daily scale). Our long-term PM2.5 estimates show a sharp decline in PM2.5 exposure in recent years, but the national exposure level in 2020 still exceeded the first annual interim target of the 2021 World Health Organization air quality guidelines. The proposed hindcast framework represents a new strategy to improve air quality hindcast modeling and can be applied to other regions with limited air quality monitoring periods.

Many studies have employed traditional statistical models and remote-sensing technologies to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. However, statistical models have shown inconsistency in PM2.5 concentration predictions, while machine learning algorithms have excellent predictive capacity, but little research has been done on the complementary advantages of diverse approaches. The present study proposed the best subset regression model and machine learning approaches, including random tree, additive regression, reduced error pruning tree, and random subspace, to estimate the ground-level PM2.5 concentrations over Dhaka. This study used advanced machine learning algorithms to measure the effects of meteorological factors and air pollutants (NOX, SO2, CO, and O3) on the dynamics of PM2.5 in Dhaka from 2012 to 2020. Results showed that the best subset regression model was well-performed for forecasting PM2.5 concentrations for all sites based on the integration of precipitation, relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, SO2, NOX, and O3. Precipitation, relative humidity, and temperature have negative correlations with PM2.5. The concentration levels of pollutants are much higher at the beginning and end of the year. Random subspace is the optimal model for estimating PM2.5 because it has the least statistical error metrics compared to other models. This study suggests ensemble learning models to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. This study will help quantify ground-level PM2.5 concentration exposure and recommend regional government actions to prevent and regulate PM2.5 air pollution. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Air Quality, Atmosphere and Health",10.1007/s11869-023-01329-w,6,6,Yes,"RT,ADR,RSS,REPT",,No,"Bangladesh,Saudi Arabia,India,China,Egypt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surface PM2.5 and O3 concentrations can be monitored from satellites, but most retrieval methods retrieve PM2.5 or O3 separately and disregard the shared information between the two air pollutants, for example due to common emission sources. Using surface observations across China spanning 2014–2021, we found a strong relationship between PM2.5 and O3 with distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Thus, in this study, we propose a new deep learning model called the Simultaneous Ozone and PM2.5 inversion deep neural Network (SOPiNet), which allows for daily real-time monitoring and full coverage of PM2.5 and O3 simultaneously at a spatial resolution of 5 km. SOPiNet employs the multi-head attention mechanism to better capture the temporal variations in PM2.5 and O3 based on previous days’ conditions. Applying SOPiNet to MODIS data over China in 2022, using 2019–2021 to construct the network, we found that simultaneous retrievals of PM2.5 and O3 improved the performance compared with retrieving them independently: the temporal R2 increased from 0.66 to 0.72 for PM2.5, and from 0.79 to 0.82 for O3. The results suggest that near-real time satellite-based air quality monitoring can be improved by simultaneous retrieval of different but related pollutants.

The number of publications increased sharply after 2017, comprising approximately 75% of the total. Institutions in China and United States contributed half of all publications with most research being conducted by individual groups rather than global collaborations. Cluster analysis revealed four main research topics for the application of ML: chemical characterization of pollutants, short-term forecasting, detection improvement and optimizing emission control. The rapid development of ML algorithms has increased the capability to explore the chemical characteristics of multiple pollutants, analyze chemical reactions and their driving factors, and simulate scenarios.

Using this approach, this study created 0.5 m fine-scale tree canopy products for 472 cities in Brazil and made them freely available to the community. Results showed that the urban tree canopy coverage in Brazil is between 5% and 35%, and the average urban tree canopy cover is approximately 18.68%. The statistical results of these tree canopy maps quantify the nationwide urban tree canopy inequality problem in Brazil. Urban tree canopy coverage from 130 cities that can accommodate approximately 27.22% of the total population is greater than 20%, whereas 342 cities that can accommodate approximately 42% of the total population have tree canopy cover less than 20%.

In this study, we first used decision plot to map out the decision process of the Random Forest (RF) model for a single hourly data set and constructed a framework for analyzing the causes of air pollution using multiple interpretable methods. Permutation importance was used to qualitatively analyze the effect of each variable on PM2.5 concentrations.

However, existing studies have failed to make full use of the spatiotemporal correlations or topological relationships among air quality monitoring networks (AQMN), and hence exhibit low precision in regional prediction tasks. With this consideration, we proposed a novel deep learning-based hybrid model of Res-GCN-BiLSTM combining the residual neural network (ResNet), graph convolutional network (GCN), and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), for predicting short-term regional NO2 and O3 concentrations. Auto-correlation analysis and cluster analysis were first utilized to reveal the inherent temporal and spatial properties respectively. They demonstrated that there existed temporal daily periodicity and spatial similarity in AQMN. Then the identified spatiotemporal properties were sufficiently leveraged, and monitoring network topological information, as well as auxiliary pollutants and meteorology were also adaptively integrated into the model. The hourly observed data from 51 air quality monitoring stations and meteorological data in Shanghai were employed to evaluate it. Results show that the Res-GCN-BiLSTM model was better adapted to the pollutant characteristics and improved the prediction accuracy, with nearly 11% and 17% improvements in mean absolute error for NO2 and O3, respectively compared to the best performing baseline model. Among the three types of monitoring stations, traffic monitoring stations performed the best for O3, but the worst for NO2, mainly due to the impacts of intensive traffic emissions and the titration reaction. These findings illustrate that the hybrid architecture is more suitable for regional pollutant concentration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121075,6,6,Yes,"RESNN,GCN,LSTM",,Yes,"China,United States",prediction,"NO2,O3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various machine learning algorithms have recently been widely used in air quality forecasting studies to predict possible impacts. Training and constructing several machine learning models for different air pollutants, such as NO2, SO2, O3, and CO forecasts, is a time-consuming process that necessitates additional effort for deployment, maintenance, and monitoring. In this paper, an effort has been made to develop a multi-step multi-output multivariate model (a global model) for air quality forecasting, taking into account various parameters such as meteorological conditions, air quality data from urban traffic, residential, and industrial areas, urban space information, and time component for the prediction of NO2, SO2, O3, CO hourly (1 h to 24 h) concentrations. The global forecasting model can anticipate multiple air pollutant concentrations concurrently, based on past concentrations of covariate characteristics. The datasets on air pollution time series were gathered from six HealthyAir air quality monitoring sites in HCMC between February 2021 and August 2022. Darksky weather provided the hourly concentrations of meteorological conditions for the same period. This is the first model built using real-time air quality data for NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 forecasting in HCM city. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, it was evaluated using real data from HealthyAir stations and quantified using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and correlation indices.

Many machine-learning-based retrieval models have been established for estimating various kinds of air pollutants. These methods mainly aimed to estimate a single pollutant (single-pollutant approach). However, different air pollutants interact with each other and are highly correlated. Building a unified model and conducting a joint retrieval of multiple pollutant can make a better use of these connections and improve the model efficiency. This study proposed a physics-informed multi-task deep neural network (phyMTDNN) for the joint retrieval of six main air pollutants, i.e., PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3. The relationships among these pollutants were used to design the physics-informed network structure and loss function. Top-of-atmosphere reflectance which can generate retrieval results at ultrahigh resolution was used as model input. Experiments for mainland China in 2019 showed that the proposed model successfully achieved simultaneous estimation of six air pollutants, with the cross-validated R2 for the six pollutants varying from 0.72 to 0.90. The contrast experiments proved that physics-informed network structure contributed to the most of the model performance improvement. Compared to the single-pollutant approach, phyMTDNN ameliorated the model accuracy on traces gases retrieval. Furthermore, the modeling efficiency was largely improved in that a lot of repetitive work was avoided and modeling method was optimized. The proposed new multiple-pollutant retrieval frame can be applied to various fields for multi-variate retrieval or estimation. © 2022",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159542,6,6,Yes,DNN,,Yes,"China,Hong Kong",estimation,"PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study aims to examine the effect of air pollution on patient's hospital visits for respiratory diseases, particularly Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI). Outpatient hospital visits, air pollution and meteorological parameters were collected from March 2018 to October 2021. Eight machine learning algorithms (Random Forest model, K-Nearest Neighbors regression model, Linear regression model, LASSO regression model, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Regression, X.G. Boost and Deep Neural Network with 5-layers) were applied for the analysis of daily air pollutants and outpatient visits for ARI. The evaluation was done by using 5-cross-fold confirmations. The data was randomly divided into test and training data sets at a scale of 1:2, respectively. Results show that among the studied eight machine learning models, the Random Forest model has given the best performance with R2 = 0.606, 0.608 without lag and 1-day lag respectively on ARI patients and R2 = 0.872, 0.871 without lag and 1-day lag respectively on total patients. All eight models did not perform well with the lag effect on the ARI patient dataset but performed better on the total patient dataset. Thus, the study did not find any significant association between ARI patients and ambient air pollution due to the intermittent availability of data during the COVID-19 period.

Accurate O3 predictions can better help assess its impacts on public health and facilitate the development of effective prevention and control measures. In this study, we used a random forest (RF) model to construct a bias-correction model to correct the bias in the predictions of hourly O3 (O3-1h), daily maximum 8-h O3 (O3-Max8h), and daily maximum 1-h O3 (O3-Max1h) concentrations from the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model in the Yangtze River Delta region. The results show that the RF model successfully captures the nonlinear response relationship between O3 and its influence factors, and has an outstanding performance in correcting the bias of O3 predictions. The normalized mean biases (NMBs) of O3-1h, O3-Max8h, and O3-Max1h decrease from 15.8%, 20.0%, and 17.0.% to 0.5%, −0.8%, and 0.1%, respectively; correlation coefficients increase from 0.78, 0.90, and 0.89 to 0.94, 0.95, and 0.94, respectively. For O3-1h and O3-Max8h, the original CMAQ model shows an obvious bias in the central and southern Zhejiang region, while the RF model decreases the NMB values from 54% to −1% and 34% to −4%, respectively. The O3-1h bias is mainly caused by the bias of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Relative humidity and temperature are also important factors that lead to the bias of O3. For high O3 concentrations, the temperature bias and O3 observations are the major reasons for the discrepancy between the model and the observations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120926,6,6,Yes,RF,,No,China,prediction,O3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PM2.5 pollution has become the most pressing aspect of UB air pollution. Therefore, monitoring and predicting PM2.5 concentration in UB is of great significance for the health of the local people and environmental management. As of yet, very few studies have used models to predict PM2.5 concentrations in UB. Using data from 0:00 on June 1, 2018 to 23:00 on April 30, 2020, we proposed two deep learning models based on Bayesian optimized LSTM (Bayes-LSTM) and CNN-LSTM. We utilized hourly observed data including Himawari8 (H8) aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorology, and PM2.5 concentration as input for prediction of PM2.5 concentrations. The correlation strengths between meteorology, AOD, and PM2.5 was analyzed using the grey correlation analysis method; the comparison of the performance improvement of the model by using the AOD input value was tested, and the performance of these models was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The prediction accuracies of Bayes-LSTM and CNN-LSTM deep learning models were both improved when AOD was included as an input parameter. Improvement of the prediction accuracy of the CNN-LSTM model was particularly enhanced in the non-heating season; in the heating season, the prediction accuracy of the Bayes-LSTM model slightly improved, while the prediction accuracy of the CNN-LSTM model slightly decreased. We propose two novel deep learning models for PM2.5 concentration prediction in UB, Bayes-LSTM, and CNN-LSTM deep learning models.

In this study, a novel integrated forecasting model of the air quality index (AQI) is suggested to carry out reliable prediction, providing useful references for urban air pollution control, public health construction, and residents' travel planning. Firstly, the original data is decomposed by the method of complementary set empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), and the subsequences of different frequencies are formed. Secondly, the fuzzy entropy (FE) algorithm is used to reconstruct the subsequence. Then, the combined forecasting model is established, and different prediction methods are selected for different frequency subsequences. The new high-frequency sequences, low-frequency sequences, and trend sequences are predicted by the whale algorithm optimized long short term neural network (WOA-LSTM) and the extreme learning machine (ELM), respectively. Empirical analysis are carried out with the example of Beijing and Chengdu. The results indicated that: (1) The proposed CEEMD—FE—WOA-LSTM—ELM model effectively integrates the characteristics of the original sequence and has the highest prediction accuracy among all the comparison models. (2) It is necessary to preprocess the data, which can effectively extract data features.

Considering the complexity of air quality prediction and the high-performance advantages of deep learning methods, this paper proposes a second prediction method of air pollutant concentration based on the Kalman-attention-LSTM (Kalman filter, attention and long short-term memory) model. Firstly, an exploratory analysis is made between the actual environmental measurement data from the monitoring site and the first forecast data from the WRF-CMAQ model. An air quality index (AQI) was used as a measure of air pollution degree. Then, the Kalman filter (KF) is used to fuse the actual environmental measurement data from the monitoring site and the first forecast results from the WRF-CMAQ model. Finally, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model with the attention mechanism is used as a single factor prediction model for an AQI prediction. In the prediction of O3 which is the main pollutant affecting the AQI, the results show that the second prediction based on the Kalman-attention-LSTM model features a better fitting effect, compared with the six models. In the first prediction (from the WRF-CMAQ model), for the RNN, GRU, LSTM, attention-LSTM and Kalman-LSTM, SE improved by 83.26%, 51.64%, 43.58%, 45%, 26% and 29%, respectively, RMSE improved by 83.16%, 51.52%, 43.21%, 44.59%, 26.07% and 28.32%, respectively, MAE improved by 80.49%, 56.96%, 46.75%, 49.97%, 26.04% and 27.36%, respectively, and R-Square improved by 85.3%, 16.4%, 10.3%, 11.5%, 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.

Exploring the relationships between drivers and water quality parameters at the regional scale is key in the identification of appropriate actions for the reduction of water pollution. Regional models are the appropriate tool to achieve this, though their development poses relevant challenges because of the complexity and non-linearity of such relationships. Among the available approaches, Machine Learning (ML) is promising because of its capability to detect complex nonlinear relationships and flexibility in the parameterization, which is learned from data. In this work, we developed regional models of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, arsenic, sulfate and chloride concentrations, as well as electrical conductivity, by using two ML algorithms, Random Forest and Deep feed-forward Neural Network, and compared their performances against the standard Linear Regression model. Our results indicate that the two ML algorithms are much more accurate models for such variables than the classical Linear Regression model, with Deep feed-forward Neural Network being the most effective in identifying the reciprocal importance of the drivers and capturing nonlinear relationships between drivers and water quality variables. Our analysis also revealed that the Julian day and year at which the sample was taken surrogate the air temperature in modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen, with only a slight performance reduction. Arsenic, sulfate, and chloride show more complex behaviors in which geogenic and anthropogenic sources are intertwined. Dilution exerts a role chiefly for arsenic concentration, which suggests a non-uniform, in space, geogenic origin for this variable. © 2022 The Authors",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156377,11,6,No,,,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, PM2.5 air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular and respiratory problems. Therefore, air quality management is an essential issue for densely populated cities to reduce or prevent the adverse effects of air pollution. Considering this, reliable models for pre-dicting pollution levels for pollutants like PM2.5 are critical tools for decision-making. For this purpose, this study presents three kinds of deep learning (DL) algorithms (LSTM, RNN, and GRU) that utilize a time-windowing strategy to predict the hourly concentration of PM2.5 in the Istanbul metropolitan. The models were trained and tested using large data sets that envelope air quality parameters (PM2.5, SO2, NO, NO2, NOX, and O3) and meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and air pressure) for about five years. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM+LSTM model performs significantly better with an R2 of 0.98 and 0.97 at the significance level (p < 0.05) for training and test sets compared to other deep learning algorithms. In addition, data for one year from several stations located in nine different districts of Istanbul were used to evaluate the proposed model's generalization ability. As a result, the proposed LSTM+LSTM model has a good generalization ability with an R2 accuracy rate of 0.90 (p < 0.05) and above for all stations and can be used for non-linear, non-stationary multidi-mensional time series data.

Questionnaire information about risk factors and health outcomes was collected. Machine learning derived mean annual concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and mean summer concentrations of O3 (mu g/m3) at residential level (1-km resolution) were used for the period 2013-2015. The associations between the four pollutants and respiratory/allergic symptoms/diseases were assessed using two approaches: a) logistic regression models (single-pollutant models), b) principal component logistic regression models (multipollutant models). All the models were adjusted for age, sex, education level, smoking habits, season of interview, climatic index and included a random intercept for cohorts.Results: the three-year average (+/- standard deviation) pollutants concentrations at residential level were: 20.3 +/- 6.8 mu g/m3 for PM2.5, 29.2 +/- 7.0 mu g/m3 for PM10, 28.0 +/- 11.2 mu g/m3 for NO2, and 70.9 +/- 4.3 mu g/m3 for summer O3.

To govern the status of the atmospheric environment, a novel hybrid model for PM2.5 forecasting was proposed by introducing a two-stage decomposition technology of complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and variational mode decomposition (VMD); subsequently, a deep learning approach of long short-term memory (LSTM) was proposed. Five cities with unique meteorological and economic characteristics were selected to assess the predictive ability of the proposed model. The results revealed that PM2.5 pollution was generally more severe in inland cities (66.98 Â± 0.76 ?g m?3) than in coastal cities (40.46 Â± 0.40 ?g m-3). The modelling comparison showed that in each city, the secondary decomposition algorithm improved the accuracy and prediction stability of the prediction models. When compared with other prediction models, LSTM effectively extracted featured information and achieved relatively accurate time-series prediction. The hybrid model of CEEMDAN-VMD-LSTM achieved a better prediction in the five cities (R2 = 0.9803 Â± 0.01) compared with the benchmark models (R2 = 0.7537 Â± 0.03).

They are critical for the health of pigs, farm workers, and people living nearby. To achieve an accurate estimation of gas emissions, firstly, hybrid deep learning driven sequential Concentration Transport Emission Model (DL-CTEM) was proposed to estimate the emissions of NH3, CO2, and H2S from a pig building. Then, optimal ventilation control strategies were put forward to improve health-related gas concentrations and air pollution from the pig building. Fifty-three days of hourly measurements data were divided into training data and test data for the DL-CTEM. It was shown that the mean errors between the measurements and the predictions of the proposed model for NH3, CO2, and H2S concentrations were 0.1 ppm, 79.2 ppm, and 106.3 ppb, respectively.

It is crucial to realize more accurate predictions of PM2.5 and establish a high-accuracy PM2.5 prediction model due to their social impacts and cross-field applications in geospatial engineering. To further boost the accuracy of PM2.5 prediction results, this paper proposes a new wavelet PM2.5 prediction system (called WD-OSMSSA-KELM model) based on a new, improved variant of the salp swarm algorithm (OSMSSA), kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), wavelet decomposition, and Boruta-XGBoost (B-XGB) feature selection. First, we applied the B-XGB feature selection to realize the best features for predicting hourly PM2.5 concentrations. Then, we applied the wavelet decomposition (WD) algorithm to reach the multi-scale decomposition results and single-branch reconstruction of PM2.5 concentrations to mitigate the prediction error produced by time series data. In the next stage, we optimized the parameters of the KELM model under each reconstructed component. An improved version of the SSA is proposed to reach higher performance for the basic SSA optimizer and avoid local stagnation problems. In this work, we propose new operators based on oppositional-based learning and simplex-based search to mitigate the core problems of the conventional SSA. In addition, we utilized a time-varying parameter instead of the main parameter of the SSA. To further boost the exploration trends of SSA, we propose using the random leaders to guide the swarm towards new regions of the feature space based on a conditional structure. After optimizing the model, the optimized model was utilized to predict the PM2.5 concentrations, and different error metrics were applied to evaluate the modelÂs performance and accuracy. The proposed model was evaluated based on an hourly database, six air pollutants, and six meteorological features collected from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center.

Secondly, MPA-VMD is used to decompose the IMF component with the maximum AAPE. Lastly, ChOA-ELM is used to predict all IMF components, and all prediction results are reconstructed to obtain the final prediction results.

Air quality models are crucial tools for surveying and projecting air pollution episodes, which can be used to issue health advisories to take action ahead of time. Short-term increases in air pollution trigger many adverse health events; a fast, efficient, cost-effective, and reliable air quality prediction model would aid in minimizing the effect on health and prosperity. Deterministic models, on the other hand, are less robust in predicting the pollutant series since it is non-stationary and non-linear. Atmospheric chemistry models are computationally expensive and often rely on outdated emissions information. We propose a deep learning model in this study that integrates neural networks, fuzzy inference systems, and wavelet transforms to predict the most prominent air pollutant affecting Delhi, India i.e., PM2.5 (particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 Âµm). We have included the main aspects of air quality models in this research i.e., less computational time (7 min approximately using I5-1035G1, 1.19 GHz processor), less resource-intensive (dependent only on the pollutant lagged values), and high spatial resolution (1 km) for forecasting air quality three days ahead.

Reduced-order modelling techniques are applied to compress the recorded images into low-dimensional spaces and alleviate the computational cost. Recurrent neural networks are then employed to build a surrogate model of drop interactions by learning the dynamics of compressed variables in the reduced-order space. The surrogate model is integrated with real-time observations using data assimilation. In this paper we developed an ensemble-based latent assimilation algorithm scheme which shows an improvement in terms of accuracy with respect to the previous approaches. This work demonstrates the possibility to create a reliable data-driven model enabling a high fidelity prediction of drop interactions in microfluidics device.

In addition, we used the network method to find the best data sources that provide factors affecting comprehensive air-quality index behaviors. This study had two steps: (1) predicting the six pollutants, including fine dust (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), sulfurous acid gas (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) using the LSTM model; (2) forecasting the CAI using the six predicted pollutants in the first step as predictors of DNNs.

First, using a visibility meter, particle spectrometer, and ground meteorological station data from 2016 to 2019, the principal component analysis method was adopted to determine the influence of atmospheric meteorological and environmental parameters on atmospheric visibility, and an input dataset applicable to atmospheric visibility prediction was constructed. On the basis of deep belief network theory, network structure parameters, including data preprocessing, the number of hidden layers, the number of nodes, and activation and weight functions, are simulated and analyzed. A deep belief network model suitable for atmospheric visibility prediction is established, where a double hidden layer is adopted with the node numbers 70 and 50, and the Z-score method is used for normalization processing with the tanh activation function and Adam optimizer. The average accuracy of atmospheric visibility prediction by the deep belief network reached 0.84, and the coefficient of determination reached 0.96; these results are significantly superior to those of the back propagation (BP) neural network and convolutional neural network (CNN), thus verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the established deep belief network for predicting atmospheric visibility.

Despite their advancements over the past decades, the models exhibit significant model-measurement errors, especially during high concentration episodes. Furthermore, biases within meteorological predictions, emission estimates, initial and boundary conditions, and other model inputs can propagate into the final predictions. This research introduces a new generation of post-processing application for real-time air quality forecasts that employ the physical process of a numerical model in conjunction with an advanced deep learning algorithm. We use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to map ozone precursors from Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and meteorological parameters from the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model (as inputs variables) to observed hourly ozone concentrations at a monitoring station (as a target). Our results show that the CMAQ-CNN model significantly improves the performance of the CMAQ model in both accuracy and bias. The absolute correlation coefficient is improved by 0.16 on average. The CMAQ-CNN model improves simulated ozone peaks for almost all cases and reduces the bias of CMAQ predictions by an average of more than 20 ppb (or 40%). Systematic improvements in CMAQ-CNN simulations suggest that the deep learning model is effective at reproducing accurate estimates of ground-level air quality concentrations. While this study focuses on ozone in the United States and outputs of CMAQ, the proposed approach can be applied to any measured air pollution parameters or numerical model in a mesoscale resolution.

The quality of assessments can be augmented by modelling; however, models are generally less capable of predicting PNC spatial variation than predicting variations in other ambient pollutants. To advance modelling of PNC, we aimed to develop and compare the performance of parametric and non-parametric machine learning land-use regression (LUR) models to predict hourly average PNC. We used data from 25 short-term stationary campaigns and five long-term sites during 2009Â2012 in the Brisbane Metropolitan Area, Australia. We analysed three particle size ranges of total PNC (<30 nm, <414 nm and <3000 nm) as response variables, and over 150 independent variables, including land use, roads and traffic, population, distance, elevation, meteorology and time of day as potential predictors of PNC. The LUR models were developed separately for All Days, Nuc Days (when particle nucleation occurred), and No-nuc Days (when no particle nucleation occurred). We selected two algorithms to develop LUR models for PNC: a random forest (RF) model, and a generalised additive model (GAM) based on the least angle regression (LARS). The best LARS model for <30 nm, <414 nm and <3000 nm explained 30%, 31%, and 34%, respectively, whereas the best RF models were significantly better, explaining 73%, 64%, and 88%, respectively. Using this novel approach, we provided new insights into spatial variation in PNC and also demonstrated that the non-parametric RF model is a better choice for developing a LUR model for PNCs because of its robust predictive performance in comparison with the LARS parametric regression model.

The nitrate ([NO3?]) prediction model could predict ?59% of the atmospheric nitrate concentration. The sensitivity analysis of the input variables in the present model further revealed that NO3? and VOC were two important pollutants dominating the variation trend of PM2.5. It is recommended that decision makers should focus more on the reduction of VOC and O3 to reduce secondary PM2.5 formation during winter in central Taiwan. Real-time measurements of the chemical composition of PM2.5, taken as the regulatory air quality monitoring items are needed in the future.

The measurements of nine meteorological parameters were introduced as independent variables. The goal was to carefully study a limited number of initial predictors and extract stochastic information from them to build an extended set of data that allowed the creation of highly efficient predictive models. Four base models using random forest, CART ensemble and bagging, and their rotation variants, were built and evaluated. The heterogeneity of these base models was achieved by introducing five types of diversities, including a new simplified selective ensemble algorithm. The predictions from the four base models were then used as predictors in multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models. All models were statistically tested using out-of-bag or with 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation. In addition, a variable importance analysis was conducted. The proposed framework was used for short-term forecasting of out-of-sample data for seven days. It was shown that the stacked models outperformed all single base models. An index of agreement IA = 0.986 and a coefficient of determination of about 95% were achieved. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Since 2005, Fujian Province of Mainland China and Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait have both implemented aggressive air pollution control policies designed based on different principles, but a comprehensive evaluation of these control policies on PM2.5pollution levels is still lacking. In the current study, we assessed the effects of these policies in the Taiwan Strait Region from 2005 to 2018 using full-coverage, high-resolution PM2.5generated by a satellite-driven machine learning model. A ten-fold cross-validation for our prediction model showed an R2value of 0.89, demonstrating that these predictions can be used for policy evaluation. During the 14-year period, PM2.5levels in all areas of Fujian and Taiwan underwent a significant decrease. Separate regression models for policy evaluation in Taiwan and Fujian showed that all considered policies have mitigated PM2.5pollution to various degrees. The Clean Air Action Plans (CAAP) is the most effective control policy in Taiwan, while the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) and Three-year Action Plan for Blue Skies (3YAP-BS) as well as their provincial implementation plans are the most successful in Fujian.

These models typically lack microscale variables (e.g., street level), which may improve prediction with fine-spatial gradients. We developed microscale variables of the urban environment including Point of Interest (POI) data, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, and satellite-based measures of urban form. We developed United States national models for six criteria pollutants (NO2, PM2.5, O3, CO, PM10, SO2) using various modeling approaches: Stepwise Regression + kriging (SW-K), Partial Least Squares + kriging (PLS-K), and Machine Learning + kriging (ML-K). We compared predictor variables (e.g., traditional vs microscale) and emerging modeling approaches (ML-K) to well-established approaches (i.e., traditional variables in a PLS-K or SW-K framework). We found that combined predictor variables (traditional + microscale) in the ML-K models outperformed the well-established approaches (10-fold spatial cross-validation (CV) R2 increased 0.02-0.42 [average: 0.19] among six criteria pollutants). Comparing all model types using microscale variables to models with traditional variables, the performance is similar (average difference of 10-fold spatial CV R2 = 0.05) suggesting microscale variables are a suitable substitute for traditional variables.

Both the developed and developing countries are undergoing a high concentration of pollution levels. Fine particulate matter PM2.5 (particles having a diameter less than 2.5 ?m) and PM10 (particles having a diameter less than 10 ?m) can easily penetrate the lungs and respiratory system and causes adverse health issues like heart attacks, cardiovascular diseases, lung function reduction. Real-time pollutant information is of great importance to providing prompt and complete information on air quality. Air pollution forecasting is another significant step of air pollution management, which can help policymakers and citizens make proper decisions to prevent air pollution-related diseases. This research study explores a novel pollutant forecasting model named as Multi-output temporal convolutional network autoencoder (MO-TCNA). The model accumulates each step's predicted values to perform multi-step ahead long-term forecasting for multiple pollutants and multiple sites in a single training model. The MO-TCNA network serves both the PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants forecasting for various locations instead of performing single output and site-specific pollutant forecasting. Consequently, the experimental results show that the MO-TCNA network is time-saving and has better performance than the traditional site-specific forecasting models.

Numerous statistical prediction models have been used to estimate ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants in urban environments, with some incorporating machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve predictive power. However, many ML approaches for predicting ambient pollutant concentrations to date have used principal component analysis (PCA) with traditional regression algorithms to explore linear correlations between variables and to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Moreover, while most urban air quality prediction models have traditionally incorporated explanatory variables such as meteorological, land use, transportation/mobility, and/or co-pollutant factors, recent research has shown that local emissions from building infrastructure may also be useful factors to consider in estimating urban pollutant concentrations. Here we propose an enhanced ML approach for predicting urban ambient PM2.5 concentrations that hybridizes cascade and PCA methods to reduce the dimensionality of the data-space and explore nonlinear effects between variables. We test the approach using different durations of time series air quality datasets of hourly PM2.5 concentrations from three air quality monitoring sites in different urban neighborhoods in Chicago, IL to explore the influence of dynamic human-related factors, including mobility (i.e., traffic) and building occupancy patterns, on model performance. We test 9 state-of-the-art ML algorithms to find the most effective algorithm for modeling intraurban PM2.5 variations and we explore the relative importance of all sets of factors on intraurban air quality model performance. Results demonstrate that Gaussian-kernel support vector regression (SVR) was the most effective ML algorithm tested, improving accuracy by 118% compared to a traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) approach. Incorporating the enhanced approach with SVR algorithm increased model performance up to 18.4% for yearlong and 98.7% for month-long hourly datasets, respectively. Incorporating assumptions for human occupancy patterns in dominant building typologies resulted in improvements in model performance by between 4% and 37%. Combined, these innovations can be used to improve the performance and accuracy of urban air quality prediction models compared to conventional approaches.

Accurate air quality prediction can provide useful information for government decision-making and residents' activities. However, accurately predicting future air quality remains a challenging task because of the complex spatial-temporal dependencies of air quality. Previous studies failed to explicitly model these spatial-temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive spatial-temporal network (SA-STNet) to efficiently and effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of air quality. In order to effectively aggregate spatial information, we employ a self-adaptive graph convolution module that can learn the latent spatial correlations of air quality automatically. In the temporal dimension, we utilise three independent components to capture the recent, daily-periodic, and weekly-periodic temporal dependencies of air quality, respectively. In addition, our model exploits rich external complementary information by means of a features extraction component. A parametric-matrix-based fusion architecture is used to combine the outputs of different components into a joint representation which is used for generating the final prediction results. Extensive experiments carried out on real-world datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model compared with baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

For most chemicals, the inadequacy and uncertainty of chemical-specific data severely limit the application of exposure-and risk-based methods for screening-level assessments, priority setting, and effective management. OBJECTIVE: We developed and evaluated a holistic, mechanistic modeling framework for ecological and human health assessments to support the safe and sustainable production, use, and disposal of organic chemicals. METHODS: We consolidated various models for simulating the PROduction-To-EXposure (PROTEX) continuum with empirical data sets and models for predicting chemical property and use function information to enable high-throughput (HT) exposure and risk estimation. The new PROTEX-HT framework calculates exposure and risk by integrating mechanistic computational modules describing chemical behavior and fate in the socioeconomic system (i.e., life cycle emissions), natural and indoor environments, various ecological receptors, and humans. PROTEX-HT requires only molecular structure and chemical tonnage (i.e., annual production or consumption volume) as input information. We evaluated the PROTEX-HT framework using 95 organic chemicals commercialized in the United States and demonstrated its application in various exposure and risk assessment contexts. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent and 97% of the PROTEX-HT human exposure predictions were within one and two orders of magnitude, respectively, of independent human exposure estimates inferred from biomonitoring data. PROTEX-HT supported screening and ranking chemicals based on various exposure and risk metrics, setting chemical-specific maximum allowable tonnage based on user-defined toxicological thresholds, and identifying the most relevant emission sources, environmental media, and exposure routes of concern in the PROTEX continuum. The case study shows that high chemical tonnage did not necessarily result in high exposure or health risks. CONCLUSION: Requiring only two chemical-specific pieces of information, PROTEX-HT enables efficient screening-level evaluations of existing and premanufacture chemicals in various exposure-and risk-based contexts.

However, the existing frameworks of data analysis are insufficient or inefficient to investigate the potential causality behind the associations involving multidimensional factors and complicated interrelationships. Thus, a causal inference framework equipped with the structural causal model aided by machine learning methods was proposed and applied to examine the potential causal relationships between COVID-19 severity and 10 environmental factors (NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, average air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and wind speed) in 166 Chinese cities. The cities were grouped into three clusters based on the socio-economic features. Time-series data from these cities in each cluster were analyzed in different pandemic phases. The robustness check refuted most potential causal relationshipsÂ estimations (89 out of 90). Only one potential relationship about air temperature passed the final test with a causal effect of 0.041 under a specific cluster-phase condition. The results indicate that the environmental factors are unlikely to cause noticeable aggravation of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also demonstrated the high value and potential of the proposed method in investigating causal problems with observational data in environmental or other fields. Â© 2021 The Authors.

The lack of spatially resolved HONO concentration information results in large knowledge gaps of HONO and its role in atmospheric chemistry and air pollution in China. In this work, an ensemble machine learning model comprising of random forest, gradient boosting, and back propagation neural network was proposed, for the first time, to estimate the long-term (2006Â2017) daily HONO concentrations across China in 0.25Â° resolution. Further, the key factors controlling the space-time variablity of HONO concentrations were analyzed based on variable importance values. The ensemble model well characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of daily HONO concentrations with the sampled-based, site-based and by-year cross-validation (CV) R2 (RMSE) of 0.7 (0.36 ppbv), 0.67 (0.36 ppbv), and 0.62 (0.40 ppbv), respectively.

The national HONO levels stagnated during 2006Â2013, then declined after 2013 benefiting from the implementation of the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control. The NO3? concentration, urban area, NO2 column density ranked as important variables for HONO prediction, while agricultral land, forest and grassland played minor roles in affecting HONO concentrations, suggesting the significant role of heterogeneous HONO production from anthropogenic precursor emissions. Leveraging the ground-level HONO observations, this study fills the gap of statistically modelling nationwide HONO in China, which provides essential data for atmospheric chemistry research.

Therefore, accurate prediction of air quality is crucial for mitigation planning to support urban sustainability and resilience. Although some studies have predicted air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) using machine learning algorithms (MLAs), there is a paucity of studies on spatial hazard assessment with respect to the air quality index (AQI). Incorporating PM in AQI studies is crucial because of its easily inhalable micro-size which has adverse impacts on ecology, environment, and human health. Accurate and timely prediction of the air quality index can ensure adequate intervention to aid air quality management. Therefore, this study undertakes a spatial hazard assessment of the air quality index using particulate matter with a diameter of 10 ?m or lesser (PM10) in Selangor, Malaysia, by developing four machine learning models: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB). Spatially processed data such as NDVI, SAVI, BU, LST, Ws, slope, elevation, and road density was used for the modelling. The model was trained with 70% of the dataset, while 30% was used for cross-validation. Results showed that XGBoost has the highest overall accuracy and precision of 0.989 and 0.995, followed by random forest (0.989, 0.993), K-nearest neighbour (0.987, 0.984), and Naive Bayes (0.917, 0.922), respectively. The spatial air quality maps were generated by integrating the geographical information system (GIS) with the four MLAs, which correlated with MalaysiaÂs air pollution index. The maps indicate that air quality in Selangor is satisfactory and posed no threats to health. Nevertheless, the two algorithms with the best performance (XGBoost and RF) indicate that a high percentage of the air quality is moderate. The study concludes that successful air pollution management policies such as green infrastructure practice, improvement of energy efficiency, and restrictions on heavy-duty vehicles can be adopted in Selangor and other Southeast Asian cities to prevent deterioration of air quality in the future.

We inferred 5,642 weekly activity anomalies from the meteorology-adjusted differences in spaceborne tropospheric NO2 column concentrations after the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak relative to the baseline from 2016 to 2019. Two satellite observations reveal reincreasing economic activity associated with lifting control measures that comes together with accelerating COVID-19 cases before the winter of 2020/2021. Application of the near-real-time satellite NO2 observations produces a much better prediction of the deceleration of COVID-19 cases than applying the Oxford Government Response Tracker, the Public Health and Social Measures, or human mobility data as alternative predictors. A convergent cross-mapping suggests that economic activity reduction inferred from NO2 is a driver of case deceleration in most of the territories. This effect, however, is not linear, while further activity reductions were associated with weaker deceleration. Over the winter of 2020/2021, nearly 1 million daily COVID-19 cases could have been avoided by optimizing the timing and strength of activity reduction relative to a scenario based on the real distribution. Our study shows how satellite observations can provide surrogate data for activity reduction during the COVID-19 pandemic and monitor the effectiveness of containment to the pandemic before vaccines become widely available.

First, a spatial database was created with 872 locations of asthma patients and affecting factors (particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), rainfall, wind speed, humidity, temperature, distance to street, traffic volume, and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)). We created four factors using remote sensing (RS) imagery, including air pollution (O3, SO2, CO, and NO2), altitude, and NDVI. All criteria were prepared using a geographic information system (GIS). For modeling and validation, 70% and 30% of the data were used, respectively. The weight of evidence (WOE) model was used to assess the spatial relationship between the dependent and independent data. Finally, three ensemble algorithms were used to perform asthma?prone areas mapping. According to the Gini index, the most influential factors on asthma occurrence were distance to the street, NDVI, and traffic volume. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for the AdaBoost, Bagging, and Stacking algorithms was 0.849, 0.82, and 0.785, respec-tively. According to the findings, the AdaBoost algorithm outperforms the Bagging and Stacking algorithms in spatial modeling of asthma?prone areas. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Previous studies suffer from inaccurate exposure assessment methods, confounding individual-level variations, and classical analytical modelling. This study aimed to examine the association between maternal exposure to criteria air pollutants and BD risk. A total of 553 cases and 10,214 controls were identified from private and public databases. Two subgroups were then formed: one for a matched case-control design, and another for Feature Selection (FS) analysis. Exposure assessment was based on the mean air pollutant-specific levels in the mother's residential area during the specific BD gestational time window of risk (GTWR) and other time intervals. Multivariate regression models outcomes consistently showed a significant protective effect for folic acid intake and highlighted parental consanguinity as a strong BD risk factor. After adjusting for these putative risk factors and other covariates, results show that maternal exposure to PM2.5 during the first trimester is significantly associated with a higher overall BD risk (OR:1.05, 95%CI:1.01Â1.09), and with a higher risk of genitourinary defects (GUD) (OR:1.06, 95%CI:1.01Â1.11) and neural tube defects (NTD) (OR:1.10, 95%CI:1.03Â1.17) during specific GTWRs. Maternal exposure to NO2 during GTWR exhibited a significant protective effect for NTD (OR:0.94, 95%CI:0.90Â0.99), while all other examined associations were not statistically significant. Additionally, maternal exposure to SO2 during GTWR showed a significant association with a higher GUD risk (OR:1.17, 95%CI:1.08Â1.26). When limiting selection to designated monitor coverage radiuses, PM2.5 maintained significance with BD risk and showed a significant gene-environment interaction for GUD (p = 0.018), while NO2 protective effect expanded to other subtypes. On the other hand, FS analysis confirmed maternal exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 as important features for GUD, CHD, and NTD. Our findings, set the basis for building a novel BD risk prediction model.

However, it is difficult to predict the degree of air pollution of a location by exploiting massive air pollution datasets incorporating data on spatially related locations. Construction of a spatial correlation prediction model for air pollution is therefore required for air pollution big-data mining. In this paper, we propose an air pollution-concentration spatial correlation prediction model based on a fusion deep neural network called FDN-learning. Three models are combined: a stacked anti-autoencoder network, Gaussian function model, and long short-term memory network (LSTM). The FDN-learning model is composed of three layers for feature expansion, intermediate processing, and data prediction. In the first layer, we employ a stacked anti-autoencoder model to learn the source-data spatial features through a feature expansion hidden layer; this can enrich the feature vector and mine more information for further prediction. In the second layer, the Gaussian function evaluates effective weights for the outputs of the stacked anti-autoencoder models in the preceding layer; the spatial correction effects are therefore incorporated in this layer. Finally, the LSTM model in the data prediction layer learns the air pollution-concentration temporal features. A fine-tuning method based on stochastic gradient descent is applied to the FDN-learning model for improved performance. Empirical results are used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed model based on a real-world air pollution dataset.

Many of the models were developed for criteria air pollutants rather than others that have not been regulated (e.g., ultrafine particles, black carbon, and benzene) which may also be harmful to human health. We aim to develop spatial models for regulated and non-regulated air pollutants using 6 algorithms and compare their prediction performances. A mobile platform with fast-response monitors was used to measure gaseous air pollutants (nitrogen dioxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxides, ozone, benzene, toluene, methanol) and particulate matters (black carbon, surface area, count- and volume-concentrations of ultrafine particles) in Beijing, China for 30 days from July to October 2008. Mobile monitoring data for model building were spatially aggregated into 130 road segments of approximately 600-m interval on the sampling routes after temporal adjustment of background concentrations. The best models for the air pollutants were dominated by traffic variables, which explained more than 60% of the spatial variations (range: 0.61 for methanol to 0.88 for ozone) based on the highest cross-validation R2 and the lowest root mean square error among different algorithms. Amongst the 6 algorithms, the spatial models using partial least squares regression (PLS, a dimension reduction algorithm) and random forest (RF, a machine learning algorithm) algorithms outperformed the models with other algorithms. Exposure predictions from the best models varied substantially with distinct spatial patterns between the air pollutants. Predictions with multiple modeling algorithms were moderately correlated with each other for the same pollutant at the fine-scale grids across the city. Exposure models, especially based on PLS and RF algorithms, captured the spatial variation of short-term average concentrations, had adequate predictive validity, and could be applied to assess toxic air pollutant exposures in human health studies.

To confirm recent findings of an association with skin cancer mortality, an updated national radon model is needed. The aim of this study was to derive the best possible residential radon prediction model for subsequent epidemiological analyses. Two different radon prediction models were developed (linear regression model vs. random forest) using ca. 80,000 measurements in the Swiss Radon Database (1994Â2017). A range of geographic predictors and building specific predictors were considered in the 3-D models (x,y, floor of dwelling). A five-fold modelling strategy was used to evaluate the robustness of each approach, with models developed (80% measurement locations) and validated (20%) using standard diagnostics. Random forest consistently outperformed the linear regression model, with higher Spearman's rank correlation (51% vs. 36%), validation coefficient of determination (R2 31% vs. 15%), lower root mean square error (RMSE) and lower fractional bias. Applied to the population of 5.4 million adults in 2000, the random forest resulted in an arithmetic mean (standard deviation) of 75.5 (31.7) Bq/m3, and indicated a respective 16.1% and 0.1% adults with predicted radon concentrations exceeding the World Health Organization (100 Bq/m3) and Swiss (300 Bq/m3) reference values. Residential radon prediction models were developed and validated using a large number of measurements. Machine learning using random forest was found to perform substantially better than the more classical linear regression.

For the purpose of this study, a three-month measurement campaign was performed simultaneously at indoor and outdoor sampling sites of a university building in an urban area of Belgrade (Serbia), during which the concentrations of O3, CO, SO2, NOx, radon, PM2.5 and particle constituents including trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni and Pb), ions (Cl?, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, NO3?, SO42? and NH4+) and 16 US EPA priority PAHs were determined. Additionally, the analysis included 31 meteorological parameters, out of which 24 were obtained from Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS1) database. The Unmix and PAH diagnostic ratios analysis resolved the source profiles for both indoor and outdoor environment, which are comparable in terms of their apportionments and pollutant shares, although it should be emphasized that ratio-implied solutions should be taken with caution since these values do not reflect emission sources only. The highest contributions to air quality were attributed to sources identified as coal combustion and related pyrogenic processes. Noticeable correlations were observed between 5- and 6-ring high molecular weight PAHs, but, except for CO, no significant linear dependencies with other investigated variables were identified.

Although the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a powerful model for predicting dust events, no attempt has been made to investigate its uncertainty and interpretability. In this study, therefore, the uncertainty of the ANFIS model was quantified using uncertainty estimation based on local errors and clustering methods. Furthermore, we used a model-agnostic interpretation to make the ANFIS model interpretable. In addition, we used the bat optimization algorithm (BAT) to increase the prediction accuracy of the ANFIS model. Seven explanatory variables were chosen for predicting DC in the cold and warm months across semi-arid regions of Iran. The results showed that the ANFIS+BAT model increased the correlation coefficient by 10% and 16% for predicting DC in the cold and warm months, respectively, compared with the ANFIS model. Furthermore, the uncertainty analysis indicated a lower prediction interval (i.e., lower uncertainty) for the ANFIS+BAT model compared with the ANFIS model for predicting DC in the cold and warm months. In addition, the model-agnostic interpretation tool findings indicated the highest contributions of air temperature and maximum wind speed for predicting DC in the cold and warm months, respectively. Prediction of DC using the proposed model will allow decision-makers to better plan for measures to mitigate the risks of wind erosion and air pollution.

To mitigate the effects of air pollution, we must first understand it, find its patterns and correlations, and predict it in advance. Air pollution is highly dependent on spatial and temporal correlations of prior meteorological, wildfire, and pollution structures. We use the advanced deep predictive Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model paired with the cutting-edge Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture to predict spatiotemporal hourly PM2.5 across the Los Angeles area over time. Our deep-learning model does not use atmospheric physics or chemical mechanism data, but rather multisource imagery and sensor data. We use high-resolution remote-sensing satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard the NASA Terra+Aqua satellites and remote-sensing data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), a multispectral imaging spectrometer onboard the Sentinel-5P satellite. We use the highly correlated Fire Radiative Power data product from the MODIS instrument which provides valuable information about the radiant heat output and effects of wildfires on atmospheric air pollutants. The input data we use in our deep-learning model is representative of the major sources of ground-level PM2.5 and thus we can predict hourly PM2.5 at unparalleled accuracies.

To achieve this objective, minute-level UFP concentrations were measured at various locations along a major arterial road in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) between February and May 2019. Each location was visited five times, at least once in the morning, mid-day, and afternoon. Each visit lasted for 30 min, resulting in 2.5 h of minute-level data collected at each location. Local traffic information, including vehicle class and turning movements, were processed using computer vision techniques. The number of fast-food restaurants, cafes, trees, traffic signals, and building footprint, were found to have positive impacts on the mean UFP, while distance to the closest major road was negatively associated with UFP. We employed the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) method to develop prediction models for UFP concentrations. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) measures were used to capture the influence of each feature on model output. The model results demonstrated that minute-level counts of local traffic from different directions had significant impacts on near-road UFP concentrations, model performance was robust under random cross-validation as coefficients of determination (R2) ranged from 0.63 to 0.69, but it revealed weaknesses when data at specific locations were eliminated from the training dataset. This result indicates that proper cross-validation techniques should be developed to better evaluate machine learning models for air quality predictions.

Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution. Methods and analysis We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n =?130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen oxides (NO x), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities. Ethics and dissemination This environmental study was deemed exempt from full ethics review at Imperial College London and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; it was approved by the University of Ghana Ethics Committee (ECH 149/18-19). This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution.

We show that our proposed features are able to outperform their counterparts from local and closed sources, and illustrate how automated hyper parameter tuning can yield competitve results while alleviating the need for expert knowledge in machine learning and manual effort. Importantly, we further demonstrate the potential of the global availability of our features by applying cross-learning across different cities in order to reduce the need for a large amount of training samples. Overall, OpenLUR represents an off-the-shelf approach that facilitates easily reproducible experiments and the development of globally applicable models.

Such modeling efforts require accurate temperature prediction which is then used for predicting other meteorological phenomena such as urban heat island and fine dust air pollution. The automatic weather system (AWS) provides accurate temperature with high frequency but it cannot grasp spatially continuous distribution in detail because it is collected only at specific points. On the contrary, the LST data obtained from satellite imagery has a high spatial resolution and spatially continuous temperature can be grasped, but it is difficult to get high temporal frequency temperature data because of its revisit time. In this study, to solve this spatio-temporal tradeoff problem, a deep-learning method was used to create a spatially continuous temperature image using AWS data with a spatial resolution of 30Â m. The seasonal temperature was predicted with accuracy of 3.6Â Â°C for spring, 1.9Â Â°C for summer, 3Â Â°C for fall, and 1.4Â Â°C for winter. The predicted temperature accuracy for spatial resolution of 30Â m is better than other reported interpolation methods. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of the model, fine tuning procedures were applied to the deep learning model hyper parameters as well as the input feature data.

Accurate prediction of air pollutant concentration can more effectively control and prevent air pollution. In this study, a big data correlation principle and deep learning technology are used for a proposed model of predicting PM2.5 concentration. The model comprises a deep learning network model based on a residual neural network (ResNet) and a convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network (ConvLSTM). ResNet is used to deeply extract the spatial distribution features of pollutant concentration and meteorological data from multiple cities. The output is used as input to ConvLSTM, which further extracts the preliminary spatial distribution features extracted from the ResNet, while extracting the spatiotemporal features of the pollutant concentration and meteorological data. The model combines the two features to achieve a spatiotemporal correlation of feature sequences, thereby accurately predicting the future PM2.5 concentration of the target city for a period of time. Compared with other neural network models and traditional models, the proposed pollutant concentration prediction model improves the accuracy of predicting pollutant concentration. For 1- to 3-hours prediction tasks, the proposed pollutant concentration prediction model performed well and exhibited root mean square error (RMSE) between 5.478 and 13.622.

Based on the distribution of travel modes, transportation engineers could provide some proper strategies to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. With advanced sensing techniques, it is possible to collect high-resolution GPS trajectory data of travelers and we can infer travel modes using some popular machine learning methods. One of the difficult tasks facing the application of machine learning especially deep learning in travel mode detection is the lack of large, labeled dataset, because to label the trajectory data is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, samples of different travel modes are always unbalanced. Accordingly, in this paper, we take advantage of the generative model and the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to develop a hybrid travel modes detection model using less labeled trajectory data. Our key contribution is the utilization of a generative adversarial network (GAN) to artificially create some training samples in such a way that it not only increases the required sample size but balances the dataset to improve the accuracy of the detection model. Furthermore, CNN is applied to extract deep features of trajectory data, and then to classify the travel modes. The results show that the highest accuracy (86.70%) can be achieved by the proposed model. In particular, the proposed method can improve the detection accuracy of bus and driving modes because it can solve the small sample size problem.

We developed emulators to predict annual-mean fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) concentrations and their associated chronic health impacts from changes in five major emission sectors (residential, industrial, land transport, agriculture, and power generation) in China. The emulators predicted 99.9% of the variance in PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations. We used these emulators to estimate how emission reductions can attain air quality targets. In 2015, we estimate that PM2.5 exposure was 47.4 mu g m(-3) and O-3 exposure was 43.8 ppb, associated with 2,189,700 (95% uncertainty interval, 95UI: 1,948,000-2,427,300) premature deaths per year, primarily from PM2.5 exposure (98%). PM2.5 exposure and the associated disease burden were most sensitive to industry and residential emissions. We explore the sensitivity of exposure and health to different combinations of emission reductions. The National Air Quality Target (35 mu g m(-3)) for PM(2.5 )concentrations can be attained nationally with emission reductions of 72% in industrial, 57% in residential, 36% in land transport, 35% in agricultural, and 33% in power generation emissions. We show that complete removal of emissions from these five sectors does not enable the attainment of the WHO Annual Guideline (5 mu g m(-3)) due to remaining air pollution from other sources. Our work provides the first assessment of how air pollution exposure and disease burden in China varies as emissions change across these five sectors and highlights the value of emulators in air quality research. Plain Language Summary The ability of air quality models to help address important public health problems is limited by their high computational costs. Machine learning models can help by accurately representing these complicated air quality models for specific prediction tasks. These machine learning models can then be run many times at a fraction of the time and cost. Here, we developed machine learning models to predict long-term air quality and the associated health impacts in China from changes in emissions. We found that reducing emissions linearly improves particulate air quality and public health. The fractional improvements in public health were smaller than the fractional improvements in air quality. Removing emissions from five key sectors (residential, industrial, land transport, agriculture, and power generation) does not attain the World Health Organization Annual Guideline because of remaining pollution from other sources, such as from alternative anthropogenic emissions inside China, anthropogenic emissions outside China, and natural emissions.

We aimed to investigate these associations further in a Chinese adult study. Methods: Our analysis included 24,845 adults in the 33 Chinese Community Health Study in 2009. SV images from Tencent Map, segmented by machine learning algorithms, were used to determine the average proportion of green vegetation in SV images at community level in 800m road network buffer. Sensitivity analyses were performed with an alternative buffer size. Overall greenness was assessed as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in 800 m buffer. We used predicted PM2.5 and monitored NO2 as proxies of air pollution. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC) were regressed on SV greenness by generalized linear mixed models, with adjustment for covariates. Mediation analyses were performed to assess the mediation effects of air pollution. Results: Each interquartile range (IQR = 3.6%) increase in street view greenness was associated with a 0.15 kg/ m2 (95% CI: -0.22, -0.09) decrease in BMI and 0.23 cm (95% CI: -0.35, -0.11) reduction in HC, and was associated with 7% lower odds of overweight (OR = 0.93, 95% CI:0.90, 0.96) and 18% lower odds of obesity (OR = 0.82, 95% CI:0.76, 0.89). Similar effect estimation was observed compared with commonly-used NDVI measures. PM2.5 and NO2 mediated 15.5% and 6.1% of the effects of SV greenness with BMI, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest beneficial associations between community-level SV greenness and lower body weight in Chinese adults. The effects were observed in women but not in men. Air pollution may partially mediate the association.

Land-use distribution is one of the key factors affecting air quality, and research on the impact of land-use distribution on air pollution has drawn wide attention. However, considerable studies have mostly used linear regression models, which fail to capture the nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5(fine particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns) and to show how impacts on PM(2.5)vary with land-use magnitudes. In addition, related studies have generally focused on annual analyses, ignoring the seasonal variability of the impact of land-use distribution on PM2.5, thus leading to possible estimation biases for PM2.5. This study was designed to address these issues and assess the impacts of land-use distribution on PM(2.5)in Weifang, China. A machine learning statistical model, the boosted regression tree (BRT), was applied to measure nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5, capture how land-use magnitude impacts PM(2.5)across different seasons, and explore the policy implications for urban planning. The main conclusions are that the air quality will significantly improve with an increase in grassland and forest area, especially below 8% and 20%, respectively. When the distribution of construction land is greater than around 10%, the PM(2.5)pollution can be seriously substantially increased with the increment of their areas. The impact of gardens and farmland presents seasonal characteristics. It is noted that as the weather becomes colder, the inhibitory effect of vegetation distribution on the PM(2.5)concentration gradually decreases, while the positive impacts of artificial surface distributions, such as construction land and roads, are aggravated because leaves drop off in autumn (September-November) and winter (December-February). According to the findings of this study, it is recommended that Weifang should strengthen pollution control in winter, for instance, expand the coverage areas of evergreen vegetation likePinus bungeanaZucc. andEuonymus japonicusThunb, and increase the width and numbers of branches connecting different main roads.

The relationships between RH, pH, source behaviors and concentrations of SIA during different pollution episodes were discussed. Source emissions were found to influence pH and subsequently the SIA; high RH could result in high SIA because aerosol water content in atmosphere increases with RH, which is favorable for liquid-phase reactions. Finally, we employed statistical and machine learning (Random forest classification: RFC) methods to analysis importance of driving factors on SIA formation during different pollution episodes. Results showed precursors, wet conditions, atmospheric oxidation capacity and acidity favor formation of sulfate and nitrate at different pollution levels; changes of gaseous precursors, RH and temperature are more important to determine PM2.5 pollution classification (clean, slightly polluted, moderately polluted, heavily polluted episodes).

Two random forest submodels were developed to fill the daytime gaps in these two AOD datasets, which were then used as predictors in another random-forest submodel predicting the hourly PM2.5 concentrations in daytime.

Thereinto, the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (the Action Plan) numbers among the toughestever environmental protection policy in China, which significantly restrained haze pollution with a huge cost. In a policy-making for air cleaning, cost assessment is crucial. However, current main methods have a common shortcoming for which they neglect the cost on industrial restructurings. Thus, in this work, we proposed a novel approach to assess the comprehensive cost on the long-term PM 2.5 control in China under the Action Plan scenario. First, PM 2.5 pollution abatements and 10 precursor variations in China's 31 provinces were quantified via the Cohen's index. Then, provincial expenditures were jointed with their corresponding Cohen's indices of precursors and PM 2.5 mitigation, and patterns of the Action Plan were identified through machine learning. It was found that boiler regulation and industrial restructuring were the driving forces for most precursor decreases. Finally, the overall PM 2.5 pollution abatement was calculated by the fixed-effect model and jointed with the cumulative national expenditure to construct a cost curve, which can estimate the cost on both frontand end-of-pipe sections. Thus, the maximum budgets for several air quality targets were evaluated, which was found that China has to pay 10.24 and 51.55 trillion CNY within the PM 2.5 concentrations limits of 25 and 10 mu g/m 3 , respectively.

Furthermore, the Pin-ball loss function is employed to yield prediction intervals at different confidence levels, and a novel interval pseudo-code is constructed to optimize the prediction intervals thus promoting the probabilistic forecasting reliability. The simulations indicated that the developed system enhances the forecasting accuracy by maximum 60.6772%, 54.9793% and 38.6876% in the three steps of PM2.5 prediction and up to 64.9001%, 68.4637% in the interval sharpness at significance level 0.05 and 0.1 than the tested models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Expert Systems with Applications,10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120117,5,5,Yes,"LSTM,GRU,TCNN",,Yes,China,forecast,PM25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Focusing on the nonmotorized lanes along an expressway in Fuzhou, China, in this study, we established a cycling platform instrumented by portable detectors to collect fine particle (PM2.5), coarse particle (PM10), and black carbon (BC) concentrations at a high spatiotemporal resolution; then, wavelet transform (WT) and random forest (RF) methods were combined to reveal the fine-scale distribution of different particulate matter types. The results indicated that WT was able to accurately decompose the total measurement value (Ct) of each particulate matter into immediate vehicle-emitted (Cv) and background-contributed (Cb) values, thereby successfully identifying the spatiotemporal variations in traffic-induced pollution hotspots rather than background-disguised hotspots. Furthermore, the RF results were substantially better than the land-use regression results with regards to the fine-scale prediction of each particle in nonmotorized lanes. Although the RF predictions of Ct and Cv particles differed, traffic pollution hotspots could still be captured by the results. Compared to the measurements, the spatial distributions of the PM2.5 and PM10 predictions presented R2 values larger than 0.96, higher than those of BC (R2 = 0.77); this was the result of the different impacts of the same predictors, especially their differentiated determinants such as barometric pressure, relative humidity and air temperature. This study highlights the potential of using WT and RF methods to reveal fine-scale variations in roadside traffic pollution, which is beneficial for preventing and controlling air pollution in road microenvironments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,10.1007/s00477-023-02411-6,5,5,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, dioxins (DXN) are emitted at the stack and are the critical environmental indicator for operation optimization control in the MSWI process. However, constructing a high-precision and fast emission model for DXN emission operation optimization control becomes an immediate difficulty. To address the above problem, this research utilizes a novel DXN emission measurement method using simplified deep forest regression (DFR) with residual error fitting (SDFR-ref). First, the high-dimensional process variables are optimally reduced following the mutual information and significance test. Then, a simplified DFR algorithm is established to infer or predict the nonlinearity between the selected process variables and the DXN emission concentration. Moreover, a gradient enhancement strategy in terms of residual error fitting with a step factor is designed to improve the measurement performance in the layer-by-layer learning process. Finally, an actual DXN dataset from 2009 to 2020 of the MSWI plant in Beijing is utilized to verify the SDFR-ref method.

Research into the prediction of indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is traditionally confined to building materials and furniture. Relatively little research focuses on estimation of human-related VOCs, which have been shown to contribute significantly to indoor air quality, especially in densely-occupied environments. This study applies a machine learning approach to accurately estimate the human-related VOC emissions in a university classroom. The time-resolved concentrations of two typical human-related (ozone-related) VOCs in the classroom over a five-day period were analyzed, i.e., 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO), 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA). By comparing the results for 6-MHO concentration predicted via five machine learning approaches including the random forest regression (RFR), adaptive boosting (Adaboost), gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), we find that the LSSVM approach achieves the best performance, by using multi-feature parameters (number of occupants, ozone concentration, temperature, relative humidity) as the input. The LSSVM approach is then used to predict the 4-OPA concentration, with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) less than 5%, indicating high accuracy. By combining the LSSVM with a kernel density estimation (KDE) method, we further establish an interval prediction model, which can provide uncertainty information and viable option for decision-makers. The machine learning approach in this study can easily incorporate the impact of various factors on VOC emission behaviors, making it especially suitable for concentration prediction and exposure assessment in realistic indoor settings. © 2023, Tsinghua University Press.",Building Simulation,10.1007/s12273-022-0976-y,5,5,No,,,,"China,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work focuses to study the inadvertent effect of COVID-19 lockdown on air pollution. Pollutants' concentration before- and during- COVID-19 lockdown is captured to understand the variation in air quality. Firstly, multi-pollutant profiling using hierarchical cluster analysis of pollutants' concentration is performed that highlights the differences in the cluster compositions between before- and during-lockdown time periods. Results show that the particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) in air that formed the primary cluster before lock-down, came down to close similarity with other clusters during lockdown. Secondly, predicting air quality index (AQI) based on the forecasts of pollutants' concentration is performed using neural networks, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and boosting algorithms. The best-fitted models representing AQI is identified separately for before- and during-lockdown time periods based on its predictive power. While deterministic method reactively evaluates present AQI when current pollutants' concentration at a particular time and place are known, this study uses the best fitted data-driven model to determine future AQIs based on the forecasts of pollutant's concentration accurately (overall RMSE<0.1 for before lockdown scenario and <0.3 for during lockdown scenario). The study contributes to visualize the variation in pollutants' concentrations between the two scenarios. The results show that the reduced economic activities during lockdown period had led to the drop in concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 by 27% and 50% on an average. The findings of this study have practical and societal implications and serve as a reference mechanism for policymakers and governing bodies to revise their actions plans for regulating individual air pollutants in the atmospheric air. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Journal of Environmental Management,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116911,5,5,Yes,"LR,ANN,DT,XGB,RF,SVR",,No,"India,France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is necessary to establish an accurate PM2.5 concentration prediction system for urban air monitoring and control. Due to the nonlinear characteristics of PM2.5 concentration, it is difficult to predict it directly. Therefore, a novel hybrid model for PM2.5 concentration based on improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD), outlier-robust extreme learning machine (ORELM) optimized by hybrid cuckoo search (CS), and chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA), error correction (EC) is proposed named IVMD-ChOACS-ORELM-EC. First of all, an improved VMD based on energy loss coefficient, named IVMD, is proposed. IVMD decomposes the original data to obtain K IMF components. Then, a hybrid optimization algorithm based on ChOA improved by CS is proposed, named ChOACS. The hybrid optimization algorithm is used to optimize ORELM. On this basis, the prediction model ChOACS-ORELM is proposed, and the K IMF components are predicted by ChOACS-ORELM. Finally, the EC model based on decomposition ensemble is established to further improve the prediction accuracy. The PM2.5 concentration data collected at hourly intervals in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Qingdao in China are used as experimental data. The experimental results show that the correlation coefficients between the prediction results and the actual values of the four cities are 0.9999, and the prediction performance of the proposed model is better than that of all comparison models. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1007/s11356-023-25238-8,5,5,Yes,ELM,,No,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"hybrid cuckoo search (CS), and chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA), error correction (EC)",,,,variational mode decomposition (IVMD),,,,,,

To mitigate particulate air pollution, the Chinese government has been implementing a series of clean air actions. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on surface air pollutants data obtained from the China air quality observation network using a random forest (RF) approach, to evaluate the impact of clean air actions on aerosol pollution from 2015 to 2022. Overall, the observed PM2.5 and PM10 showed evidently decreasing trends during 2015–2022 in each season, with the largest trends in winter. Based on the RF model analysis, we further quantified the seasonal-dependent trends in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations driven by anthropogenic emissions over China, which were approximately −3.84 and −6.14, −2.82 and −4.71, −2.58 and −4.45, and −2.77 and −4.06 μg m−³ yr−1 for winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. Furthermore, anthropogenic emissions were estimated to contribute 34.44 and 54.98, 24.10 and 37.22, 23.48 and 36.20, and 21.04 and 30.69 μg m−3 to declines in annual mean PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations during the eight years in megacity clusters of eastern China for winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. These seasonal-dependent trend analyses reveal the largest reduction in ambient aerosol pollution due to anthropogenic emission abatements during cold season and further demonstrate substantial effectiveness of the clean air actions for improvement in particulate air quality in China. Correlation analysis on PM2.5 with the major meteorological parameters and the RF model built-in feature importance suggested that a combination of high relative humidity, shallow boundary layer heights, and low wind speeds could promote wintertime aerosol pollution in short-time scales over northern China (e.g., the North China plain). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Applied Geochemistry,10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105614,5,5,Yes,RF,,Yes,"China,United States",analysis,"PM25,PM10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies mainly focused on the variation of PM2.5 concentrations during daytime rather than nighttime. In addition, assessing the spatial variations of PM2.5 in large areas is a critical issue for environmental epidemiological studies to clarify the health effects from PM2.5 exposures. In terms of air pollution spatial modelling, using only a single model might lose information in capturing spatial and temporal correlation between predictors and pollutant levels. Hence, this study aimed to propose an ensemble mixed spatial model that incorporated Kriging interpolation, land-use regression (LUR), machine learning, and stacking ensemble approach to estimate long-term PM2.5 variations for nearly three decades in daytime and nighttime. Three steps of model development were applied: 1) linear based LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR were used to determine influential predictors; 2) machine learning algorithms were used to enhance model prediction accuracy; 3) predictions from the selected machine learning models were fitted and evaluated again to build the final ensemble mixed spatial model. The results showed that prediction performance increased from 0.514 to 0.895 for daily, 0.478 to 0.879 for daytime, and 0.523 to 0.878 for nighttime when applying the proposed ensemble mixed spatial model compared with LUR. Results of overfitting test and extrapolation ability test confirmed the robustness and reliability of the developed models. The distance to the nearest thermal power plant, density of soil and pebbles fields, and funeral facilities might affect the variation of PM2.5 levels between daytime and nighttime. The PM2.5 level was higher in daytime compared with nighttime with little difference, revealing the importance of estimating nighttime PM2.5 variations.

In the recent decade, the PM2.5 level has decreased mainly driven by reductions in particulate sulfate as a result of large-scale desulfurization efforts in coal-fired power plants and industrial facilities. Emerging evidence also points to the differential toxicity of particulate sulfate affecting human health. However, estimating the long-term spatiotemporal trend of sulfate is difficult because a ground monitoring network of PM2.5 constituents has not been established in China. Spaceborne sensors such as the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument can provide complementary information on aerosol size and type. With the help of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we developed a sulfate prediction model under support from available ground measurements, MISR-retrieved aerosol microphysical properties, and atmospheric reanalysis data at a spatial resolution of 0.1°. Our sulfate model performed well with an out-of-bag cross-validation R2 of 0.68 at the daily level and 0.93 at the monthly level. We found that the national mean population-weighted sulfate concentration was relatively stable before the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan was enforced in 2013, ranging from 10.4 to 11.5 µg m−3. But the sulfate level dramatically decreased to 7.7 µg m−3 in 2018, with a change rate of −28.7 % from 2013 to 2018. Correspondingly, the annual mean total non-accidental and cardiopulmonary deaths attributed to sulfate decreased by 40.7 % and 42.3 %, respectively.

Integrating methods of causal inference with supervised machine learning, we find that living in a high-poverty neighborhood increases exposure to many different air toxics during infancy, that it reduces cognitive abilities measured later at age 4 by about one-tenth of a standard deviation, and that about one-third of this effect can be attributed to disparities in air quality.

Hence, this work employs Sentinel 5P imagery and a novel artificial intelligence model for predicting air pollution in Kiev. A well-known machine learning (ML) model, namely, multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), is coupled with electromagnetic field optimization (EFO) algorithm to predict the daily concentration of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). Initially, a dataset is prepared by collecting 11 meteorological, atmospheric, and temporal factors from remote sensing and ground measurements. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to determine the most contributive factors and create a reduced dataset. Four scenarios are defined by considering the reduced/original dataset, along with, predicting the current day/one-day-ahead PM2.5. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the most accurate results were achieved for predicting one-day-ahead PM2.5 using the reduced dataset. After adjusting the EFO-MLPNN hybrid model, its performance is compared to classical MLPNN and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). According to the results, the EFO-MLPNN with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.68 μ g ċ m-3 and Pearson correlation coefficient ( RP ) of 0.82 outperformed both MLPNN and ANFIS outcomes. These findings infer that by optimizing the MLPNN by EFO, its prediction accuracy can be improved. The proposed hybrid model is therefore recommended for more practical air quality estimation and decision-making in the studied site.

We collected more than 1080 field-based surveys per participant. Surveys were matched with environmental and physiological measured variables collected indoors in their homes and offices. We then trained and tested seven machine learning models per participant to predict their thermal preferences. Participants indicated 58% of the time to want no change in their thermal environment despite completing 75% of these surveys at temperatures higher than 26.6°C. All but one personal comfort model had a median prediction accuracy of 0.78 (F1-score). Skin, indoor, near body temperatures, and heart rate were the most valuable variables for accurate prediction. We found that ≈250–300 data points per participant were needed for accurate prediction. We, however, identified strategies to significantly reduce this number. Our study provides quantitative evidence on how to improve the accuracy of personal comfort models, prove the benefits of using wearable devices to predict thermal preference, and validate results from previous studies. © 2022 The Authors.

The future vehicle electrification (VE), which in Europe will be importantly fostered by the ban of thermal engines from 2035, is expected to have an important effect on urban air quality. Machine learning models represent an optimal tool for predicting changes in air pollutants concentrations in the context of future VE. For the city of Valencia (Spain), a XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting package) model was used in combination with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis, both to investigate the importance of different factors explaining air pollution concentrations and predicting the effect of different levels of VE. The model was trained with 5 years of data including the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020, in which mobility was strongly reduced resulting in unprecedent changes in air pollution concentrations. The interannual meteorological variability of 10 years was also considered in the analyses. For a 70% VE, the model predicted: 1) improvements in nitrogen dioxide pollution (-34% to -55% change in annual mean concentrations, for the different air quality stations), 2) a very limited effect on particulate matter concentrations (-1 to -4% change in annual means of PM2.5 and PM10), 3) heterogeneous responses in ground-level ozone concentrations (-2% to +12% change in the annual means of the daily maximum 8-h average concentrations). Even at a high VE increase of 70%, the 2021 World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines will be exceeded for all pollutants in some stations. VE has a potentially important impact in terms of reducing NO2associated premature mortality, but complementary strategies for reducing traffic and controlling all different air pollution sources should also be implemented to protect human health.",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,10.1016/j.envres.2023.115835,5,5,No,,,,"Spain,Peoples R China,France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Air pollution from landscape fires can negatively affect human health4-6, but human exposure to landscape fire-sourced (LFS) air pollution has not been well characterized at the global scale7-23. Here, we estimate global daily LFS outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and surface ozone concentrations at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees resolution during the period 2000-2019 with the help of machine learning and chemical transport models. We found that overall population-weighted average LFS PM2.5 and ozone concentrations were 2.5 mu g m-3 (6.1% of all-source PM2.5) and 3.2 mu g m-3 (3.6% of all-source ozone), respectively, in 2010-2019, with a slight increase for PM2.5, but not for ozone, compared with 2000-2009. Central Africa, Southeast Asia, South America and Siberia experienced the highest LFS PM2.5 and ozone concentrations. The concentrations of LFS PM2.5 and ozone were about four times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. During the period 2010-2019, 2.18 billion people were exposed to at least 1 day of substantial LFS air pollution per year, with each person in the world having, on average, 9.9 days of exposure per year. These two metrics increased by 6.8% and 2.1%, respectively, compared with 2000-2009. Overall, we find that the global population is increasingly exposed to LFS air pollution, with socioeconomic disparities.

Designing a robust and reliable bus timetable is a pivotal step to increase ridership and reduce operating cost for transit authorities. However, most previous studies on bus timetabling rely on historical passenger count and travel time data to generate static schedules, which often yield biased results in these uncertain scenarios, such as demand surge or adverse weather. In addition, acquiring real-time passenger origin/destination from a limited number of running buses is not feasible. This article considers the multiline dynamic bus timetable optimization problem as a Markov decision process model to address the aforementioned issues, and proposes a multiagent deep reinforcement learning framework to ensure effective learning from the imperfect-information game, where the passenger demand and traffic condition are not always known in advance. Moreover, a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to overcome the limitation of high computational cost and low efficiency. A case study of multiple bus lines in Beijing, China, confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms heuristic and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms by reducing 20.30% of operating and passenger costs compared with actual timetables.",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS,10.1109/tii.2022.3158651,5,5,No,,,,"Peoples R China,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-resolution estimates of PM concentrations are conducive to evaluating accurate associations between traffic-related PM exposure and semen quality. Methods: In this study, we firstly developed a random forest model incorporating meteorological factors, land-use information, traffic-related variables, and other spatiotemporal predictors to estimate daily traffic-related PM concentrations, including PM2.5, PM10, and PM1. Then we enrolled 1310 semen donors corresponding to 4912 semen samples during the study period from January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019 in Guangzhou city, China. Linear mixed models were employed to associate individual exposures to traffic-related PM during the entire (0Â90 lag days) and key periods (0Â37 and 34Â77 lag days) with semen quality parameters, including sperm concentration, sperm count, progressive motility and total motility. Results: The results showed that decreased sperm concentration was associated with PM10 exposures (?: -0.21, 95 % CI: ?0.35, ?0.07), sperm count was inversely related to both PM2.5 (?: -0.19, 95 % CI: ?0.35, ?0.02) and PM10 (?: -0.19, 95 % CI: ?0.33, ?0.05) during the 0Â90 days lag exposure window. Besides, PM2.5 and PM10 might diminish sperm concentration by mainly affecting the late phase of sperm development (0Â37 lag days). Stratified analyses suggested that PBF and drinking seemed to modify the associations between PM exposure and sperm motility. We did not observe any significant associations of PM1 exposures with semen parameters. Conclusion: Our results indicate that exposure to traffic-related PM2.5 and PM10 pollution throughout spermatogenesis may adversely affect semen quality, especially sperm concentration and count. The findings provided more evidence for the negative associations between traffic-related PM exposure and semen quality, highlighting the necessity to reduce ambient air pollution through environmental policy.

Specifically, a statistical land use regression model, an extreme gradient boosting machine learning model (XGB), and three numerical/acoustic traffic noise models: the US Noise Model (FHWA-TNM2.5), a commercial noise model (CadnaA), and an open-source European model (Harmonoise) were optimized and compared. The results demonstrate that XGB and CadnaA were the most effective models for estimating traffic noise, and they are particularly adept at differentiating noise levels on different categories of road.

There is an urgent need for a spatial-temporal prediction model for characterizing PM2.5 chemical compositions to assess exposure risks and develop effective air pollutants reduction strategies. In this study, the spatial-temporal variations of NO3? and SO42? were characterized using a hybrid multi-step ahead neural network (MSA-NN)/Kriging model in the urban areas with limited PM2.5 constituents monitoring stations. A meteorological normalization technique was further applied to develop a de-weather model to investigate temporal variations of air pollutants during the level 3 COVID-19 alert in central Taiwan. The MSA-NN algorithm could predict 94% and 91% of NO3? and SO42?, respectively, at the t+1-time horizon predictions. Based on the predicted results using the present de-weather model, the reduction in primary emissions attributed to the impact of COVID-19 during the level 3 alert was found to dominate the temporal air pollutant concentrations in central Taiwan. The present model could provide applicable and accurate high resolution of spatial-temporal NO3? and SO42? datasets in an area with limited PM2.5 chemical composition measurement. The present model could also be potentially applied to facilitate hotspot identification and human exposure assessment. The present Artificial Neural Network-based de-weather model is applicable to predict meteorological normalized time series air pollutant concentrations, which could be used to verify the effects of the meteorological parameters and primary emissions on the variations in air quality during the implementation of a specific air quality control strategy or changes in anthropogenic activities.

Prediction of air quality plays a crucial role in warning people about the air quality levels. With the help of this, we can make the proper mechanism for reducing the overall impact of bad air quality on individualsÂ health. In this paper, we are focused on developing a mechanistic and quantitative prediction model for the prediction of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and Air Pollutant Concentration (NOx) levels with a clear environmental interpretation. The proposed model is based on the Linear Regression based Recursive Feature Elimination with Random Forest Regression (RFERF). For the experimental analysis, the seven well-established machine learning models have been taken, and these models are compared with our proposed model to find out their suitability and correctness. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2 score) have been used to validate the performance of prediction models. For the prediction of AQI and NOx, the data of the Central Pollution Control Board of India has been taken. The proposed model performs superior as compared to other prediction models with better accuracy and a higher prediction rate. This work also explains that linking machine learning with sensor-generated AQI data for air quality prediction is an adequate and appropriate way to solve some related environment glitches.

Identifying the subtype of COPD patients who are sensitive to environmental aggressions is necessary. Using in vitro and in vivo PM2.5 exposure models, we demonstrate that exosomal hsa_circ_0005045 is upregulated by PM2.5 and binds to the protein cargo peroxiredoxin2, which functionally aggravates hallmarks of COPD by recruiting neutrophil elastase and triggering in situ release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-? by inflammatory cells. The biological function of hsa_circ_0005045 associated with aggravation of COPD is validated using exosome-transplantation and conditional circRNA-knockdown murine models. By sorting the major components of PM2.5, we find that PM2.5-bound heavy metals, which are distinguishable from the components of cigarette smoke, trigger the elevation of exosomal hsa_circ_0005045. Finally, using machine learning models in a cohort with 327 COPD patients, the PM2.5 exposure-sensitive COPD patients are characterized by relatively high hsa_circ_0005045 expression, non-smoking, and group C (mMRC 0Â1 (or CAT &lt; 10) and ? 2 exacerbations (or ? 1 exacerbation leading to hospital admission) in the past year).

As one of the main components of air pollutants, accurate prediction of PM2.5 can provide a reference for air pollution control and pollution warning. This study proposes an air pollutant prediction and early warning framework, which innovatively combines feature extraction techniques, feature selection methods and intelligent optimization algorithms. First, the PM2.5 sequence is decomposed into several subsequences using the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, and then the new components of the subsequences with different complexity are reconstructed using fuzzy entropy. Then, the Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy method is used to select the influencing factors of the different reconstructed components. Then, a two-stage deep learning hybrid framework is constructed to model the prediction and nonlinear integration of the reconstructed components using a long short-term memory artificial neural network optimized by the gray wolf optimization algorithm. Finally, based on the proposed hybrid prediction framework, effective prediction and early warning of air pollutants are achieved. In an empirical study in three cities in China, the prediction accuracy, warning accuracy and prediction stability of the proposed hybrid framework outperformed the other comparative models. The analysis results indicate that the developed hybrid framework can be used as an effective tool for air pollutant prediction and early warning.

National-scale LURs typically employ predictors from multiple curated geodatabases at neighborhood scales. In this study, we instead developed national NO2 models relying on innovative street-level predictors extracted from Google Street View [GSV] imagery. Using machine learning (random forest), we developed two types of models: (1) GSV-only models, which use only GSV features, and (2) GSV + OMI models, which also include satellite observations of NO2. Our results suggest that street view imagery alone may provide sufficient information to explain NO2 variation. Satellite observations can improve model performance, but the contribution decreases as more images are available. Random 10-fold cross-validation R2 of our best models were 0.88 (GSV-only) and 0.91 (GSV + OMI) a performance that is comparable to traditional LUR approaches. Importantly, our models show that street-level features might have the potential to better capture intra-urban variation of NO2 pollution than traditional LUR. Collectively, our findings indicate that street view image-based modeling has great potential for building large-scale air quality models under a unified framework. Toward that goal, we describe a cost-effective image sampling strategy for future studies based on a systematic evaluation of image availability and model performance.

One of the main applications of urban air pollution monitoring is for exposure assessment and public health studies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches can be used to build air pollution models to predict pollutant concentrations and assess environmental and health risks. Air pollution data can be uploaded into AI/ML models to estimate different exposure levels within different communities. The correlation between exposure estimates and public health surveys is important for assessing health risks. These aspects are critical when it concerns environmental injustice. Computational approaches should efficiently manage, visualize, and integrate large datasets. Effective data integration and management are a key to the successful application of computational intelligence approaches in ecology. In this paper, we consider some of these constraints and discuss possible ways to overcome current problems and environmental injustice. The most successful global approach is the development of the smart city; however, such an approach can only increase environmental injustice as not all the regions have access to AI/ML technologies. It is challenging to develop successful regional projects for the analysis of environmental data in the current complicated operating conditions, as well as taking into account the time, computing power, and constraints in the context of environmental injustice.

Efforts have been made using chemical transport modelling and statistical approaches to evaluate the efficacy of the Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP; 2013-2017) and the Blue Sky Protection Campaign (BSPC; 2018-2020) enacted in China. Changes in air quality due to reduction in emissions can be masked by meteorology, making it highly challenging to reveal the real effects of control measures. A knowledge gap still existed with respect to how sources changed before and after the CAAP and BSPC were implemented, respectively, particularly in coastal areas where anthropogenic emissions mixed with additional natural sources (e.g. marine aerosol). This work applied a machine-learning-based meteorological normalization approach to decouple the meteorological effects from air quality trend in a coastal city in northern China (Qingdao). Secondly, the relative changes in source contributions to ambient PM2.5 with a ?10-year observation interval (2011-2012, 2016, and 2019) were also investigated. We discovered that the largest emission reduction section was likely from coal combustion as the meteorologically normalized SO2 dropped by ?15.5 %yr-1, and the annual average dispersion-normalized SO42- decreased by ?41.5 %. Change in the meteorologically normalized NO2 was relatively stable (?1.0 %yr-1), and NO3- changed inappreciably in 2016-2019 but was significantly higher than that prior to the CAAP. Crustal dust decreased remarkably after the CAAP began. Industrial emissions, for example, steel-related smelting, decreased after 2016 due to the relocation of steel-making enterprises. Note that vehicle emissions were increased in importance as opposed to the other primary sources. Similar to other megacities, Qingdao is also at risk of increased ozone pollution that in turn facilitates secondary-particle formation in the future. The policy assessment approaches applied in this work also work for other places where air quality management is highly in demand to reduce air pollution.

For comparison, the historical data during the identical period in 2019 and 2020 were also provided to determine the effect of the Level 3 COVID-19 alert on aerosols and gaseous pollutants concentrations in Taichung City. A machine learning model using the artificial neural network technique coupled with a kinetic model was applied to predict NOx, O3, nitrate (NO3?), and sulfate (SO42?) to investigate potential emission sources and chemical reaction mechanism. D during the Level 3 COVID-19 alert, a decrease in NOx concentration due to a decrease in traffic flow under the NOx-saturated regime was observed to enhance the secondary NO3? and O3 formation. The present models were shown to predict 80.1, 77.0, 72.6, and 67.2% concentrations of NOx, O3, NO3?, and SO42?, respectively, which could help decision-makers for pollutant emissions reduction policies development and air pollution control strategies.

We revealed that, for the China mainland, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its surroundings (""2 + 26"" cities), Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta, there could be at most 2897, 920, 1247, and 896 additional O3-related deaths in urban areas, respectively, accompanying 21,512, 3442, 5614, and 642 avoided O3-related deaths in rural areas, respectively, at the same control stage. Additionally, potential disbenefits during O3mitigation were ""pro-wealthy"", that is, residents in developed regions are more likely to afford additional health risks. In order to avoid OHBs during O3abatement, we proposed a two-phase control strategy, whereby the reduction ratio of NOX(nitrogen oxide) to VOCs (volatile organic compounds) was adjusted according to health benefit distribution patterns.

In this paper, we propose to use synthetic data generated by a realistic 3-D transport/dispersion simulator, to train a learning framework called MCxM. The latter relies on a sequence of masking and correction operations to progressively apply the spatial constraints and underlying physics of transport and dispersion. The learning phase uses the urban geometry of the French city Grenoble. We then test the effectiveness of the trained MCxM in a different French city: Paris.

The situation has reached such an alarming situation that knowing the extent of air pollution well in advance has become an absolute necessity before we step out of our home. An advance prediction can help the urban travellers to know the possibility of enhanced pollution ahead of time at strategic locations of a city and thereby be useful in planning a less polluted route. Different cities of the world have pollutants levels with varied dispersion pattern. As a result, a generic prediction model is needed that can cater to all types of pollutants and which can offer better forecasts of pollution data irrespective of their dispersion levels. In this paper, the authors modelled recurrent neural network (RNN)-based bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) that forecasts pollutants concentration with least RMSE. The model is trained and tested on the pollution data of Delhi, the most polluted capital city in the world for the second consecutive year in 2019.

However, the infection in China has been successfully controlled although its initial transmission was also nationwide and has caused a serious public health crisis. The analysis on the early-stage COVID-19 transmission in China is worth investigating for its guiding significance on prevention to other countries and regions. In this study, we conducted the experiments from the perspectives of COVID-19 occurrence and intensity. We eliminated unimportant factors from 113 variables and applied four machine learning-based classification and regression models to predict COVID-19 occurrence and intensity, respectively. The influence of each important factor was analysed when applicable. Our optimal model on COVID-19 occurrence prediction presented an accuracy of 91.91% and the best R2 of intensity prediction reached 0.778. Linear regression-based model was identified as unable to fit and predict the intensity, and thus only the variable influence on COVID-19 occurrence can be explained. We found that (1) CO VID-19 was more likely to occur in prosperous cities closer to the epicentre and located on higher altitudes, (2) and the occurrence was higher under extreme weather and high minimum relative humidity.

In this study, we employ a mobile monitoring method to collect PM2.5 and BC data in the city of Philadelphia, PA during the summer of 2019 and apply the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) methodology to examine relationships between urban structure and atmospheric pollution. We find that PM2.5 and BC vary by STURLA class, and some classes exhibit significant difference in pollution concentrations. We also find that the proportions in which STURLA components are present throughout the urban landscape can be used to predict the spatial distribution of urban air pollution. Among frequently sampled STURLA classes, gpl (grass, pavement, and low-rise buildings) hosted the highest PM2.5 concentrations on average (16.60 Â± 4.29 Âµg/m3), while tgbwp (trees, grass, bare soil, water, pavement) hosted the highest BC concentrations (2.31 Â± 1.94 Âµg/m3).

Further, both urban thermal environment research and sustainable development planning require an efficient estimation of anthropogenic heat flux (AHF). Therefore, this study proposed an improved multi-source AHF model, which was constructed using diverse data sources and small-scale samples, to better represent the spatiotemporal distribution of AHF. The performances of three machine learning algorithms (Cubist, gradient boosting decision tree, and simple linear regression) were quantitatively evaluated, and the impact of spatiotemporal heterogeneity on AHF estimation was considered for the first time. The results showed that multi-source datasets and sophisticated algorithms could more effectively reduce the estimation error and improve the accuracy of the spatiotemporal distribution of AHF than simple linear regression. In practical applications, the Cubist model performed better, with prediction errors being less than 0.9 W?m?2. Further, the characteristics of different heat sources from the model outputs varied widely, and the building metabolic heat exhibited significant seasonal spatiotemporal variations, which were largely determined by the regional climate. In contrast, industrial and transportation heat showed marginal monthly fluctuations. Similarly, spatiotemporal heterogeneity significantly affected the estimation of building metabolic heat (0.62 W?m?2), but it did not affect other heat sources. The proposed improved AHF model was verified to effectively capture the spatiotemporal variations of building heat and solve the issue of overestimation of industrial heat in urban regions. This study provides new methods and ideas for the accurate spatiotemporal quantification of AHF that can supplement future studies on climate warming, UHI, and air pollution.

For training and validation, data of indoor pollutants measured in child daycare facilities over a 1-month period were used. The results showed all the models produced a good performance for the prediction of indoor pollutants compared with the measured data. Among the models, the prediction by the LM model met the acceptable criteria of ASHRAE guideline 14 under all conditions. It was observed that the prediction performance decreased as the number of hidden layers increased. Moreover, the prediction performance was differed by the type of indoor pollutant. This was caused by patterns observed in the measured data. Considering the outcomes of the study, better prediction results can be obtained through the selection of suitable prediction models for time series data as well as the adjustment of training algorithms.

Accurate estimation of O3 exposure requires the ability to monitor O3 surface concentration with a high spatiotemporal resolution. Several spatiotemporal land use regression (LUR) models have integrated meteorological factors based on different statistical algorithms to support such epidemiological studies. From among such various existing statistical algorithms, we aim to identify a high-efficiency modeling method, as well as the most suitable lengths of the modeling period (time scale). Three types of typical spatiotemporal LUR models based on parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric statistic methods, respectively, are considered to predict daily ground-level O3 in the megacity of Tianjin, China. Based on monthly, seasonal (cold and warm), and annual time scales, these models include: a series of monthly hybrid LUR (Two-stage) models consisting of two sub-models based on the multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithm, general additive mixed models (GAMMs), and land use random forest (LURF) models. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to evaluate the temporal and spatial predictive accuracy of each model using the adjusted coefficient of determination (adjR2CV) and root mean square error (RMSECV). In the GAMMs and LURF models, models using a shorter time scale (monthly models) outperformed those using a longer one. In monthly models, the GAMMs performed the best, with the highest average adjR2CV (0.747) and the lowest average RMSECV (15.721 ?g/m3), followed by the LURF models (average adjR2CV = 0.695, average RMSECV = 16.405), and the Two-stage models (average adjR2CV = 0.466, average RMSECV = 23.934). Thus, the modeling format consisting of a shorter time scale and the GAMM algorithm performs relatively well in predicting daily O3 pollution on a megacity scale. These findings can be used to select appropriate modeling methods for epidemiological research of O3 pollution.

Atmospheric pollution forecasting can provide effective information for controlling atmospheric pollution, so this research proposes a CEEMD-MR-Hybrid model for SO2 forecasting, which employs CEEMD, machine learning models (CNN, PSOSVR, PSOBP) and mode refactor system (MR). The main feature of proposed model is to reconstruct the decomposed series using MR including random forest and sample entropy for hybrid forecasting. Sample entropy can combine decomposed series with similar characteristics by measuring the complexity of distinct decomposed series. Random forest can obtain decomposed sub-sequences high correlated with the original sequence by ranking characteristics importance. Five geographically diverse cities in China are selected to test the validation of the proposed model. Compared with previous CEEMD-RN-Hybrid models, the results of proposed hybrid models have higher consistency with actual data. Therefore, the innovative model can be utilized as an effective model for SO2 forecasting. Taking Shenzhen as an example, the MAPE values of all CEEMD-MR-Hybrid models are smaller than 10% for SO2 forecasting. Therefore, the innovative model provides a machine learning system which can efficiently refactor the decomposition series to improve the accuracy for hybrid model.

Objective: Our goal was to develop a machine-learning model to predict mean PM2.5 and max PM2.5 concentrations in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area from 2004 through 2019. Methods: We present a new modeling approach based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and inverse-distance weighting that uses AOD, meteorology, and land-use variables. We also investigated applications of our mean PM2.5 predictions that can aid local authorities in air-quality management and public-health surveillance, such as the co-occurrence of high PM2.5 and heat, compliance with local air-quality standards, and the relationship of PM2.5 exposure with social marginalization. Results: Our models for mean and max PM2.5 exhibited good performance, with overall cross-validated mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.68 and 9.20 ?g/m3, respectively, compared to mean absolute deviations from the median (MAD) of 8.55 and 15.64 ?g/m3. In 2010, everybody in the study region was exposed to unhealthy levels of PM2.5. Hotter days had greater PM2.5 concentrations. Finally, we found similar exposure to PM2.5 across levels of social marginalization. Significance: Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict highly spatiotemporally resolved PM2.5 concentrations even in regions with sparse monitoring. Impact: Our PM2.5 predictions can aid local authorities in air-quality management and public-health surveillance, and they can advance epidemiological research in Central Mexico with state-of-the-art exposure assessment methods.

To inform people about the air quality in their living areas, it is essential to measure the extent of pollution in the atmosphere. Air pollution sensors are assembled at static, fixed-site measurement monitoring stations to acquire data. The data can be processed at the fixed stations or transmitted to the server to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI). Some previous studies applied machine learning algorithms to predict the AQI. Even though those works showed good performance on specific data, the results are not consistent on different datasets. Moreover, to serve the need for low-cost AQI tracking and prediction, lightweight machine learning algorithms can be directly integrated into microcontroller hardware systems. This study proposed a new method that combines (i) air pollution data processing techniques and (ii) lightweight machine learning algorithms to enhance the AQI predicting performance. Three algorithms, namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were compared via three evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, and R2 to propose the best model in AQI prediction. Two different public datasets, which were both collected in different regions in India were used to verify our proposed method. XGBoost outperformed in predicting the AQI values. Thus, XGBoost is selected for the low-cost AQI prediction device assembled at fixed-site measurement stations.

It contributes to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases, and adversely impacts the health of billions of people. Despite its importance, detailed information about the spatial and temporal distribution of pollutants is complex to obtain. Ground-level monitoring stations are sparse, and approaches for modeling air pollution rely on extensive datasets which are unavailable for many locations. We introduce three techniques for the estimation of air pollution to overcome these limitations: 1) a baseline localized approach that mimics conventional land-use regression through gradient boosting; 2) an OpenStreetMap (OSM) approach with gradient boosting that is applicable beyond regions covered by detailed geographic datasets; and 3) a remote sensing-based deep learning method utilizing multiband imagery and trace-gas column density measurements from satellites. We focus on the estimation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a common anthropogenic air pollutant with adverse effects on the environment and human health. Our local baseline model achieves strong results with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.18 Â± $0.16~\mu ext {g/m}^{3}$ NO2. Substituting localized inputs with OSM leads to a degraded performance (MAE 7.22 Â± 0.14) but enables NO2 estimation at a global scale. The proposed deep learning model on remote sensing data combines high accuracy (MAE 5.5 Â± 0.14) with global coverage and heteroscedastic uncertainty quantification. Our results enable the estimation of surface-level NO2 pollution with high spatial resolution for any location on Earth. We illustrate this capability with an out-of-distribution test set on the US westcoast. Code1 and data2 are publicly available.

This is due to continuous usage of fossil fuel energy resources generating air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), which impact on climate and air quality and adversely affect the human health. The present paper aims at training an ensemble of forecasting methodologies for traffic-induced pollutant emissions and implementing it for predicting PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 for the case study of Cambridge, UK inner-city region. Such an ensemble enables decision makers to evaluate the impact of various transportation policies and measures on human health and the ecosystem, and subsequently contribute towards urban resilience and sustainability. Since the chemical synthesis of air pollution is triggered by meteorological factors, the forecasting incorporates them along with the traffic volumes. We opted to combine Statistical and Computational Intelligence learning methods including Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). Initially, Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE) and trend and seasonality removal was performed at data preprocessing and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) highlighted the principal parameters for ANFIS to predict next day's PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 values. LSTM and ELM methods estimated next day values and compared with the ANFIS model results for hourly time series data of length 2703. The performance of the embedded models was quantified by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2) indices. The ensemble was found to be superior in predicting PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 emissions when compared with existing traditional models.

Accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration is very important for air pollution monitoring and public health management. However, the presence of noise in PM2.5 data series is a major challenge of its accurate prediction. A novel hybrid PM2.5 concentration prediction model is proposed in this study by combining complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) method, PearsonÂs correlation analysis, and a deep long short-term memory (LSTM) method. CEEMD was employed to decompose historical PM2.5 concentration data to different frequencies in order to enhance the timing characteristics of data. PearsonÂs correlation was used to screen the different frequency intrinsic-mode functions of decomposed data. Finally, the filtered enhancement data were inputted to a deep LSTM network with multiple hidden layers for training and prediction. The results evidenced the potential of the CEEMD-LSTM hybrid model with a prediction accuracy of approximately 80% and model convergence after 700 training epochs. The secondary screening of PearsonÂs correlation test improved the model (CEEMD-Pearson) accuracy up to 87% but model convergence after 800 epochs. The hybrid model combining CEEMD-Pearson with the deep LSTM neural network showed a prediction accuracy of nearly 90% and model convergence after 650 interactions. The results provide a clear indication of higher prediction accuracy of PM2.5 with less computation time through hybridization of CEEMD-Pearson with deep LSTM models and its potential to be employed for air pollution monitoring.

In this paper we propose a multi-pollutant space-time learning network (Multi-AP learning network), which estimates pixel-wise (grid-level) concentrations of multiple air pollutant species based on fixed-station measurements and multi-source urban features, including land use information, traffic data, and meteorological conditions. We infer concentrations of multiple pollutants within one integrated learning network, which is applied to and evaluated on a case study in Chengdu (4900 km2, 26 April - 12 June 2019), where air pollutant (PM2.5, PM10 and O3) measurements from 40 monitoring sites are used to train the network to estimate pollutant concentrations in 4900 grid-cells (1 km2). The Multi-AP learning network allows us to estimate highly-resolved (1 km Ã 1 km, hourly) air pollution maps based on pollutant measurements which cover less than 1% of the grid-cells with better accuracy compared to other approaches, and with significant computational efficiency improvements. The time-cost is 1/3 of the time-cost of modelling each pollutant individually. Furthermore, we evaluate the relative importance of features and find that the meteorological feature set is the most important followed the land use features. The proposed Multi-AP method could be used to estimate air pollution exposure across a city using a limited set of air pollution monitoring sites.

Residual learning is designed to avoid unpredictable oscillations when training the network and verifying errors. For the issue of characteristic statistical migration and saddle point proliferation in deep network, the orthogonality regularizations are designed to stabilize the back-propagation errors, utilizing various advanced analytical tools such as restricted isometry property without extra hassle.

This study aims to create O3 isopleths in urban and suburban environments, based on machine learning with air quality data collected from 2001 to 2017 at urban (EA) and suburban (CC) monitoring stations from Madrid (Spain). Artificial neural network (ANN) models have powerful fitting performance, describing correctly several complex and nonlinear relationships such as O3 and his precursors (VOC and NOx). Also, ANN learns from the experience provided by data, contrary to mechanistic models based on the fundamental laws of natural sciences. The determined isopleths showed a different behaviour of the VOC-NOx-O3 system compared to the one achieved with a mechanistic model (EKMA curve): e.g. for constant NOx concentrations, O3 concentrations decreased with VOC concentrations in the ANN model. Considering the difficulty to model all the phenomena (and acquired all the required data) that influences O3 concentrations, the statistical models may be a solution to describe this system correctly. The applied methodology is a valuable tool for defining mitigation strategies (control of precursorsÂ emissions) to reduce O3 concentrations.

As such, efforts to predict the evolution and estimate statistically significant effects of covariates related to this air pollutant are recommended. Bayesian, econometrics and machine learning models are applied to predict future values of sulfur dioxide emissions in the vicinity of the most relevant thermoelectric power plant located in Portugal. Based on a multivariate time series analysis containing data that ranges from July 2017 to April 2020, several conclusions are identified. Predicted values of sulfur dioxide emissions of the five models exhibiting the lowest forecast error are strongly correlated, particularly in the interval 0.35Â±0.10?g/m3. The application of multi-step ahead forecasting analysis and nonlinear ensemble algorithms reinforces the main result from the one-step ahead forecasting exercise, where it is demonstrated that machine learning models have a better generalization power compared to classical approaches. Additionally, an identification strategy is proposed to assess the efficacy of a firm-specific measure adopted in 2017 (i.e., qualitative improvement of the desulfurization process to reduce the level of sulfur dioxide emissions). Super learning algorithms confirm that sulfur dioxide emissions in 2017 were approximately 19% greater relative to the period 2018Â2020, which allows to conclude that the effort promoted by the firm was effective. From a regulatory point of view, this study confirms that Portugal is likely to satisfy 2030 targets imposed by supranational regulation for sulfur dioxide emissions and provides useful recommendations to ensure the persistence of best air quality sustainability practices.

We conducted a mobile monitoring campaign over 20 days in 2019. Regression models were trained on land use data and combined with predictions from convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained to predict UFP and BC concentrations using satellite and street-level images. The combined UFP model (R2= 0.54) outperformed the CNN (R2= 0.47) and land use regression (LUR) models (R2= 0.47) on their own. Similarly, the combined BC model also outperformed the CNN and LUR BC models (R2= 0.51 vs 0.43 and 0.45, respectively). Spatial variations in model performance were more stable for the CNN and combined models compared to the LUR models, suggesting that the combined approach may be less likely to contribute to differential exposure measurement error in epidemiological studies.

Here, the PM2.5 concentrations of the Busan North and Busan New Ports were predicted using a recurrent neural network and long short-term memory model by employing the shipping activity data of Busan Port. In contrast to previous studies that employed only air quality and meteorological data as input data, our model considered shipping activity data as an emission source.

The health outcomes were categorized as: any health symptoms, asthma, allergy and flu-like symptoms. Both logistic regression and random forest (RF) methods were used to predict the four categories of health outcomes, and the methods prediction performance was compared. Results: The RF method we employed for analysis showed that common risk factors for the investigated categories of health outcomes, included: environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), dampness in the indoor school environment, male gender, air freshener use, residence located in proximity of traffic (<200 m), stressful schoolwork, and classroom noise (contributions ranged from 7.91% to 23.12%). Specificity, accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) values for most outcomes were higher when using RF compared to logistic regression, while sensitivity was similar in both methods. Conclusion: This study suggests that ETS, dampness in the indoor school environment, use of air fresheners, living in proximity to traffic (<200 m) and noise are common environmental risk factors for the investigated health outcomes.

These results showed that combining linear and nonlinear models through multiple data division methods would be an effective tool to forecast PM2.5 concentrations.

This warrants development of measures to predict and prevent these conditions. We aimed to investigate the predictive ability of a spectrum of data mining methods to predict childhood AD and AR using longitudinal birth cohort data. We conducted a 14-year follow-up of infants born to pregnant women who had undergone maternal examinations at nine selected maternity hospitals across Taiwan during 2000Â2005. The subjects were interviewed using structured questionnaires to record data on basic demographics, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, medical history, and 24-h dietary recall. Hourly concentrations of air pollutants within 1 year before childbirth were obtained from 76 national air quality monitoring stations in Taiwan. We utilized weighted K-nearest neighbour method (k = 3) to infer the personalized air pollution exposure. Machine learning methods were performed on the heterogeneous attributes set to predict allergic diseases in children. A total of 1439 mother-infant pairs were recruited in machine learning analysis. The prevalence of AD and AR in children up to 14 years of age were 6.8% and 15.9%, respectively. Overall, tree-based models achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than other methods, with areas under receiver operating characteristic curve of 83% for AD and 84% for AR, respectively. Our findings confirmed that prenatal air quality is an important factor affecting the predictive ability. Moreover, different air quality indices were better predicted, in combination than separately. Combining heterogeneous attributes including environmental exposures, demographic information, and allergens is the key to a better prediction of children allergies in the general population. Prenatal exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and its concatenation changes with time were significant predictors for AD and AR till adolescent.

With increasing air pollution, implementing efficient air quality monitoring models that collect information about air pollution concentration and assess air pollution in each area is necessary. Prediction methods for air quality forecasting have attracted much attention due to their performance and flexible capability. In this paper, an ensemble prediction methodology called the geographically weighted predictor method (GWP) combines the best version of machine learning algorithms and uses the additional predictor variables for prediction at the hourly level. The proposed method is employed on the Bangkok Air Quality dataset. Compared with regular machine learning models, the proposed method has better prediction performance in all prediction horizons. The results obtained suggest that such a novel model may help to enhance the accuracy of AQI prediction.

Despite their important findings, previous studies were mostly limited to single-domain evaluations of the indoor environment (e.g., thermal, visual, acoustic, or air quality), and rarely considered general well-being or productivity metrics. A holistic data analysis approach is proposed to quantify the multidomain drivers of overall comfort, perceived productivity, and perceived happiness of occupants. The approach combines exploratory and explanatory analysis methods (correlation, correspondence analysis, and machine learning) and was demonstrated using data collected from 206 occupants of 3 buildings in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Results showed that satisfaction levels with noise, air quality, and temperature are the main drivers of the studied multidomain metrics. However, threshold-based relationships were observed at the comfort scale's extremes, challenging the linearity assumption often adopted in previous studies. Practical implications of the findings include focusing facility management efforts on specific environmental domains that act as levers for overall satisfaction and well-being, instead of aiming to improve satisfaction with all domains simultaneously. Such levers are context-dependent, confirming the need for the proposed data analysis approach that is applicable to any built environment. Finally, the case study also highlighted the modeling capabilities of the tested machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting), which achieved predictive accuracies up to 38% higher than those of regression-based statistical models.

This study applied machine-learning methods to evaluate how indoor environmental conditions at home and school contribute to asthma and allergy-related symptoms. Methods: We randomly selected 10 public schools representing different socioeconomic statuses in New York State (2017Â2019) and distributed questionnaires to students to collect health status and home-and school-environmental exposures. Indoor air quality was measured at school, and ambient particle exposures (PM2.5 and components) were measured using real-time personal monitors for 48 h. We used random forest model to identify the most important risk factors for asthma and allergy-related symptoms, and decision tree for visualizing the inter-relationships among the multiple risk factors with the health outcomes. Results: The top contributing factors identified for asthma were family rhinitis history (relative importance: 10.40%), plant pollen trigger (5.48%); bedroom carpet (3.58%); environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) trigger symptom (2.98%); and ETS exposure (2.56%). For allergy-related symptoms, plant pollen trigger (10.88%), higher paternal education (7.33%), bedroom carpet (5.28%), family rhinitis history (4.78%), and higher maternal education (4.25%) were the strongest contributing factors. Conversely, primary heating with hot water radiator was negatively (?6.86%) associated with asthma symptoms. Younger children (&lt;9 years old) with family history of rhinitis and carpeting in the bedroom were the prominent combined risk factors for asthma. Children jointly exposed to pollen, solvents, and carpeting in their home tended to have greater risks of allergy-related symptoms, even without family history of rhinitis. Conclusion: Family rhinitis history, bedroom carpet, and pollen triggers were the most important risk factors for both asthma and allergy-related symptoms. Our new findings included that hot-water radiator was related to reduced asthma symptoms, and the combination of young age, rhinitis history, and bedroom carpeting was related to increased asthma symptoms. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144746,11,4,No,,,,"United States,China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, previous studies of the health effects of residential exposure to radon in the United States were commonly based on a county-level temporally invariant radon model that was developed using measurements collected in the mid- to late 1980s. We developed a machine learning model to predict monthly radon concentrations for each ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) in the Greater Boston area based on 363,783 short-term measurements by Spruce Environmental Technologies, Inc., during the period 2005-2018. A two-stage ensemble-based model was developed to predict radon concentrations for all ZCTAs and months. Stage one included 12 base statistical models that independently predicted ZCTA-level radon concentrations based on geological, architectural, socioeconomic, and meteorological factors for each ZCTA. Stage two aggregated the predictions of these 12 base models using an ensemble learning method. The results of a 10-fold cross-validation showed that the stage-two model has a good prediction accuracy with a weighted R2 of 0.63 and root mean square error of 22.6 Bq/m3.

Governed by emission characteristics and meteorological conditions, the formation and destruction of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) are complicated, and accurate predictions of the concentrations of these two major secondary atmospheric pollutants remain challenging. In this study, by combining meteorological and air pollutant data from ground observations and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations, a deep learning model structure based on long short-term memory layers (LSTM) was developed and applied to predict the PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the future 48 h period. The forecasting improvement was extended to the whole Greater Bay Area by introducing a spatial correction (SC) method to the CMAQ simulation results. Compared with the original CMAQ forecast, the new method gained a 26% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and a 33% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE), respectively, in terms of PM2.5; it also achieved a 40% reduction in MAE and a 34% reduction in RMSE in terms of O3. SC method, applied to the whole GBA region, also reduced the overall MAE and RMSE by 10% and 17% in terms of PM2.5 and by 31% and 25% in terms of O3, respectively.

When it exceeds the standard value, it is considered to cause pollution and lower the air quality, which is harmful to human health and can cause a variety of diseases, i.e., asthma, chronic bronchitis, etc. Therefore, the prediction of PM2.5 concentration is helpful to reduce its harm. In this paper, a hybrid model called CNN-BiLSTM-Attention is proposed to predict the PM2.5 concentration over the next two days. First, we select the PM2.5 concentration data in hours from January 2013 to February 2017 of Shunyi District, Beijing. The auxiliary data includes air quality data and meteorological data. We use the sliding window method for preprocessing and dividing the corresponding data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. Second, CNN-BiLSTM-Attention is composed of the convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory neural network, and attention mechanism. The parameters of this network structure are determined by the minimum error in the training process, including the size of the convolution kernel, activation function, batch size, dropout rate, learning rate, etc. We determine the feature size of the input and output by evaluating the performance of the model, finding out the best output for the next 48 h. Third, in the experimental part, we use the test set to check the performance of the proposed CNN-BiLSTM-Attention on PM2.5 prediction, which is compared by other comparison models, i.e., lasso regression, ridge regression, XGBOOST, SVR, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM. We conduct short-term prediction (48 h) and long-term prediction (72 h, 96 h, 120 h, 144 h), respectively. The results demonstrate that even the predictions of the next 144 h with CNN-BiLSTM-Attention is better than the predictions of the next 48 h with the comparison models in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2 ).

The use of chemical transport models to quantify the impacts of various emission changes on air quality is limited by their large computational demands. Machine learning models can emulate chemical transport models to provide computationally efficient predictions of outputs based on statistical associations with inputs. We developed novel emulators relating emission changes in five key anthropogenic sectors (residential, industry, land transport, agriculture, and power generation) to winter ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations across China. The emulators were optimized based on Gaussian process regressors with Matern kernels. The emulators predicted 99.9% of the variance in PM2.5 concentrations for a given input configuration of emission changes. PM2.5 concentrations are primarily sensitive to residential (51%Â94% of first-order sensitivity index), industrial (7%Â31%), and agricultural emissions (0%Â24%). Sensitivities of PM2.5 concentrations to land transport and power generation emissions are all under 5%, except in South West China where land transport emissions contributed 13%. The largest reduction in winter PM2.5 exposure for changes in the five emission sectors is by 68%Â81%, down to 15.3Â25.9Â ?g m?3, remaining above the World Health Organization annual guideline of 10Â ?g m?3. The greatest reductions in PM2.5 exposure are driven by reducing residential and industrial emissions, emphasizing the importance of emission reductions in these key sectors. We show that the annual National Air Quality Target of 35Â ?g m?3 is unlikely to be achieved during winter without strong emission reductions from the residential and industrial sectors. Â© 2021.

In recent years, tropospheric ozone has been recognized as an important greenhouse gas and pollutant that is detrimental to human health, agriculture, and natural ecosystems, and has shown a trend of increasing interest. Machinelearning- based approaches have been widely applied to the estimation of tropospheric ozone concentrations, but few studies have included tropospheric ozone profiles. This study aimed to predict the Northern Hemisphere distribution of Lower-Stratosphere-to-Troposphere (LST) ozone at a pressure of 100 hPa to the near surface by employing a deep learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. We referred to a history of all the observed parameters (meteorological data of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), satellite data, and the ozone profiles of the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC)) between 2014 and 2018 for training the predictive models. Model-measurement comparisons for the monitoring sites of WOUDC for the period 2019-2020 show that the mean correlation coefficients (R2) in the Northern Hemisphere at high latitude (NH), Northern Hemisphere at middle latitude (NM), and Northern Hemisphere at low latitude (NL) are 0.928, 0.885, and 0.590, respectively, indicating reasonable performance for the LSTM forecasting model. To improve the performance of the model, we applied the LSTM migration models to the Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container (CARIBIC) flights in the Northern Hemisphere from 2018 to 2019 and three urban agglomerations (the Sichuan Basin (SCB), North China Plain (NCP), and Yangtze River Delta region (YRD)) between 2018 and 2019. The results show that our models performed well on the CARIBIC data set, with a high R2 equal to 0.754. The daily and monthly surface ozone concentrations for 2018-2019 in the three urban agglomerations were estimated from meteorological and ancillary variables. Our results suggest that the LSTM models can accurately estimate the monthly surface ozone concentrations in the three clusters, with relatively high coefficients of 0.815-0.889, root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.769-8.729 ppb, and mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 6.111-6.930 ppb.

In general, the trained module based on LSTM is robust and can capture the variation of the atmospheric ozone distribution. Moreover, it also contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of air pollution, especially increasing our comprehension of pollutant areas. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Two-week integrated measurements of PM1.0 (median aerodiameter &lt; 1.0 ?m) were collected at 50 sampling sites during fall (2010), winter (2011), and summer (2011) in the Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada. PM1.0 filters were analyzed for metals and trace elements using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. OLS- and RF-LUR models were developed for approximately 30 PM1.0 trace elements in each season. Model predictors included industrial, commercial, and institutional/ government/ military land use, roadways, shipping, other transportation sources, and wind rose information. RF generated more accurate models than OLS for most trace elements based on 5-fold cross validation. On average, summer models had the highest cross validation R2 (OLS-LUR = 0.40, RF-LUR = 0.46), while fall had the lowest (OLS-LUR = 0.27, RF-LUR = 0.31). Many OLS-LUR models displayed overprediction in the final exposure surface. In contrast, RF-LUR models did not exhibit overpredictions. Taking overpredictions and cross validation performances into account, OLS-LUR performed better than RF-LUR in roughly 20% of the seasonal trace element models. RF-LUR models provided more interpretable predictors in most cases. Seasonal predictors varied, likely due to differences in seasonal distribution of trace elements related to source activity, and meteorology.

The results reveal landscape changes in the downstream areas of Da'an and Dajia rivers, with an increase of 370,820 m2 and 1,554,850 m2 of bare land areas in the dry season compared with the wet season in Da'an and Dajia rivers, respectively. On the basis of the maximum emission of river dust, PM10 concentration increases considerably during both wet and dry seasons near the two rivers. Among 25 different types of weather conditions, frontal surface transit, outer-region circulation from tropical depression system, weak northeast monsoons, and anticyclonic outflow have considerable influence on PM10 diffusion. In particular, weak northeast monsoons cause the highest health risk in the areas between Da'an and Dajia rivers, which is the densely populated Taichung City. Future studies should attempt to elucidate the environmental impact of dust in different weather conditions and understand the spatial risks to human health due to PM10 concentration. Facing the increasing threat of climate and landscape changes, governments are strongly encouraged to begin multimedia assessments in environmental management and propose a long-term and systematic framework in resources planning.

However, owing to the complexity and differences in spatiotemporal changes for various types of pollution, it is challenging to establish a framework that can capture the spatiotemporal correlations of different types of air pollution and obtain high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning framework suitable for predicting various air pollutants: a graph convolutional temporal sliding long short-term memory (GT-LSTM) model. The hybrid integrated model combines graph convolutional networks and long short-term networks based on a strategy with temporal sliding. Herein, the graph convolution networks gather neighbor information for spatial dependency modeling based on the spatial adjacency matrices of different pollutants and the graph convolution operator with parameter sharing. LSTM networks with a temporal sliding strategy are used to learn dynamic air pollution changes for temporal dependency modeling. The framework was applied to predict the average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, O3, CO, SO2, and NO2 in the Bejing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region for the next 24Â hours. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed GT-LSTM model could extract high-level spatiotemporal features and achieve higher accuracy and stability than state-of-the-art baselines. Advancement in this methodology can assist in providing decision support capabilities to mitigate air quality issues.

To improve the forecast accuracy, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on two-stage decomposition embedded sample entropy, group teaching optimization algorithm (GTOA), and extreme learning machine (ELM) to forecast the concentration of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). First, the improvement complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) is employed to decompose the concentration data of PM10 and PM2.5 into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different frequencies. In addition, wavelet transform (WT) is utilized to decompose the IMFs with high frequency based on sample entropy values. Then the GTOA algorithm is used to optimize ELM. Furthermore, the GTOA-ELM is utilized to predict all the subseries. The final forecast result is obtained by ensemble of the forecast results of all subseries. To further prove the predictable performance of the hybrid approach on air pollutants, the hourly concentration data of PM2.5 and PM10 are used to make one-step-, two-step-and three-step-ahead predictions. The empirical results demonstrate that the hybrid ICEEMDAN-WT-GTOA-ELM approach has superior forecasting performance and stability over other methods.

One main issue hindering the successful implementation of gas sensors in real-world applications is the lack of appropriate calibration procedures for advanced gas sensor systems. This article presents a calibration scheme for gas sensors based on statistically distributed gas profiles with unique randomized gas mixtures. This enables a more realistic gas sensor calibration including masking effects and other gas interactions which are not considered in classical sequential calibration. The calibration scheme is tested with two different metal oxide semiconductor sensors in temperature-cycled operation using indoor air quality as an example use case. The results are compared to a classical calibration strategy with sequentially increasing gas concentrations. While a model trained with data from the sequential calibration performs poorly on the more realistic mixtures, our randomized calibration achieves significantly better results for the prediction of both sequential and randomized measurements for, for example, acetone, benzene and hydrogen. Its statistical nature makes it robust against overfitting and well suited for machine learning algorithms. Our novel method is a promising approach for the successful transfer of gas sensor systems from the laboratory into the field.

Moreover, very few studies have examined whether such impacts differ across socioeconomic groups. Objectives: We aim to examine how ignoring individual mobility and PM2.5 variations produces misclassification errors in ambient PM2.5 exposure estimates. Methods: We developed a geo-informed backward propagation neural network model to estimate hourly PM2.5 concentrations in terms of remote sensing and geospatial big data. Combining the estimated PM2.5 concentrations and individual trajectories derived from 755,468 mobile phone users on a weekday in Shenzhen, China, we estimated four types of individual total PM2.5 exposures during weekdays at multi-temporal scales. The estimate ignoring individual mobility, PM2.5 variations or both was compared with the hypothetical error-free estimate using paired sample t-test. We then quantified the exposure misclassification error using Pearson correlation analysis. Moreover, we examined whether the misclassification error differs across different socioeconomic groups. Taking findings of ignoring individual mobility as an example, we further investigated whether such findings are robust to the different selections of time. Results: We found that the estimate ignoring PM2.5 variations, individual mobility or both was statistically different from the hypothetical error-free estimate. Ignoring both factors produced the largest exposure misclassification error. The misclassification error was larger in the estimate ignoring PM2.5 variations than that ignoring individual mobility. People with high economic status suffered from a larger exposure misclassification error. The findings were robust to the different selections of time. Conclusions: Ignoring individual mobility, PM2.5 variations or both leads to misclassification errors in ambient PM2.5 exposure estimates. A larger misclassification error occurs in the estimate neglecting PM2.5 variations than that ignoring individual mobility, which is seldom reported before.

The i-Tree Eco software application can be used to estimate regulating ecosystem services provided by urban forests. However, existing municipal tree inventories may not contain data necessary for running i-Tree Eco and manual field surveys are costly and time consuming. Using a tree inventory of Oslo, Norway, as an example, we demonstrate the potential of geospatial and machine learning methods to supplement missing and incomplete i-Tree Eco attributes in existing municipal inventories for the purpose of rapid low-cost urban ecosystem accounting. We correlate manually surveyed stem diameter and crown dimensions derived from airborne laser scanning imagery to complete most structural attributes. We then use auxiliary spatial datasets to derive missing attributes of treesÂ spatial context and include differentiation of air pollution levels. The integration of Oslo's tree inventory with available spatial data increases the proportion of records suitable for i-Tree Eco analysis from 19 % to 54 %. Furthermore, we illustrate how machine learning with Bayesian networks can be used to extrapolate i-Tree Eco outputs and infer the value of the entire municipal inventory. We find the expected total asset value of municipal trees in Oslo to be 38.5Â43.4 million USD, depending on different modelling assumptions. We argue that there is a potential for greater use of geospatial methods in compiling information for valuation of urban tree inventories, especially when assessing location-specific tree characteristics, and for more spatially sensitive scaling methods for determining asset values of urban forests for the purpose of awareness-raising. However, given the available data in our case, we question the accuracy of values inferred by Bayesian networks in relation to the purposes of ecosystem accounting and tree compensation valuation.

First, the data were decomposed into several sub-sequences by a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Second, the subsequences are reconstructed by variational mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, the new subsequences are predicted by the extreme learning machine combined with the whale optimization algorithm. The empirical analysis was carried out through 8 data sets. According to the experimental results, three main conclusions can be drawn. First, the proposed model in this paper has excellent prediction performance and robustness. In all the comparison experiments, the R2 and RMSE of the proposed model are the best among all the models. Second, data preprocessing is very necessary. After adding the decomposition algorithm, the average improvement levels of R2 and RMSE were 897.57% and 50.78%, respectively. Third, the re-decomposition of IMF1 is an effective method to improve prediction accuracy. After the re-decomposition of IMF1, R2 can be improved by 13.64% on average on the original basis, and RMSE can be reduced by 31.99% on average.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of monthly mean daily maximum 8-h average O-3 concentrations in China from 2005 to 2019 at a 0.05 degrees spatial resolution. METHODS: We developed a machine learning model with a satellite-derived boundary-layer O-3 column, O-3 precursors, meteorological conditions, land-use information, and proxies of anthropogenic emissions as predictors. RESULTS: The random, spatial, and temporal cross-validation R-2 of our model were 0.87, 0.86, and 0.76, respectively. Model-predicted spatial distribution of ground-level O-3 concentrations showed significant differences across seasons. The highest summer peak of O-3 occurred in the North China Plain, whereas southern regions were the most polluted in winter. Most large urban centers showed elevated O-3 levels, but their surrounding suburban areas may have even higher O-3 concentrations owing to nitrogen oxides titration. The annual trend of O-3 concentrations fluctuated over 2005-2013, but a significant nationwide increase was observed afterward. DISCUSSION: The present model had enhanced performance in predicting ground-level O-3 concentrations in China.

In this study, four tree-based algorithm machine learning models, decision trees (DT), gradient boost decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF) and extra-trees (ET), were used to estimate ground-level NO2 concentrations. In addition to considering many influencing factors of the ground-level NO2 concentrations, we especially introduced simplified temporal and spatial information into the estimation models. The results show that the extra-trees with spatial and temporal information (ST-ET) model has great performance in estimating ground-level NO2 concentrations with a cross-validation R2 of 0.81 and RMSE of 3.45 ?g/m3 in test datasets. The estimated results for 2019 based on the ST-ET model achieves a satisfactory accuracy with a cross-validation R2 of 0.86 compared with the other models. Through time-space analysis and comparison, it was found that the estimated high-resolution results were consistent with the ground observed NO2 concentrations. Using data from January 2020 to test the prediction power of the models, the results indicate that the ST-ET model has a good performance in predicting ground-level NO2 concentrations.

The model is shown to accurately predict PM10 (overall R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 7.44 ?g/m3) for measurement sites in Germany. The capability of satellite observations to map and monitor surface air pollution is assessed by investigating the relationship between AOD and PM10 in the same modeling setup. Sensitivity analyses show that important drivers of modeled PM10 include multiday mean wind flow, boundary layer height (BLH), day of year (DOY), and temperature. Different mechanisms associated with elevated PM10 concentrations are identified in winter and summer. In winter, mean predictions of PM10 concentrations &gt;35 ?g/m3 occur when BLH is below ~ 500 m. Paired with multiday easterly wind flow, mean model predictions surpass 40 ?g/m3 of PM10. In summer, PM10 concentrations seemingly are less driven by meteorology, but by emission or chemical particle formation processes, which are not included in the model.

We investigated the effect of measurement error in the prediction of particulate matter with diameter &lt;10 Âµm (PM10) and &lt;2.5 Âµm (PM2.5) concentrations on the estimation of health effects. Methods: We sampled 1,000 small administrative areas in London, United Kingdom, and simulated the ""true"" underlying daily exposure surfaces for PM10and PM2.5for 2009-2013 incorporating temporal variation and spatial covariance informed by the extensive London monitoring network. We added measurement error assessed by comparing measurements at fixed sites and predictions from spatiotemporal land-use regression (LUR) models; dispersion models; models using satellite data and applying machine learning algorithms; and combinations of these methods through generalized additive models. Two health outcomes were simulated to assess whether the bias varies with the effect size. We applied multilevel Poisson regression to simultaneously model the effect of long- and short-term pollutant exposure. For each scenario, we ran 1,000 simulations to assess measurement error impact on health effect estimation. Results: For long-term exposure to particles, we observed bias toward the null, except for traffic PM2.5for which only LUR underestimated the effect. For short-term exposure, results were variable between exposure models and bias ranged from -11% (underestimate) to 20% (overestimate) for PM10and of -20% to 17% for PM2.5. Integration of models performed best in almost all cases. Conclusions: No single exposure model performed optimally across scenarios. In most cases, measurement error resulted in attenuation of the effect estimate. Â© 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health.

Accurate forecasting of daily counts of hospital admissions (HAs) for CVDs is helpful to optimize medical resources. In this study, we proposed a stacking ensemble model with direct prediction strategy to predict the daily number of CVDs admissions using HAs data, air pollution data, and meteorological data. The sequential forward floating selection method with early stopping was applied for feature selection. Five machine learning models, including linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), were utilized as base learners to construct the stacking model. We compared the performance of the proposed stacking model with the five base learners in three datasets. The experimental results indicated that our model performed best in three datasets under four evaluation criteria, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Particularly, in the CVDs dataset, the MAPE is 15.103 for LR, 11.862 for SVR, 10.571 for XGBoost, 10.378 for GBDT, 10.333 for RF, and 9.679 for the stacking model. Compared with the best base learner RF, the MAPE, RMSE, and MAE of the stacking model decreased by 6.3%, 7.4%, and 6.3%, respectively, and the R2 improved by 1.7%. It is evident that the proposed stacking model can effectively forecast the daily number of hospitalizations for CVDs and provide decision support for hospital managers.

In this study, short-term prediction of PM2.5 pollution at 1, 2 and 3 hours was modelled using deep learning methods. Three deep learning algorithms and the combination thereof were evaluated: Long-short term memory units (LSTM), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Air Quality Monitoring Stations of the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization of Turkey were utilized to obtain the data. Specifically, meteorological and air pollution data were obtained from a monitoring station located in KeÃ§iÃ¶ren District of Ankara. Several trials were conducted using different combinations of RNN, GRU and LSTM models. Pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors were integrated into the model as input parameters to predict PM2.5 concentration for 1, 2 and 3 hours. Best results with R2 of 0.83, 0.7 and 0.63 for 1, 2-, and 3-hour predictions, respectively, were obtained by using a combination of GRU and RNN models.

Most estimation methods only provide ozone products at a relatively coarse resolution, such as 5 km, but high-resolution ozone data are essential for ozone pollution prevention and control. To this end, we proposed a new framework for estimating ozone concentrations at 300 m resolution in China based on Landsat 8 infrared (IR) bands and meteorological data using a deep forest (DF) model. DF combines the excellent performance of tree integration with the expressive power of hierarchical distributed representations of neural networks. The accuracy and mapping results of DF are considerably better than some widely used machine learning methods (generalized regression neural regression network and random forest). The sample-based cross-validation (CV), station-based CV, time-based CV, and extrapolation validation show that the estimations of DF are in high agreement with the station observations with determination coefficient values of 0.938, 0.926, 0.687, and 0.660, respectively. The proposed method was used to analyze the spatial and temporal ozone variations at fine scales in three typical Chinese cities (Beijing, Wuhan and Guangzhou), where the mean ozone concentrations during the polluted season are consistent with the land use and urban heat island distribution. The rationality of ozone estimates was verified, and the advantages of high-resolution mapping was demonstrated by comparing the monitoring data from municipal controlling stations in Beijing, 10 km ozone products, and satellite images. Our product can represent spatial details and locate local pollution sources, such as temples. The proposed method has important implications for the fine-scale monitoring of ozone pollution.

In the past decade, various machine learning models, especially deep learning models, have been widely used in PM2.5 remote sensing estimation and have achieved remarkable performance. However, a typical pitfall of deep learning models is the problem of high-value underestimation, i.e., the models often underestimate high-level PM2.5 concentrations. Alleviating the problem of high-value underestimation and improving the estimation ac-curacy of high PM2.5 concentrations are crucial. This study developed a new deep learning model that combines data augmentation and a particle size constraint to improve the high-level PM2.5 estimation. Based on the re-sidual neural network (ResNet), this study used random oversampling to construct a data-augmented deep re-sidual learning model (AugResNet). In addition, a deep residual neural network model with a particle size constraint was established and called ConResNet. Then, the data augmentation and particle size constraint were incorporated into the deep residual neural network model (denoted as Aug_ConResNet). We evaluated the above four models across China with the 10-fold site-based cross-validation approach. In terms of the estimation ac-curacy for high PM2.5 concentrations (> 75 mu g/m3), AugResNet (R2 = 0.813, RMSE = 19.152 mu g/m3), ConResNet (R2 = 0.796, RMSE = 20.841 mu g/m(3)) and Aug_ConResNet (R2 = 0.820, RMSE = 18.810 mu g/m3) outperformed ResNet (R2 = 0.780, RMSE = 21.628 mu g/m3).

Departing from previous machine learning studies which primarily focus on pollutant estimation based on single day-time images, our proposed deep learning model integrates Residual Network (ResNet) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), extracting spatial-temporal features of sequential images taken from smartphones instead for estimating PM2.5 and PM10 values of a particular location at a particular time. Our methodology is as follows: First, we calibrated two small portable air quality sensors using the reference instruments placed in the official air quality monitoring station, located at Central, Hong Kong (HK). Second, we verified experimentally that any PM2.5 and PM10 values obtained via our calibrated sensors remain constant within a radius of 500 meters. Third, 3024 outdoor day-time and night-time images of the same building were taken and labelled with corresponding PM2.5 and PM10 ground truth values obtained via the calibrated sensors. Fourth, the proposed ResNet-LSTM was constructed and extended by incorporating meteorological information and one short path. Results have shown that, as compared to the best baselines, ResNet-LSTM has achieved 6.56% and 6.74% reduction in MAE and SMAPE for PM2.5 estimation, and 13.25% and 11.03% reduction in MAE and SMAPE for PM10 estimation, respectively.

The emulators predict aerosol mixing state using only quantities that are predicted by the ESM, including bulk aerosol species concentrations, which do not by themselves carry mixing state information. We used PartMC-MOSAIC as the particle-resolved model and NCAR's CESM as the ESM. We trained emulators for three different mixing state indices for submicron aerosol in terms of chemical species abundance (chi(a)), the mixing of optically absorbing and nonabsorbing species (chi(o)), and the mixing of hygroscopic and nonhygroscopic species (chi(h)). Our global mixing state maps show considerable spatial and seasonal variability unique to each mixing state index. Seasonal averages varied spatially between 13% and 94% for chi(a), between 38% and 94% for chi(o), and between 20% and 87% for chi(h) with global annual averages of 67%, 68%, and 56%, respectively. High values in one index can be consistent with low values in another index depending on the grouping of species and their relative abundance, meaning that each mixing state index captures different aspects of the population mixing state. Although a direct validation with observational data has not been possible yet, our results are consistent with mixing state index values derived from ambient observations. This work is a prototypical example of using machine learning emulators to add information to ESM simulations. Plain Language Summary Earth system models (ESMs) simulations are computationally expensive, requiring highly simplified representations of aerosol mixing state, a property that describes how different aerosol chemical species are distributed among and within the aerosol particles. The assumption of whether aerosols are internally (multiple species within a particle), externally (one species per single particle), or intermediately mixed greatly influences the properties of aerosol particles and thereby the prediction of the impacts of air pollution on human health and climate change. We built simplified models using machine learning and highly detailed particle-resolved simulations to infer submicron aerosol mixing state from meteorological parameters and pollution levels. These emulators enable us to estimate the degree of aerosol mixing state at a global scale using information that ESMs track. This study provides an example of the integration of detailed aerosol process modeling and a largescale ESM via machine learning.",EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE,10.1029/2020ea001500,11,4,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Commercial gas sensors have the low-cost advantage and become key components of IoT devices in atmospheric condition monitoring. However, their native coarse resolution and poor selectivity limit their performance. Thus, we adopted recurrent neural network (RNN) models to extract the time-series concentration data characteristics and improve the detection accuracy. Firstly, four types of RNN models, LSTM and GRU, Bi-LSTM, and Bi-GRU, were optimized to define the best-performance single weak models for CO, O-3, and NO2 gases, respectively. Next, ensemble models which integrate multiple single weak models with a dynamic model were defined and trained. The testing results show that the ensemble models perform better than the single weak models. Further, a retraining procedure was proposed to make the ensemble model more flexible to adapt to environmental conditions. The significantly improved determination coefficients show that the retraining helps the ensemble models maintain long-term stable sensing performance in an atmospheric environment.

The unmanageable and mushroom growth of industries and an exponential soar in population has made the ascent of air pollution intractable. To this end, the solutions that are based on the latest technologies, such as the Internet of things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are becoming increasingly popular and they have capabilities to monitor the extent and scale of air contaminants and would be subsequently useful for containing them. With centralized cloud-based IoT platforms, the ubiquitous and continuous monitoring of air quality and data processing can be facilitated for the identification of air pollution hot spots. However, owing to the inherent characteristics of cloud, such as large end-to-end delay and bandwidth constraint, handling the high velocity and large volume of data that are generated by distributed IoT sensors would not be feasible in the longer run. To address these issues, fog computing is a powerful paradigm, where the data are processed and filtered near the end of the IoT nodes and it is useful for improving the quality of service (QoS) of IoT network. To further improve the QoS, a conceptual model of distributed fog computing and a machine learning based data processing and analysis model is proposed for the optimal utilization of cloud resources. The proposed model provides a classification accuracy of 99% while using a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. This model is also simulated in iFogSim toolkit.

Launched in 2017, TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) provides a high spatial resolution (similar to 5 km) tropospheric air quality measurement that captures the spatial variability of air pollution, but still limited by its daily overpass in the temporal dimension and relatively short historical records. Integrating with the hourly available AirNOWobservations by ground-level discrete stations, we proposed and compared two deep learning methods that learn the relationship between the ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observation from AirNOW and the tropospheric NO2 column density from TROPOMI to downscale the daily NO2 to an hourly resolution. The input predictors include the locations of AirNOW stations, AirNOW NO2 observations, boundary layer height, other meteorological status, elevation, major roads, and power plants. The learned relationship can be used to produce NO2 emission estimates at the sub-urban scale on an hourly basis. The two methods include 1) an integrated method between inverse weighted distance and a feed forward neural network (IDW+ DNN), and 2) a deep matrix network (DMN) that maps the discrete AirNOWobservations directly to the distribution of TROPOMI observations. Wefurther compared the accuracies of both models using different configurations of input predictors and validated their average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the spatial distribution of errors. Results show that DMN generates more reliable NO2 estimates and captures a better spatial distribution of NO2 concentrations than the IDW+ DNN model. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a novel deep learning model based on convolutional neural network architecture was developed to estimate ground-level ozone concentrations across eastern China. A high-resolution maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) surface ground ozone concentration dataset was generated with the support of the total ozone column from the satellite Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, meteorological data from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System, and simulations of the WRF-Chem model. The modeled results were compared with in situ measurements in five cities that were not involved in model training, and the mean R2 of predicted ozone with observed values was 0.9, indicating the good robustness of our model. In addition, we compared the model results with some widely used machine learning techniques (e.g., random forest) and recently published ozone datasets, showing that the accuracy of our model is higher and that the spatial distributions of predicted ozone are more coherent. This study provides an efficient and exact method to estimate ground-level ozone and offers a new perspective for modeling spatiotemporal air pollutants. Â© 2022 by the authors.

However, official insight is hampered by the Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) procedure conducted in the laboratory annually. It not only has a large gap to real-world situations (e.g., meteorological conditions) but also is incapable of regular supervision. Here we build a unique dataset including 103,831 light-duty gasoline vehicles, in which on-road remote sensing (ORRS) measurements are linked to the I/M records based on the vehicle identification numbers and license plates. On this basis, we develop an ensemble model framework that integrates three machining learning algorithms, including neural network (NN), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest (RF). We demonstrate that this ensemble model could rapidly assess the vehicle-specific emissions (i.e., CO, HC, and NO). In particular, the model performs quite well for the passing vehicles under normal conditions (i.e., lower VSP (<18 kw/t), temperature (6-32 degrees C), relative humidity (<80%), and wind speed (<5 m/s)). Together with the current emission standard, we identify a large number of the 'dirty' (2.33%) or 'clean' (74.92%) vehicles in the real world. Our results show that the ORRS measurements, assisted by the machine-learning-based ensemble model developed here, can realize day-to-day supervision of on-road vehicle-specific emissions.

However, due to the ""black-box"" nature of deep learning, it is difficult to obtain trustworthy deep learning models when considering meteorological conditions in air quality prediction. To address the above problem, in this paper, we reveal the influence of meteorological conditions on air quality prediction by utilizing explainable deep learning. In this paper, (1) the source data from air pollutant datasets, including PM2.5, PM10, SO2 hourly concentration, and the meteorological condition datasets measuring the temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure are obtained; (2) the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models are established for air quality prediction in 4 conditions; (3) the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method is employed to analyze the explainability of the air quality prediction models. We find that the prediction accuracy is not improved by considering only meteorological conditions. However, when combining meteorological conditions with other air pollutants, the prediction accuracy is higher than considering other air pollutants. In addition, the largest contribution to air quality prediction is atmospheric pressure, followed by humidity and temperature. The reason for the different accuracies of the prediction may because of the interaction between meteorological conditions and other air pollutants.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess whether greenness surrounding schools was associated with visual impairment prevalence and visual acuity levels in Chinese schoolchildren and whether the associations might he explained by reduced air pollution. METHODS: In September 2013, we recruited 61,995 children and adolescents 6-18 years of age from 94 schools in seven provinces/municipalities in China. Greenness exposure was assessed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) from July to August 2013. Visual impairment was defined as at least one visual acuity level (dimensionless) lower than 4.9 (Snellen 5/6 equivalent). Three-year annual averages of particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of <= 1 mu m (PM1) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at each school were assessed using machine learning methods. We used generalized linear mixed models to estimate the associations between greenness and prevalent visual impairment and visual acuity levels and used mediation analyses to explore the potential mediating role of air pollution. RESULTS: In the adjusted model, an interquartile range increase in N DVI500m was associated with lower odds of prevalent visual impairment [odds ratio (OR) = 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93, 0971] The same increase in NDVI500m was also associated with 0.012 (95% CI: 0.008, 0.015) and 0.011 (95% CI: 0.007, 0.015) increases in visual acuity levels for left- and right-eye, respectively. Our results also suggested that PM1 and NO2 significantly mediated the association between NDVI500m and visual impairment. Similar effect estimates were observed for SAVI(500m) and our estimates were generally robust in several sensitivity analyses. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest higher greenness surrounding schools might reduce the risk of visual impairment, possibly owing in part to lower PM1 and NO2 in vegetated areas. Further longitudinal studies with more precise greenness assessment are warranted to confirm these findings.",ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES,10.1289/ehp8429,12,4,No,,,,"Peoples R China,Australia,Poland,Germany,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a large population-based study to evaluate the interaction effects between influenza vaccination and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution on allergic respiratory diseases in children and adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study was investigated during 2012-2013 in 94 schools from Seven Northeastern Cities (SNEC) in China. Questionnaires surveys were obtained from 56 137 children and adolescents aged 2-17 years. Influenza vaccination was defined as receipt of the influenza vaccine. We estimated air pollutants exposure [nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <= 1 mu m (PM1), <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and <= 10 mu m (PM10)] using machine learning methods. We employed two-level generalized linear mix effects model to examine interactive effects between influenza vaccination and air pollution exposure on allergic respiratory diseases (asthma, asthma-related symptoms and allergic rhinitis), after controlling for important covariates. Results: We found statistically significant interactions between influenza vaccination and air pollutants on allergic respiratory diseases and related symptoms (doctor-diagnosed asthma, current wheeze, wheeze, persistent phlegm and allergic rhinitis). The adjusted ORs for doctor-diagnosed asthma, current wheeze and allergic rhinitis among the unvaccinated group per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM1 and PM2.5 were significantly higher than the corresponding ORs among the vaccinated group [For PM 1 , doctor-diagnosed asthma: OR: 1.89 (95%CI: 1.57-2.27) vs 1.65 (95%CI: 1.36-2.00); current wheeze: OR: 1.50 (95%CI: 1.22-1.85) vs 1.10 (95%CI: 0.89-1.37); allergic rhinitis: OR: 1.38 (95%CI: 1.15-1.66) vs 1.21 (95%CI: 1.00-1.46). For PM2.5, doctor-diagnosed asthma: OR: 1.81 (95%CI: 1.52-2.14) vs 1.57 (95%CI: 1.32 -1.88); current wheeze: OR: 1.46 (95%CI: 1.21-1.76) vs 1.11 (95%CI: 0.91-1.35); allergic rhinitis: OR: 1.35 (95%CI: 1.14-1.60) vs 1.19 (95%CI: 1.00-1.42)]. The similar patterns were observed for wheeze and persistent phlegm. The corresponding p values for interactions were less than 0.05, respectively. We assessed the risks of PM 1 -related and PM 2 . 5 -related current wheeze were decreased by 26.67% (95%CI: 1.04%-45.66%) and 23.97% (95%CI: 0.21%-42.08%) respectively, which was attributable to influenza vaccination (both p for efficiency <0.05). Conclusions: Influenza vaccination may play an important role in mitigating the detrimental effects of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution on childhood allergic respiratory diseases. Policy targeted at increasing influenza vaccination may yield co-benefits in terms of reduced allergic respiratory diseases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It might only represent a certain area and not the entire city due to the locations and limited number of monitoring stations. Nowadays, a mobile sensing is becoming an alternative option to monitor air quality in urban environment due to its ease of use, high flexibility, and low price. This paper develops a vehicular-based mobile monitoring system for real time air quality sensing and visualization across large cities with high spatial resolution. The commercially available low-cost CO, NO2, NH3O3, CH4, SO2, PMx, temperature and humidity sensors along with the microcontroller and GPS were integrated in a sensing device installed on the roof of taxi and sport utility vehicle (SUV). The developed device was calibrated through a reference monitoring station and validated through field measurement. We first split the entire city with a uniform grid discretization. We then propose a data processing methodology based on machine learning algorithms for generating 250 representative data set from 286 million data which is collected using the vehicular based mobile sensors. Next we present the representativeness of the data set by comparison of stationary data and mobile data. We also describe the analytical results and spatial distribution with high spatial resolution throughout the city. In addition, the collected mobile sensor data is also used to show that the significant differences and spatial variability in mean levels per street. Finally, we conclude that the proposed mobile monitoring system using high spatial resolution can effectively map the air quality in metropolitan environment and provide detail about the spatial variability that cannot be done with stationary monitoring systems.",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,10.1007/s10661-021-09139-2,11,4,No,,,,South Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Residential greenness is benefits health by promoting physical activity, reducing air pollution, and improving mental health, but it remains unclear whether it is related to androgen and progesterone levels among humans. Aims: This study aimed to explore the individual and interactive effects of PM and residential greenness on serum testosterone and progesterone levels among rural Chinese adults. Methods: A total of 6017 subjects were recruited from the baseline of the Henan Rural Cohort Study in 2016. Serum testosterone and progesterone were measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Particulate matters (PM) (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) were assessed by machine learning algorithms.

Results: After adjusting for potential confounding factors, a 1 & micro;g/m3 increase in PM2.5 or PM10 was associated with a 0.037 or 0.030 ng/ml increase in serum testosterone, respectively, in females and with a 0.111 or 0.182 ng/ml decrease in serum progesterone, respectively, in males.

However, the complexity of O 3 formation mechanisms in the troposphere presents a significant challenge in modeling O 3 accurately and quickly, especially in the absence of a process model. Data-driven machine-learning techniques have demonstrated promising performance in modeling air pollution, mainly when a process model is unavailable. This study evaluates the predictive performance of nineteen machine learning models for ozone pollution prediction. Specifically, we assess how incorporating features using Random Forest affects O 3 concentration prediction and investigate using time-lagged measurements to improve prediction accuracy. Air pollution and meteorological data collected at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology are used. Results show that dynamic models using time-lagged data outperform static and reduced machine learning models.

The latest hyperparameter optimization techniques were used to learn air pollution characteristics from ambient PM2.5-related information, such as time, meteorology, and air pollutant concentrations. We compared the feature extraction abilities of the four models. The prediction accuracy identified by the coefficient of determination (R2) between prediction and observation was highest in GAIN, followed by FCDNN and RF or kNN. On availability of data on the time, air pollutant concentrations, and/or meteorology, simultaneously missed 20 % data of all PM2.5 constituent groups were predicted, with R2 = 0.897, 0.861, 0.785, and 0.801 by the GAIN, FCDNN, RF, and kNN, respectively. As missing ratios (20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 %) of input data increased, prediction accuracy decreased in the four models and was predominantly more noticeable in GAIN and kNN. As the available period of data increased, prediction accuracy increased in GAIN and FCDNN. Trace elements were predicted with the lowest R2 in all models among the target constituent groups. Study sites with more emission sources showed lower prediction accuracy, resulting in the highest R2 in Baengnyeong island and the lowest in Ulsan. According to the current findings, ML models can be used to evaluate various air pollution issues for which data is missing. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Expert Systems with Applications,10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119696,4,4,No,,,,"South Korea,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we proposed a recurrent neural network based on a double-stage attention mechanism model to predict ozone, selected an appropriate time series for prediction through the input attention and temporal attention mechanisms, and analyzed the cause of ozone generation according to the contribution of feature parameters. The experimental data show that our model had an RMSE of 7.71 µg/m3 and a mean absolute error of 5.97 µg/m3 for 1-h predictions. The DA-RNN model predicted ozone closer to observations than the other models. Based on the importance of the characteristics, we found that the ozone pollution in the Jinshan Industrial Zone mainly comes from the emissions of petrochemical enterprises, and the good generalization performance of the model is proved through testing multiple stations. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity and promising application of the DA-RNN model in predicting atmospheric pollutants and investigating their causes.

City-wide networks for air pollution monitoring based on low-cost sensors are promising to provide real-time data with detail and scale never before possible. However, they still present limitations preventing their ubiquitous use. Thus, this study aimed to perform a post-deployment validation and calibration based on two step methods for ozone low-cost sensor of a city-wide network for air pollution and meteorology monitoring using low-cost sensors focusing on the main challenges. Four of the 23 data collection units (DCUs) of the UrbanSense network installed in Porto city (Portugal) with low-cost sensors for particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity, luminosity, precipitation, and wind speed and direction) were evaluated. This study identified post-deployment challenges related to their validation and calibration. The preliminary validation showed that PM, CO and precipitation sensors recorded only unreliable data, and other sensors (wind speed and direction) very few data. A multi-step calibration strategy was implemented: inter-DCU calibration (1st step, for O3, temperature and relative humidity) and calibration with a reference-grade instrument (2nd step, for O3). In the 1st step, multivariate linear regression (MLR) resulted in models with better performance than non-linear models such as artificial neural networks (errors almost zero and R2 > 0.80). In the 2nd step, the calibration models using non-linear machine learning boosting algorithms, namely Stochastic Gradient Boosting Regressor (both with the default and post-tuning hyper-parameters), performed better than artificial neural networks and linear regression approaches. The calibrated O3 data resulted in a marginal improvement from the raw data, with error values close to zero, with low predictability (R2 ∼ 0.32). The lessons learned with the present study evidenced the need to redesign the calibration strategy. Thus, a novel multi-step calibration strategy is proposed, based on two steps (pre and post-deployment calibration). When performed cyclically and continuously, this strategy reduces the need for reference instruments, while probably minimising data drifts over time. More experimental campaigns are needed to collect more data and further improve calibration models. © 2022 The Authors",Journal of Environmental Management,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116910,4,4,No,,,,Portugal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Areas with high potential for radon exposure must be identified to implement cost-effective radon mitigation plans successfully or to prevent the construction of unsafe buildings. In this study, an indoor radon potential map of Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea, was generated using a group method of data handling (GMDH) algorithm based on local soil properties, geogenic, geochemical, as well as topographic factors. To optimally tune the hyper-parameters of GMDH and enhance the prediction accuracy of modelling radon distribution, the GMDH model was integrated with two metaheuristic optimization algorithms, namely the bat (BA) and cuckoo optimization (COA) algorithms. The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of the models was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and standard deviation (StD). The results indicated that the GMDH-COA model outperformed the other models in the training (AUC = 0.852, MSE = 0.058, RMSE = 0.242, StD = 0.242) and testing (AUC = 0.844, MSE = 0.060, RMSE = 0.246, StD = 0.0242) phases. Additionally, using metaheuristic optimization algorithms improved the predictive ability of the GMDH. The GMDH-COA model showed that approximately 7 % of the total area of Chungcheongnam-do consists of very high radon-prone areas. The information gain ratio method was used to assess the predictive ability of considered factors. As expected, soil properties and local geology significantly affected the spatial distribution of radon potential levels. The radon potential map produced in this study represents the first stage of identifying areas where large proportions of residential buildings are expected to experience significant radon levels due to high concentrations of natural radioisotopes in rocks and derived soils beneath building foundations. The generated map assists local authorities to develop urban plans more wisely towards region with less radon concentrations. © 2022",Environment International,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107724,4,4,No,,,,"South Korea,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary objective of this project was to establish a relationship between air pollution and meteorological conditions. The ERA-5 data together with the NO2 TVCD product and auxiliary data were further assimilated into an artificial intelligence model in order to estimate surface NO2 concentrations. The results revealed that the random forest method was the most accurate method for estimating the surface NO2. The random forest model demonstrated MAE values of 3.4 μg/m3 (MAPE~37%) and 3.2 μg/m3 (MAPE~31%) for the hourly and weekly estimates, respectively. It was observed that the proposed model could be used for at least 120 days per year due to the cloud-free conditions. Further, it was found that the S-5P NO2 TVCD was the most important variable, which explained more than 50% of the predictions. Other important variables were the nightlights, solar radiation flux, road density, population, and planetary boundary layer height.

Accurate and reasonable prediction of the emission of atmospheric pollutants from single enterprise can determine the exact source of atmospheric pollutants and control atmospheric pollution precisely. Based on China’s coking enterprises in 2020, we proposed a quantitative method for pollutant emission standards and introduced the quantification results of pollutant emission standards (QRPES) into the construction of support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) prediction methods for SO2 emission of coking enterprises in China. The results show that, affected by the types of coke ovens and regions, China’s current coking enterprises have implemented a total of 21 emission standards, with marked differences. After adding QRPES, it was found that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of SVR and RFR decreased from 0.055 kt/a and 0.059 kt/a to 0.045 kt/a and 0.039 kt/a, and the R2 increased from 0.890 and 0.881 to 0.926 and 0.945, respectively. This shows that the QRPES can greatly improve the prediction accuracy, and the SO2 emissions of each enterprise are highly correlated with the strictness of standards. The predicted result shows that 45% of SO2 emissions from Chinese coking enterprises are concentrated in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Hebei provinces in central China. The method created in this paper fills in the blank of forecasting method of air pollutant emission intensity of single enterprise and is of great help to the accurate control of air pollutants.

However, their relative importance in crop yields remains elusive, especially in heavily polluted regions. Here we develop crop yield prediction models, based on a large volume of historical crop data, as well as climate and pollution records in China since 1980. A long-term surface ozone concentration data set is developed from a machine-learning model and various observations. An assessment of four climate and pollution factors reveals the critical role of particulate and ozone pollution in regulating interannual variations of crop yields in China. During 2010–2018, we find that the particulate pollution mitigation outweighs the negative impacts of concurrent climate change, resulting in 0.5%–1.9% net yield increases nationwide, despite of the ozone increases in the North China Plain. Looking to the future, the impacts of climate change, particularly from surface temperature increase, will dominate over pollution factors and profoundly reduce future maize and rice yields by 0.6 to 2.8% 10 yr−1 by 2050.

Ships play a significant role in coastal air pollution, in conjunction with transport mobility in the broader area of ports. As such, ports should be monitored in order to assess air pollution levels and act accordingly. In this paper, we obtain CO values from environmental sensors that were installed in the broader area of the port of Igoumenitsa in Greece. Initially, we analysed the CO values and we have identified some extreme values in the dataset that showed a potential event. Thereafter, we separated the dataset into 6-h intervals and showed that we have an extremely high rise in certain hours. We transformed the dataset to a moving average dataset, with the objective being the reduction of the extremely high values. We utilised a machine-learning algorithm, namely the univariate long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm to provide the predicted outcome of the time series from the port that has been collected.

In the present study, multi-source data were combined to map the distribution of the AQI and population data, and the analyze their pollution population exposure of Beijing in 2018 was analyzed. Machine learning based on the random forest algorithm was adopted to calculate the monthly average AQI of Beijing in 2018. Using Luojia-1 nighttime light remote sensing data, population statistics data, the population of Beijing in 2018 and point of interest data, the distribution of the permanent population in Beijing was estimated with a high precision of 200 m x 200 m. Based on the spatialization results of the AQI and population of Beijing, the air pollution exposure levels in various parts of Beijing were calculated using the population-weighted pollution exposure level (PWEL) formula. The results show that the southern region of Beijing had a more serious level of air pollution, while the northern region was less polluted. At the same time, the population was found to agglomerate mainly in the central city and the peripheric areas thereof. In the present study, the exposure of different districts and towns in Beijing to pollution was analyzed, based on high resolution population spatialization data, it could take the pollution exposure issue down to each individual town. And we found that towns with higher exposure such as Yongshun Town, Shahe Town and Liyuan Town were all found to have a population of over 200 000 which was much higher than the median population of townships of 51 741 in Beijing. Additionally, the change trend of air pollution exposure levels in various regions of Beijing in 2018 was almost the same, with the peak value being in winter and the lowest value being in summer.

Associations in rural areas are still unclear and there is growing interest in testing the role that air pollution has on other causes of death. This study aims to evaluate the association between daily air pollution and cause-specific mortality in all 8092 Italian municipalities. Methods: Natural, cardiovascular, cardiac, ischemic, cerebrovascular, respiratory, metabolic, diabetes, nervous and psychiatric causes of death occurred in Italy were extracted during 2013-2015. Daily ambient PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were estimated through machine learning algorithms. The associations between air pollutants and cause-specific mortality were estimated with a time-series approach using a two-stage analytic protocol where area-specific over-dispersed Poisson regression models where fit in the first stage, followed by a meta-analysis in the second. We tested for effect modification by sex, age class and the degree of urbanisation of the municipality. Results: We estimated a positive association between PM10 and PM2.5 and the mortality from natural, cardio-vascular, cardiac, respiratory and nervous system causes, but not with metabolic or psychiatric causes of death. In particular, mortality from nervous diseases increased by 4.55% (95% CI: 2.51-6.63) and 9.64% (95% CI: 5.76-13.65) for increments of 10 mu g/m3 in PM10 and PM2.5 (lag 0-5 days), respectively.

Higher associations with natural mortality were found among the elderly, while there were no differential effects between sex or between rural and urban areas. Conclusions: Short-term exposure to particulate matter was associated with mortality from nervous diseases. Mortality from metabolic diseases was associated with NO2 exposure.

Therefore, the measurement of harmful elements and identification their pollution degree in atmospheric particulate matter are of great significance. In this research, taking the pollution grade of metal elements divided by the values of enrichment factor (EF) as the research target, we established the novelty method of LIBS combined with machine learning methods for fast and accurate discrimination of the pollution grade of metal elements in atmospherically deposited particulate matter. Firstly, the LIBS spectra of 17 atmospherically deposited particulate matter samples were measured, and the main metal elements were identified by national institute of standards and technology (NIST) database. Next, the concentration of main metal elements (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr and V) was obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and then the pollution grade of metal elements was classified according to the EF value. Then the PCA method was applied, and it was found that PCA could not distinguish the samples with different pollution grades of metal elements. In order to improve the accuracy of discriminant analysis, the RF discriminant model was established for discriminant analysis of the pollution grade of metal elements, with emphasis on the influence of different pretreatment methods on the accuracy of RF discriminant model. Finally, under the optimal conditions of optimal spectral preprocessing method and model parameters, the RF and PLS-DA discriminant models were constructed for the discrimination of the pollution grade of metal elements. The results showed that compared with PCA and PLS-DA discriminant models, RF discriminant model had high accuracy discriminant results. For Zn discriminant analysis (Grade-3 and Grade-4) of prediction set, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 0.9200, 0.9000, 0.9333, respectively.

Although environmental factors are interrelated, studies considering the exposome are lacking. We simultaneously assessed a variety of exposures in their association with prevalent T2D by applying penalised regression Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approaches. We contrasted the findings with single-exposure models including consistently associated risk factors reported by previous studies. Methods: Baseline data (n = 14,829) of the Occupational and Environmental Health Cohort study (AMIGO) were enriched with 85 exposome factors (air pollution, noise, built environment, neighbourhood socio-economic factors etc.) using the home addresses of participants. Questionnaires were used to identify participants with T2D (n = 676(4.6 %)). Models in all applied statistical approaches were adjusted for individual-level socio-demographic variables. Results: Lower average home values, higher share of non-Western immigrants and higher surface temperatures were related to higher risk of T2D in the multivariable models (LASSO, RF). Selected variables differed between the two multi-variable approaches, especially for weaker predictors. Some established risk factors (air pollutants) appeared in univariate analysis but were not among the most important factors in multivariable analysis. Other established factors (green space) did not appear in univariate, but appeared in multivariable analysis (RF). Average estimates of the prediction error (logLoss) from nested cross-validation showed that the LASSO outperformed both RF and ANN approaches. Conclusions: Neighbourhood socio-economic and socio-demographic characteristics and surface temperature were consistently associated with the risk of T2D. For other physical-chemical factors associations differed per analytical approach.

In particular, Particulate Matter (PM2.5) is considered a hazardous air pollutant to human health. Accurate hourly forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is thus of significant importance for public health, helping the citizens to plan the measures to alleviate the harmful effects of air pollution on health. This study analyses and discusses the temporal characteristics of PM2.5 at different locations in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam - an economic center and a megacity in a developing country with a population of 8.99 million people. We developed several AI-based one-shot multi-step PM2.5 forecasting models, with both an hourly forecast granularity (1 h to 24 h) and a 24-h rolling mean. These Machine Learning algorithms include Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor, hybrid 1D CNN-LSTM, eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Prophet. We collected the data from six monitoring stations installed by the HealthyAir project partners at different locations in HCMC, including traffic, residential and industrial areas in the city. In addition, we developed a suitable model training protocol using data from a short period to address the non-stationarity of PM2.5 time series. Our proposed PM2.5 forecasting models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and will be deployed in our HealthyAir mobile app to warn HCMC citizens of air pollution issues in the city.

Among the different airborne pollutants, heavy metals (HMs) are particularly relevant because they are bioaccumulated, impairing the functions of living beings. This study aimed to establish a method to predict heavy metal concentrations in leaves and road dust, through their magnetic properties measurements. For this purpose, machine learning, automatic linear regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to establish models for the prediction of airborne heavy metals based on leaves and road dust magnetic properties. Road dust samples and leaves of two common evergreen species (Cupressus lusitanica/Casuarina equisetifolia) were sampled simultaneously during two different years in the Great Metropolitan Area (GMA) of Costa Rica. MLR and SVM algorithms were used to establish the relationship between airborne heavy metal concentrations based on single (?lf) and multiple (?lf y ?df) leaf magnetic properties and road dust. Results showed that Fe, Cu, Cr, V, and Zn concentrations were well-simulated by SVM prediction models, with adjusted R2 values ? 0.7 in both training and test stages. By contrast, the concentrations of Pb and Ni were not well-simulated, with adjusted R2 values &lt; 0.7 in both training and test stages. Heavy metal predicciÃ³n models using magnetic properties of leaves from Casuarina equisetifolia, as collectors, yielded better prediction results than those based on the leaves of Cupressus lusitanica and road dust, showing relatively higher adjusted R2 values and lower errors (MAE and RMSE) in both training and test stages. SVM proved to be the best prediction model with variations between single (?lf) and multiple (?lf y ?df) magnetic properties depending on the element studied.

High-intensity pollution emissions and unfavorable weather conditions are the key factors for the formation and development of air heavy pollution processes. Given that research into air quality prediction generally ignore pollutant emission information, in this paper, the random forest supervised learning algorithm is used to construct an air quality prediction model for Zhangdian District with industrial waste gas daily emissions and meteorological factors as variables. The training data include the air quality index (AQI) values, meteorological factors and industrial waste gas daily emission of Zhangdian District from 1st January 2017 to 30th November 2019. The data from 1st to 31th December 2019 is used as the test set to assess the model. The performance of the model is analysed and compared with the backpropagation (BP) neural network, decision tree, and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) function, which has better overall prediction performance with an RMSE of 22.91 and an MAE of 15.80. Based on meteorological forecasts and expected air quality, a daily emission limit for industrial waste gas can be obtained using model inversion. From 1st to 31th December 2019, if the industrial waste gas daily emission in this area were decreased from 6048.5 million cubic meters of waste gas to 5687.5 million cubic meters, and the daily air quality would be maintained at a good level. This paper deeply explores the dynamic relationship between waste gas daily emissions of industrial enterprises, meteorological factors, and air quality. The meteorological conditions are fully utilized to dynamically adjust the exhaust gas emissions of key polluting enterprises. It not only ensures that the regional air quality is in good condition, but also promotes the in-depth optimization of the procedures of regional industrial enterprises, and reduces the conflict between environmental protection and economic development.

It is important to consider the spatial characteristics of the data, as they allow us to infer predictions in those areas for which no information is available. In the current literature, there are a large number of proposals for spatio-temporal air pollution forecasting. In this paper we propose a novel spatio-temporal approach based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for the identification of multiple non-dominated linear regression models and their combination in an ensemble learning model for air pollution forecasting. The ability of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to find a Pareto front of solutions is used to build multiple forecast models geographically distributed in the area of interest. The proposed method has been applied for one-week NO2 prediction in southeastern Spain and has obtained promising results in statistical comparison with other approaches such as the union of datasets or the interpolation of the predictions for each monitoring station. The validity of the proposed spatio-temporal approach is thus demonstrated, opening up a new field in air pollution engineering.

Based on the domain knowledge about air pollution, we propose a deep neural network based approach, entitled DeepAir. Our approach consists of a deep distributed fusion network for station-level short-term prediction and a deep cascaded fusion network for the city-level long-term forecast. With the data transformation preprocessing, the former network adopts a neural distributed architecture to fuse heterogeneous urban data for simultaneously capturing the direct and indirect factors affecting air quality. The latter network takes a neural cascaded architecture to learn the dynamic influences from previously existing data and future predicted data on future air quality. We have deployed a real-time system on the cloud, providing fine-grained air quality forecasts for 300+ Chinese cities every hour. Our system mainly consists of three components: data crawler, task scheduler, and prediction model, which are implemented with a multi-task architecture to improve the system's efficiency and stability.

We developed prediction models for short-term UFP exposures using street-level images collected by a camera installed on a vehicle rooftop, paired with air quality measurements conducted during a large-scale mobile monitoring campaign in Toronto, Canada. Convolutional neural network models were trained to extract traffic and built environment features from images. These features, along with regional air quality and meteorology data were used to predict short-term UFP concentration as a continuous and categorical variable. A gradient boost model for UFP as a continuous variable achieved R2 = 0.66 and RMSE = 9391.8#/cm3 (mean values for 10-fold cross-validation). The model predicting categorical UFP achieved accuracies for ""Low""and ""High""UFP of 77 and 70%, respectively. The presence of trucks and other traffic parameters were associated with higher UFPs, and the spatial distribution of elevated short-term UFP followed the distribution of single-unit trucks. This study demonstrates that pictures captured on urban streets, associated with regional air quality and meteorology, can adequately predict short-term UFP exposure.

In this study, the influence of such evolution on on-road emissions was investigated based on a comprehensive dataset encompassing vehicle fleet composition, demographic, economic, and energy features from a representative small-medium automotive city in North America. The decoupling analysis was carried out to assess the dynamic linkage between environmental pressure exerted by the transportation sector and economic growth at both city level and national level in North America. We also developed an approach that supports the long-term traffic-related air pollutant prediction and investigated the potential influence on urban air quality. A sharp upward trajectory was observed in the quantity of SUVs from 2001 to 2018, gradually replacing the dominance of the quantity of four-door cars. There was a significant shift in the GHG emissions emitted from vehicle types used for passenger transport: emissions from SUVs and trucks rose by 374.0% and 69.3%, respectively, whereas emissions from four-door cars, two-door cars, station wagons, and vans all decreased. The changes in vehicle composition, along with the steady trend in GHG emissions from private fleet and decrease in on-road air pollutant concentrations found in Regina, were a response to the establishment of federal fuel economy standards and improved fuel economy. Relative decoupling was observed in aggregate for Regina and Canada in most of the years while both experienced economic downturns and increases in environmental pressure in the form of emissions from 2014 to 2015.

CiteSpace 5.8.R1 was used to analyze countries/regions, institutions, authors, keywords and references cited, and to reveal hot spots and frontiers of AI in atmospheric pollution. Results: Beginning in 1994, publications on AI in air pollution have increased in number, with a surge in research since 2017. The leading country and institution were China (N = 524) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (N = 58), followed by the United States (N = 455) and Tsinghua University (N = 33), respectively. In addition, the United States (0.24) and the England (0.27) showed a high degree of centrality. Most of the identified articles were published in journals related to environmental science; the most cited journal was Atmospheric Environment, which reached nearly 1,000 citations. There were few collaborations among authors, institutions and countries. The hot topics were machine learning, air pollution and deep learning. The majority of the researchers concentrated on air pollutant concentration prediction, particularly the combined use of AI and environmental science methods, low-cost air quality sensors, indoor air quality, and thermal comfort.

PM2.5 is a key factor affecting air quality. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of PM2.5 concentration and make people effectively control the generation and propagation of atmospheric pollutants, in this paper, a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) model based on principal component analysis (PCA) and attention mechanism (attention) is constructed, which first uses PCA to reduce the dimension of data, eliminate the correlation effect between indicators, and reduce model complexity, and then uses the extracted principal components to establish a PCA-attention-LSTM model. Simulation experiments were conducted on the air pollutant data, meteorological element data, and working day data of five cities in Ningxia from 2018 to 2020 to predict the PM2.5 concentration. The PCA-attention-LSTM model is compared with the support vector regression model (SVR), AdaBoost model, random forest model (RF), BP neural network model (BPNN), and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM). The results show that the PCA-attention-LSTM model is optimal; the correlation coefficients of the PCA-attention-LSTM model in Wuzhong, Yinchuan, Zhongwei, Shizuishan, and Guyuan are 0.91, 0.93, 0.91, 0.91, and 0.90, respectively, and the SVR model is the worst.

Combining a camera with deep learning (hereafter referred to as deep vision-based occupancy counting) is a very effective method for occupancy counting, but there are not many studies evaluating its experimental performance. Furthermore, there are insufficient studies on implementing control using deep vision. The purpose of this study was to experimentally evaluate the performance of deep vision-based occupancy counting and to implement deep vision-based OCC in reality. First, we evaluated the performance of deep vision-based occupancy counting for six offices. Second, we implemented a deep vision-based energy recovery ventilator control strategy in a small office and compared the indoor air quality and energy consumption with those from traditional control strategies. As a result, deep vision-based occupancy counting showed significantly higher performance (root mean square error (RMSE): 0.883, normalized RMSE (NRMSE): 0.141). The larger the floor area, the more frequently the prediction of the number of occupants was lower than the actual number. The control results showed that deep vision-based ventilation control could properly maintain the indoor CO2 concentration with 24Â35% lower ventilation rates compared to traditional ventilation control strategies.

Epidemiological evidence reports positive associations between BC and cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Despite this, BC is currently not regulated by the EU Air Quality Directive, and as a result BC data are not available in urban areas from reference air quality monitoring networks in many countries. To fill this gap, a machine learning approach is proposed to develop a BC proxy using air pollution datasets as an input. The proposed BC proxy is based on two machine learning models, support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF), using observations of particle mass and number concentrations (N), gaseous pollutants and meteorological variables as the input. Experimental data were collected from a reference station in Barcelona (Spain) over a 2-year period (2018Â2019). Two months of additional data were available from a second urban site in Barcelona, for model validation. BC concentrations estimated by SVR showed a high degree of correlation with the measured BC concentrations (R2 = 0.828) with a relatively low error (RMSE = 0.48 ?g/m3). Model performance was dependent on seasonality and time of the day, due to the influence of new particle formation events. When validated at the second station, performance indicators decreased (R2 = 0.633; RMSE = 1.19 ?g/m3) due to the lack of N data and PM2.5 and the smaller size of the dataset (2 months). New particle formation events critically impacted model performance, suggesting that its application would be optimal in environments where traffic is the main source of ultrafine particles. Due to its flexibility, it is concluded that the model can act as a BC proxy, even based on EU-regulatory air quality parameters only, to complement experimental measurements for exposure assessment in urban areas.

Predicting indoor PM2.5 concentrations is essential to achieve acceptable indoor air quality. This study aims to investigate data-driven models to accurately predict PM 2.5 pollution. Notably, a comparative study has been conducted between twenty-one machine learning and deep learning models to predict PM2.5 levels. Specifically, we investigate the performance of machine learning and deep learning models to predict ambient PM2.5 concentrations based on other ambient pollutants, including SO (Formula presented.), NO (Formula presented.), O (Formula presented.), CO, and PM10. Here, we applied Bayesian optimization to optimally tune hyperparameters of the Gaussian process regression with different kernels and ensemble learning models (i.e., boosted trees and bagged trees) and investigated their prediction performance. Furthermore, to further enhance the forecasting performance of the investigated models, dynamic information has been incorporated by introducing lagged measurements in the construction of the considered models. Results show a significant improvement in the prediction performance when considering dynamic information from past data. Moreover, three methods, namely, random forest (RF), decision tree, and extreme gradient boosting, are applied to assess variables contribution and revealed that lagged PM2.5 data contribute significantly to the prediction performance and enables the construction of parsimonious models. Hourly concentration levels of ambient air pollution from the air quality monitoring network located in Seoul are employed to verify the prediction effectiveness of the studied models. Six measurements of effectiveness are used for assessing the prediction quality. Results showed that deep learning models are more efficient than the other investigated machine learning models (i.e., SVR, GPR, bagged and boosted trees, RF, and XGBoost). Also, the results showed that the bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) and bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) networks produce higher performance than the investigated machine learning models (i.e., SVR, GPR, bagged and boosted trees, RF, and XGBoost) and deep learning models (i.e., LSTM, GRU, and convolutional neural network).

However, a major air pollution problem is particulate matter (PM), which is an adverse effect of wildfires and open burning. Application tools for air pollution monitoring in risk areas using real-time monitoring with drones have emerged. A new air quality index (AQI) for monitoring and display, such as three-dimensional (3D) mapping based on data assessment, is essential for timely environmental surveying. The objective of this paper is to present a 3D AQI mapping data assessment using a hybrid model based on a machine-learning method for drone real-time air pollution monitoring (Dr-TAPM). Dr-TAPM was designed by equipping drones with multi-environmental sensors for carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5,10), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), with data pre- and post-processing with the hybrid model. The hybrid model for data assessment was proposed using backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. Experimentally, we considered a case study detecting smoke emissions from an open burning scenario. As a result, PM2.5,10 and CO were detected as air pollutants from open burning. 3D AQI map locations were shown and the validation learning rates were apparent, as the accuracy of predicted AQI data assessment was 98%.

However, O3 concentrations simulated by the available climate models exhibit significant variances, indicating the insufficiency of such models in modeling the O3 formation process accurately. This study used machine learning to identify and understand the impact of various factors on O3 formation and thereby predict O3 concentrations under different climate change and emission reduction scenarios. We employed six supervised learning models to estimate O3 concentrations by using 14 meteorological and chemical variables. We found that deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models could accurately predict O3 concentrations. The variable importance analyses emphasized the significant positive contribution of solar radiation to O3; meanwhile both nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds negatively contributed to O3 concentrations. Predicted O3 concentrations based on our DNN and LSTM models in different climate change scenarios showed that increase in water vapor content could offset the effects of raised temperature, and controlling anthropogenic gases, especially carbon monoxide, might have the most bearing on controlling O3 in the future.

Among the epidemiological analyses suggesting an association between air pollution and birth weight, few have estimated the effects of black carbon (BC) or together with nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and even fewer studies have used causal modelling. Methods: We examined 1,119,011 birth records between 2001/01/01 and 2015/12/31 from the Massachusetts Birth Registry to investigate causal associations between prenatal exposure to BC and NO2 and birth weight. We calculated mean residential BC and NO2 exposures 0Â30, and 31Â280 days prior to birth from validated spatial-temporal models. We fit generalized propensity score models with gradient boosting tuned by a new algorithm to achieve covariate balance, then fit marginal structural models with stabilized inverse-probability weights. Results: Throughout pregnancy, the average birth weight would drop by 17.0 g (95% CI: 15.4, 18.6) for an IQR increase of 0.14 ?g/m3 in BC and would independently drop by 19.9 g (95% CI: 18.6, 21.3) for an IQR increase of 9.8 ppb in NO2. Most of the negative effects of BC on birth weight are from 0 to 30 days before the delivery date. The estimated odds ratio of low birth weight for every IQR increase during the entire pregnancy was 1.131 (95% CI: 1.106, 1.156) for BC and 1.082 (95% CI: 1.062, 1.103) for NO2. Conclusions: We found that prenatal exposures to both BC and NO2 were associated with lower birth weight.

We here estimated the county-specific daily maximum 8-h average ozone concentration in Jiangsu Province, China during 2015Â2018, using a recently developed spatiotemporal machine learning model at a spatial resolution of 0.1Â° Ã 0.1Â° (?11 Ã 11 km). Counties were equally divided into urban and rural groups based on the median of the percentage of urban residents across Jiangsu counties obtained from the National Population Census in 2010. We first conducted time-series analyses to estimate the county-specific effect of ozone using generalized linear models, then pooled the effect estimates by random-effects modeling. A 10 ?g/m3 increase in the 4-day moving average (lag 0Â3) of ambient ozone exposure was associated with increases of 0.66% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36%Â0.95%) in daily nonaccidental mortality in rural areas and 0.42% in urban areas (95% CI, 0.27%Â0.56%). Short-term ambient ozone exposure was associated with an increased risk of mortality caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and stroke. Our finding suggests that both urban and rural residents suffer adverse health effects from short-term ozone exposure.

Identifying interaction patterns between air cleaning and climate action represents an important step to obtain cobenefits. Here, we used a random sampling strategy through the combination of chemical transport modeling and machine learning approach to capture the interaction effects from two perspectives in which the driving forces of both climate action and air cleaning measures were compared. We revealed that climate action where carbon emissions were decreased to 1.9 Bt (billion tons) could lead to a PM2.5level of 12.4 ?g/m3(95% CI (confidence interval): 10.2-14.6 ?g/m3) in 2060, while air cleaning could force carbon emissions to reach 1.93 Bt (95% CI: 0.79-3.19 Bt) to achieve net carbon neutrality based on the potential carbon sinks in 2060. Additional controls targeting primary PM2.5, ammonia, and volatile organic compounds were required as supplements to overcome the partial lack of climate action. Our study provides novel insights into the cobenefits of air-quality improvement and climate change mitigation, indicating that the effect of air cleaning on the simultaneous goals might have been underestimated before.

Moreover, few studies to our knowledge have accounted for complex mixtures of air pollution. In this study, we evaluate the causal effects of a mixture of air pollutants on overall mortality in a large, prospective cohort of Dutch individuals. Methods: We evaluated 86,882 individuals from the LIFEWORK study, assessing overall mortality between 2013 and 2017 through national registry linkage. We predicted outdoor concentration of five air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, PM2.5absorbance, and oxidative potential) with land-use regression. We used logistic regression and mixture modeling (weighted quantile sum and boosted regression tree models) to identify potential confounders, assess pollutants' relevance in the mixture-outcome association, and investigate interactions and nonlinearities. Based on these results, we built a multivariate generalized propensity score model to estimate the causal effects of pollutant mixtures. Results: Regression model results were influenced by multicollinearity. Weighted quantile sum and boosted regression tree models indicated that all components contributed to a positive linear association with the outcome, with PM2.5being the most relevant contributor. In the multivariate propensity score model, PM2.5(OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29) and PM10(OR=1.02, 95% CI: 0.91-1.14) were associated with increased odds of mortality per interquartile range increase. Conclusion: Using novel methods for causal inference and mixture modeling in a large prospective cohort, this study strengthened the causal interpretation of air pollution effects on overall mortality, emphasizing the primary role of PM2.5within the pollutant mixture.

Efforts that have targeted roadside pollution still do not accurately monitor deadly pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Reports on regional highways across the country are based on a limited number of fixed monitoring stations that are sometimes located far from the highway. These periodic and coarse-grained measurements cause inefficient highway air quality reporting, leading to inaccurate air quality forecasts. This paper, therefore, proposes and validates a scalable deep learning framework for efficiently capturing fine-grained highway data and forecasting future concentration levels. Highways in four different UK regions - Newport, Lewisham, Southwark, and Chepstow were used as case studies to develop a REVIS system and validate the proposed framework. REVIS examined the framework's ability to capture granular pollution data, scale up its storage facility to rapid data growth and translate high-level user queries to structured query language (SQL) required for exploratory data analysis. Finally, the framework's suitability for predictive analytics was tested using fastai's library for tabular data, and automated hyperparameter tuning was implemented using bayesian optimisation. The results of our experiments demonstrate the suitability of the proposed framework in building end-to-end systems for extensive monitoring and forecasting of pollutant concentration levels on highways. The study serves as a background for future related research looking to improve the overall performance of roadside and highway air quality forecasting models.

According to air pollution and the meteorological monitoring data from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017 in Ningxia, we analyzed the impact of ground surface temperature, air temperature, relative humidity and the power of wind on air pollutant concentrations. Meanwhile, we analyze the relationships between air pollutant concentrations and meteorological variables by using the mathematical model of decision tree regressor (DTR), feedforward artificial neural network with back-propagation algorithm (FFANN-BP) and random forest regressor (RFR) according to air-monitoring station data. For all pollutants, the RFR increases R2 of FFANN-BP and DTR by up to 0.53 and 0.42 respectively, reduces root mean square error (RMSE) by up to 68.7 and 41.2, and MAE by up to 25.2 and 17. The empirical results show that the proposed RFR displays the best forecasting performance and could provide local authorities with reliable and precise predictions of air pollutant concentrations. The RFR effectively establishes the relationships between the influential factors and air pollutant concentrations, and well suppresses the overfitting problem and improves the accuracy of prediction. Besides, the limitation of machine learning for single site prediction is also overcame. Â© 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on O3, NO2, and PM10 in Makkah was analysed using air quality and meteorology data from five sites. Two approaches were employed: (a) comparing raw measured concentrations for the lockdown period in 2019 and 2020; and (b) comparing weather-corrected concentrations estimated by the machine learning approach with observed concentrations during the lockdown period. According to the first approach, the average levels of PM10 and NO2 decreased by 12% and 58.66%, respectively, whereas the levels of O3 increased by 68.67%. According to the second approach, O3 levels increased by 21.96%, while the levels of NO2 and PM10 decreased by 13.40% and 9.66%, respectively. The machine learning approach after removing the effect of changes in weather conditions demonstrated relatively less reductions in the levels of NO2 and PM10 and a smaller increase in the levels of O3. This showed the importance of adjusting air pollutant levels for meteorological conditions. O3 levels increased due to its inverse correlation with NO2, which decreased during the lockdown period.

Because climatic and air-pollution factors are known to influence the occurrence of respiratory diseases, we used these factors to develop machine learning models for predicting the occurrence of respiratory diseases. Methods. We obtained the daily number of respiratory disease patients in Seoul.We used climatic and air-pollution factors to predict the daily number of patients treated for respiratory diseases per 10,000 inhabitants.We applied the relief-based feature selection algorithm to evaluate the importance of feature selection.We used the gradient boosting and Gaussian process regression (GPR) methods, respectively, to develop two different prediction models. We also employed the holdout cross-validation method, in which 75% of the data was used to train the model, and the remaining 25% was used to test the trained model.We determined the estimated number of respiratory disease patients by applying the developed prediction models to the test set. To evaluate the performance of each model, we calculated the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the original and estimated numbers of respiratory disease patients. We used the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach to interpret the estimated output of each machine learning model. Results. Features with negative weights in the relief-based algorithm were excluded. When applying gradient boosting to unseen test data, R2 and RMSE were 0.68 and 13.8, respectively. For GPR, the R2 and RMSE were 0.67 and 13.9, respectively. SHAP analysis showed that reductions in average temperature, daylight duration, average humidity, sulfur dioxide (SO2), total solar insolation amount, and temperature difference increased the number of respiratory disease patients, whereas increases in atmospheric pressure, carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter ?2.5 Âµm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) increased the number of respiratory disease patients. Conclusion. We successfully developed models for predicting the occurrence of respiratory diseases using climatic and air-pollution factors.These models could evolve into public warning systems.

Two parameters fog fraction and widespread fog days (WFDs) are estimated in this study by functional mapping of fog observations with 8 atmospheric parameters for the period 1981Â2018 using three empirical/machine learning approaches. Of these, we note that the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) exhibits superiority in performance by showing the mapping closer to the observed, and also offers promising potential for operational purposes to provide fog outlooks for the IGP region. Temporal evolution of fog fractions and WFDs is analyzed from the CMIP6 projections following the aforementioned four future scenarios using CNN for the future periods of the twenty-first century. It is noted that there is a substantial enhancement in the CMIP6 projected fog fractions as high as 57% during the period (2015Â2045) relative to the historical (1981Â2014) period, while the largest increase of 154% is seen in projected WFDs. It is also seen that the near-future period (2015Â2045) witnesses a larger prevalence of WFDs, for all scenarios except SSP126, due to the combined effects of air pollution and greenhouse warming. The post-2046 periods, however, generally indicate signatures of decline in foggy days with widespread conditions relative to historical period in most of the scenarios except SSP370. The severity in fog conditions following the high-emission scenarios SSP370 and SSP585 during this period comes from the relative impact of mitigation strategies of pollutants. The findings provide insights into the possible future changes in widespread fog conditions suitable for the IGP region.

This, in turn, requires powerful tools for air quality modeling. In this article we develop a two-stage procedure for predicting exceedances of the EU legal limits for PM10 and O (Formula presented.) concentrations using hourly data. Within the first stage we deploy machine learning methods to produce accurate 24-h-ahead forecasts of hourly pollutant concentrations at seven specific locations in the cities of Augsburg and Munich, Germany. The best performance was shown by the Stochastic Gradient Boosting ModelÂan ensemble tree-based method, especially convenient because of its computational efficiency and robustness to overfitting. Its predictive ability was largely superior to that reported by similar studies. In the second stage, the hourly forecasts were used to predict the exceedances of the EU daily limits for PM10 and O (Formula presented.) concentrations. For both pollutants we could achieve the average probability of exceedances detection above 80%, while keeping the probability of false alarms at a reasonably low level. Such satisfactory results show that our approach can be successfully applied to anticipate the shocks, which would allow authorities to manage them in the most effective manner.

For example, a CTM-based operational forecasting system for air quality over the Pacific Northwest, called AIRPACT, uses over 100 processors for several hours to provide 48-h forecasts daily, but struggles to capture unhealthy O3 episodes during the summer and early fall, especially over Kennewick, WA. This research developed machine learning (ML) based O3 forecasts for Kennewick, WA to demonstrate an improved forecast capability. We used the 2017Â2020 simulated meteorology and O3 observation data from Kennewick as training datasets. The meteorology datasets are from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) meteorological model forecasts produced daily by the University of Washington. Our ozone forecasting system consists of two ML models, ML1 and ML2, to improve predictability: ML1 uses the random forest (RF) classifier and multiple linear regression (MLR) models, and ML2 uses a two-phase RF regression model with best-fit weighting factors. To avoid overfitting, we evaluate the ML forecasting system with the 10-time, 10-fold, and walk-forward cross-validation analysis. Compared to AIRPACT, ML1 improved forecast skill for high-O3 events and captured 5 out of 10 unhealthy O3 events, while AIRPACT and ML2 missed all the unhealthy events. ML2 showed better forecast skill for less elevated-O3 events. Based on this result, we set up our ML modeling framework to use ML1 for high-O3 events and ML2 for less elevated O3 events. Since May 2019, the ML modeling framework has been used to produce daily 72-h O3 forecasts and has provided forecasts via the web for clean air agency and public use: http://ozonematters.com/. Compared to the testing period, the operational forecasting period has not had unhealthy O3 events. Nevertheless, the ML modeling framework demonstrated a reliable forecasting capability at a selected location with much less computational resources. The ML system uses a single processor for minutes compared to the CTM-based forecasting system using more than 100 processors for hours.

The current understanding of the factors which govern non-linear behavior of B[a]P and associated pollutants and environmental processes is insufficient and further research has to rely on the advanced analytical approach which averts the assumptions and avoids simplifications required by linear modeling methods.

Objective: We constructed an ensemble machine learning model to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations for regions lack of PM2.5 observations. Methods: The model was constructed based on daily PM2.5, visibility, and other meteorological data collected at two sites in Kuwait. Then, our model was applied to predict the daily level of PM2.5 concentrations for eight airports located in Kuwait and Iraq from 2013 to 2020. Results: As compared to traditional statistic models, the proposed machine learning methods improved the accuracy in using visibility to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations with a cross-validation R2 of 0.68. The predicted level of daily PM2.5 concentrations were consistent with previous measurements. The predicted average yearly PM2.5 concentration for the eight stations is 50.65 Âµg/m3. For all stations, the monthly average PM2.5 concentrations reached their maximum in July and their minimum in November. Significance: These findings make it possible to retrospectively estimate daily PM2.5 exposures using the large-scale databases of historical visibility in regions with few particulate matter monitoring stations. Impact statement: The scarcity of air pollution ground monitoring networks makes it difficult to assess historical fine particulate matter exposures for countries in arid areas such as Kuwait. Visibility is closely related to atmospheric particulate matter concentrations and historical airport visibility records are commonly available in most countries. Our model make it possible to retrospectively estimate daily PM2.5 exposures using the large-scale databases of historical visibility in arid regions with few particulate matter ground monitoring stations.

This paper proposes a new cross-domain prediction model of air pollutant concentration based on federated learning (FL), differential privacy laplace mechanism (DPLA) and long and short-term memory network optimized by sparrow search algorithm (SSA-LSTM), named FL-DPLA-SSA-LSTM. Firstly, with FL, SSA-LSTM is used as local training model for each city and predicts air pollutant concentration. Secondly, DPLA is used to add noise to the local model parameters, which can protect local data security. Then, the global model is updated by using the federated averaging algorithm (FedAvg). Lastly, FL is used to share global model for all cities, which can safely and quickly cross-domain predict air pollutant concentration. For data set, it is taken from hourly air pollutants and meteorological data from 12 cities in the Fenhe River and Weihe River Plains in China in 2020. The experimental results show that the prediction performance of the proposed model is significantly better than all comparison models. FedAvg updating with local model parameters with DPLA noise has little effect on the performance of the global model and even exceeds that of the global model. The calculation time of FL-DPLA-SSA-LSTM model is reduced by 99.95% compared with that of not using FL-DPLA machine learning model. It is proved that the model is high sharing and high safety, which greatly improves the training efficiency and has better generalization ability. It is significant for joint air pollution prevention and control and environmental protection.

The applied method is to strict measures and to better manage particulate matter pollution in Ras Garib city, Egypt as a case study. Air pollution data for the period between 2018 and 2021 is collected using five air quality stations.

With the world rapid industrialization, this pollution in tea is considered a crucial challenge due to its potential health risks. The present study proposes an innovative approach based on visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics for the characterization of tea chemical indicators under airborne lead stress, which can be performed fast and in situ. The effects of lead stress on chemical indicators and accumulation in leaves of the two tea varieties at different time intervals and levels of treatment were investigated. In addition, changes in cell structure and leaf stomata were monitored during foliar uptake of aerosol particles by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The spectral variation was able to classify the tea samples into the Pb treatment groups through the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model. Two machine learning techniques, namely, partial least squares (PLS) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), were evaluated and compared for building the quantitative determination models. The RBFNN models combined with correlation-based feature selection (CFS) and PLS data compression methods were used to optimize the prediction performance. The results demonstrated that the PLSÂRBFNN as a non-linear model outperformed the PLS model and provided the R-value of 0.944, 0.952, 0.881, 0.937, and 0.930 for prediction of MDA, starch, sucrose, fructose, glucose, respectively.

Fine Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 is the most significant ecological jeopardy feature contributing to global Cardio Vascular (CV) transience and respiratory syndrome. In India, the majority metropolitan spot has a deprived air quality with PM 2.5 levels exceeding the suggested limits. Apparently 60 % of Indian metropolitan areas has PM 2.5 levels greater than the index suggested by National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Hence, it is important to examine the level of PM 2.5 in air. In this paper, PM 2.5 level is monitored at various time stamp through Deep Learning (DL) technique called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) which is a modification of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The proposed model will assist in alerting the dangerous level of PM 2.5 and taking action against it. Here, we use a 5 G protocol named 5 G Narrow Bands-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) communication protocol to alert officials quickly about the dangerous level of PM 2.5. This proposed techniques also helps to monitor the levels of various gaseous such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulphur di Oxide (SO2), Oxide (O3), Hydrogen di Sulphide (H2S), Nitrogen di Oxide (NO2) along with Particulate Matter (PM 2.5). The proposed technology develops a cost effective and accurate stack based air pollution module that will provide a real-time, location based air pollutant statistics. The data is considered in division of one hour with different air quality sensors. The performance is measured using the loss function and the accuracy of predicting the PM 2.5 level.

Due to its strict correlation with human presence, carbon dioxide (CO2) represents one of the pollutants that most affects environmental health. Therefore, forecasting future indoor CO2 plays a central role in taking preventive measures to keep CO2 level as low as possible. Unlike other research that aims to maximize the prediction accuracy, typically using data collected over many days, in this work we propose a practical approach for predicting indoor CO2 using a limited window of recent environmental data (i.e., temperature; humidity; CO2 of, e.g., a room, office or shop) for training neural network models, without the need for any kind of model pre-training. After just a week of data collection, the error of predictions was around 15 parts per million (ppm), which should enable the system to regulate heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems accurately. After a month of data we reduced the error to about 10 ppm, thereby achieving a high prediction accuracy in a short time from the beginning of the data collection. Once the desired mobile window size is reached, the model can be continuously updated by sliding the window over time, in order to guarantee long-term performance. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Scientists and environmental organizations have been looking for new ways to combat and control the air pollution, developing new solutions as technologies evolves. In the last decade, devices able to observe and maintain pollution levels have become more accessible and less expensive, and with the appearance of the Internet of Things (IoT), new approaches for combating pollution were born. The focus of the research presented in this paper was predicting behaviours regarding the air quality index using machine learning. Data were collected from one of the six atmospheric stations set in relevant areas of Bucharest, Romania, to validate our model. Several algorithms were proposed to study the evolution of temperature depending on the level of pollution and on several pollution factors. In the end, the results generated by the algorithms are presented considering the types of pollutants for two distinct periods.

This study aimed to investigate associations between active commuting to work with cardiovascular disease (CVD), mortality and life expectancy among general Chinese adults, and to further evaluate the modification effect of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure on these associations. Methods: We included 76,176 Chinese adults without CVD from three large cohorts of the Prediction for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk in China project. Information about commuting mode and physical activity were collected by unified questionnaire. Satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations at 1-km spatial resolution was used for estimating PM2.5 exposure of participants. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CVD incidence, mortality and all-cause mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Multiplicative interaction term of commuting mode and PM2.5 level was tested to investigate potential effect modification. Results: During 448,499 person-years of follow-up, 2230 CVD events and 2777 all-cause deaths were recorded. Compared with the non-active commuters, the multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of CVD incidence and all-cause mortality were 0.95(0.85Â1.05) and 0.79(0.72Â0.87) for walking commuters, respectively. Corresponding HRs (95% CIs) for cycling commuters were 0.71(0.62Â0.82) and 0.67(0.59Â0.76). Active commuters over 45 years old were estimated to have more CVD-free years and life expectancy than non-active commuters under lower PM2.5 concentration. However, these beneficial effects of active commuting were alleviated or counteracted by long-term exposure to high PM2.5 concentration. Significant multiplicative interaction of commuting mode and PM2.5 level was showed in all-cause mortality, with the lowest risk observed in cycling participants exposed to lower level of PM2.5. Conclusions: Active commuting was associated with lower risk of CVD, all-cause mortality, and longer life expectancy among Chinese adults under ambient settings with lower PM2.5 level. It will be valuable to encourage active commuting among adults and develop stringent strategies on ambient PM2.5 pollution control for prevention of CVD and prolongation of life expectancy.

In this study, we used a common camera to automatically photograph the daytime and nighttime lights at an urban site in Beijing during 2019Â2020, to support or act as a possible alternative to radiosonde measurement. The photo features characterize the scattering effect of atmospheric particulate matter on visible sunlight or lamps and record cloud, fog, and precipitation processes. The probability distributions of the mean blue brightness (B) and the mean red brightness (R) are significantly different for both the sky-part and the ground-part pixels of the photo. The B/R ratio of the sky part (B/R_sky) is exponentially and negatively correlated with ground PM2.5 concentration. During the daytime, B/R_sky has a higher priority than the boundary layer height (BLH) in the determination of PM2.5 concentration by a decision tree model, whereas the BLH plays a key role at night, and the importance of B/R_sky is comparable to that of the BLH in the decision tree. The photo features were adopted as input variables into a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model (3-layer neural network) predicting PM2.5 concentration, with a root mean square error of 1Â3 ?g/m3, indicating that the auto-shooting camera is a competitive alternative of meteorological measurement. Because of the low cost of installation, the broad application of auto-photography can make up for deficiencies of sounding observation, i.e., sparse temporal and spatial resolution, and can be accessed by the public in real time.

One of the major effects of air pollution on health is hospitalizations associated with air pollution. Recently, the estimation and prediction of air pollutionÂbased hospitalization is carried out using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, i.e., deep learning and long short-term memory (LSTM). However, there is ample room for improvement in the available applied methodologies to estimate and predict air pollutionÂbased hospital admissions. In this paper, we present the modeling and analysis of air pollution and cardiorespiratory hospitalization. This study aims to investigate the association between cardiorespiratory hospitalization and air pollution, and predict cardiorespiratory hospitalization based on air pollution using the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. We propose the enhanced long short-term memory (ELSTM) model and provide a comparison with other AI techniques, i.e., LSTM, DL, and vector autoregressive (VAR). This study was conducted at seven study locations in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The utilized dataset contains the data from January 2006 to December 2016 for five study locations, i.e., Klang (KLN), Shah Alam (SA), Putrajaya (PUJ), Petaling Jaya (PJ), and Cheras, Kuala Lumpur (CKL). The dataset for Banting contains data from April 2010 to December 2016, and the data for Batu Muda, Kuala Lumpur, contains data from January 2009 to December 2016. The prediction results show that the ELSTM model performed significantly better than other models in all study locations, with the best RMSE scores in Klang study location (ELSTM: 0.002, LSTM: 0.013, DL: 0.006, VAR: 0.066). The results also indicated that the proposed ELSTM model was able to detect and predict the trends of monthly hospitalization significantly better than the LSTM and other models in the study. Hence, we can conclude that we can utilize AI techniques to accurately predict cardiorespiratory hospitalization based on air pollution in Klang Valley, Malaysia.

Fast and effective explanation of the air quality is a necessary technique for monitoring the air pollution. However, the existing air quality measurement devices severely rely on many sensors, which are not only expensive but also inconvenient to carry. With the development of deep learning technology, computer vision-based task, such as the video processing and understanding have achieved great progress. Recently, image-based air quality measuring methods have been proposed and achieved satisfying accuracy in specific scenes. Whereas, the performance of those methods are not stable due to the noises in images and missed temporal relations between single images. With the rising of the short-video platform, the acquisition and dissemination of video data becomes more convenient. To address the problems of image-based air pollution measurement, we propose a video-based dual-channel 3-D convolution network for stable and accurate measuring. Besides the basic visual channel, we add a semantic channel to guide the network learn region-level features. The features from two channels are combined for stable prediction. Moreover, to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we collect an outdoor video data set for air quality measurement through smart phones. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves good results in the air quality measurement and outperforms the image-based methods.

In South Africa, however, availability of continuous ground-level air pollution monitoring data is scarce and incomplete. To address this issue, we developed and compared different modeling approaches to impute missing daily average particulate matter (PM10) data between 2010 and 2017 using spatiotemporal predictor variables. The random forest (RF) machine learning method was used to explore the relationship between average daily PM10 concentrations and spatiotemporal predictors like meteorological, land use and source-related variables. National (8 models), provincial (32) and site-specific (44) RF models were developed to impute missing daily PM10 data. The annual national, provincial and sitespecific RF cross-validation (CV) models explained on average 78%, 70% and 55% of ground-level PM10 concentrations, respectively. The spatial components of the national and provincial CV RF models explained on average 22% and 48%, while the temporal components of the national, provincial and site-specific CV RF models explained on average 78%, 68% and 57% of ground-level PM10 concentrations, respectively.

Studies have typically relied on relatively sparse environmental monitoring data that lack the spatial resolution to assess small-area improvements in air quality and health. Few studies have integrated multiple types of measures of an air pollutant into one single modeling framework that combines spatially- and temporally-rich monitoring data. In this paper, we investigated the differential effects of California emissions reduction plan on reducing air pollution between those living in the goods movement corridors (GMC) that are within 500 m of major highways that serve as truck routes to those farther away or adjacent to routes that prohibit trucks. A mixed effects Deletion/Substitution/Addition (D/S/A) machine learning algorithm was developed to model annual pollutant concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by taking repeated measures into consideration and by integrating multiple types of NO2 measurements, including those through government regulatory and research-oriented saturation monitoring into a single modeling framework. Difference-in-difference analysis was conducted to identify whether those living in GMC demonstrated statistically larger reductions in air pollution exposure. The mixed effects D/S/A machine learning modeling result indicated that GMC had 2 ppb greater reductions in NO2 concentrations from pre- to post-policy period than far away areas. The difference-in-difference analysis demonstrated that the subjects living in GMC experienced statistically significant greater reductions in NO2 exposure than those living in the far away areas. This study contributes to scientific knowledge by providing empirical evidence that improvements in air quality via the emissions reductions plan policies impacted traffic-related air pollutant concentrations and associated exposures most among low-income Californians with chronic conditions living in GMC. The identified differences in pollutant reductions across different location domains may be applicable to other states or other countries if similar policies are enacted.

PM2.5 is one of the main components of air pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to know the PM2.5 air quality in advance for health. Many studies on air quality are based on the governmentÂs official air quality monitoring stations, which cannot be widely deployed due to high cost constraints. Furthermore, the update frequency of government monitoring stations is once an hour, and it is hard to capture short-term PM2.5 concentration peaks with little warning. Nevertheless, dealing with short-term data with many stations, the volume of data is huge and is calculated, analyzed and predicted in a complex way. This alleviates the high computational requirements of the original predictor, thus making Spark suitable for the considered problem. This study proposes a PM2.5 instant prediction architecture based on the Spark big data framework to handle the huge data from the LASS community. The Spark big data framework proposed in this study is divided into three modules. It collects real time PM2.5 data and performs ensemble learning through three machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) to predict the PM2.5 concentration value in the next 30 to 180 min with accompanying visualization graph. The experimental results show that our proposed Spark big data ensemble prediction model in next 30-min prediction has the best performance (R2 up to 0.96), and the ensemble model has better performance than any single machine learning model. Taiwan has been suffering from a situation of relatively poor air pollution quality for a long time. Air pollutant monitoring data from LASS community can provide a wide broader monitoring, however the data is large and difficult to integrate or analyze. The proposed Spark big data framework system can provide short-term PM2.5 forecasts and help the decision-maker to take proper action immediately. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Some air pollutants exhibit similar behavior in the atmosphere, and some interact with each other; thus, comprehensive assessments of individual air pollutants are required. In this study, we developed national-scale monthly models for six air pollutants (NO, NO2, SO2, O3, PM2.5, and suspended particulate matter (SPM)) to obtain accurate estimates of pollutant concentrations at 1 km Ã 1 km resolution from 2010 through 2015 for application to the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS), which is a large-scale birth cohort study. We developed our models in the land use regression framework using random forests in conjunction with kriging. We evaluated the model performance via 5-fold location-based cross-validation. We successfully predicted monthly NO (r2 = 0.65), NO2 (r2 = 0.84), O3 (r2 = 0.86), PM2.5 (r2 = 0.79), and SPM (r2 = 0.64) concentrations. For SO2, a satisfactory model could not be developed (r2 = 0.45) because of the low SO2 concentrations in Japan. The performance of our models is comparable to those reported in previous studies at similar temporal and spatial scales. The model predictions in conjunction with the JECS will reveal the critical windows of prenatal and infancy exposure to ambient air pollutants, thus contributing to the development of environmental policies on air pollution.

We also predicted PM2.5 concentrations for each administrative area (khoroo) of the city using RF and maps of predictions show spatiotemporal variations that are in line with the location of the high-emission area (ger district), city center, and population density. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence of the advantage and feasibility of machine learning approaches in predicting ambient PM2.5 levels in a setting with limited resources and extreme air pollution levels.

However, these risk factors have experienced dramatic changes in the BeijingÂTianjinÂHebei (BTH) region in recent years, and few cohorts have focused on identifying risk factors for major NCDs in this specific region. The current study is a large, prospective, long-term, population-based cohort study that investigated environmental and genetic determinants of NCDs in BTH areas. The results of this study may provide scientific support for efforts to develop health recommendations for personalized prevention. Methods: About 36,000 participants 18 years or older would be obtained by multistage, stratified cluster sampling from five cities for the baseline assessment. Participants underwent seven examinations primarily targeting respiratory and circulatory system function and filled out questionnaires regarding lifestyle behavior, pollutant exposure, medical and family history, medication history, and psychological factors. Biochemistry indicators and inflammation markers were tested, and a biobank was established. Participants will be followed up every 2 years. Genetic determinants of NCDs will be demonstrated by using multiomics, and risk prediction models will be constructed using machine learning methods based on a multitude of environmental exposure, examination data, biomarkers, and psychosocial and behavioral assessments. Significant spatial and temporal differentiation is well-suited to demonstrating the health determinants of NCDs in the BTH region, which may facilitate public health strategies with respect to disease prevention and survivorship-related aspects.

Existing spatiotemporal interpolation algorithms are usually based on the assumption that interpolation models follow explicit and simple mathematical descriptions. Unfortunately, the real world does not really follow these perfect mathematical models. Combining data fusion techniques and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), we present a novel spatiotemporal interpolation model, which is able to achieve high estimation accuracies over a long time period and a large area. By fusing the daily PM2.5 data, meteorological data, elevation data, and land-use data collected from China in 2016, four experiments were conducted in this study to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results showed that applying LSTM RNN on the fused dataset can achieve consistent and high accuracy in different geographies.

The model uses a fusion machine learning model based on multisource data, including air pollutants, meteorological observations, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, and an operational regional atmospheric environmental modeling System for eastern China (RAEMS) outputs. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and a numerical prediction method, i.e., RAEMS were fused to establish this prediction model. Three sets of prediction models, that is, BFM, LightGBM based on multisource data (LGBM), and RAEMS, were used to conduct visibility prediction tasks. The training set was from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2018 and used several data pre-processing methods, including a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) data resampling, a loss function adjustment, and a 10-fold cross verification. Moreover, apart from the basic features (variables), more spatial and temporal gradient features were considered. The testing set was from 1 January to 31 December 2019 and was adopted to validate the feasibility of the BFM, LGBM, and RAEMS. Statistical indicators confirmed that the machine learning methods improved the RAEMS forecast significantly and consistently. The root mean square error and correlation coefficient of BFM for the next 24/48 h were 5.01/5.47 km and 0.80/0.77, respectively, which were much higher than those of RAEMS. The statistics and binary score analysis for different areas in Shanghai also proved the reliability and accuracy of using BFM, particularly in low-visibility forecasting. Overall, BFM is a suitable tool for predicting the visibility. It provides a more accurate visibility forecast for the next 24 and 48 h in Shanghai than LGBM and RAEMS. The results of this study provide support for real-time operational visibility forecasts. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Users can pickup and drop-off bicycles at any station, and thus inventory imbalances can occur. To improve system efficiency, system operators should establish appropriate repositioning strategies based on accurate predictions of demand for bicycles. This study aims to predict station-level demand for pickup and drop-off of bicycles using station activity information. In addition to time and weather information, the number of pickups and drop-offs at a station 1-3 h before the prediction was used as a predictor. A random forest machine learning technique is adopted for the demand prediction. The PBS database in Seoul, South Korea was used for the case study. To compare prediction accuracy by station usage patterns, the stations are classified into four clusters. The analysis results show that prediction accuracy including lag information provides mprovements of up to 20%, and the forecast for drop-off is more accurate than the forecast for pickup. This study practically contributes to increasing operational efficiency and reducing operating costs by improving demand predictability in a PBS system.

To this end, this paper proposes the long-short term memory network (LSTM) algorithm based on spatiotemporal fusion. First, the spatial correlation, the relevant factors and the calculation methods are proposed; then, the local spatial correlation factors are combined with the forget gate and the remember gate of the LSTM algorithm to construct a LSTM algorithm based on local spatial information and spatial-temporal correlation, namely the LTS-LSTM; after that, the learning result of LTS-LSTM is combined with the global spatial correlation factors to construct a LSTM algorithm based on global spatial information and spatial-temporal correlation, namely the GTS-LSTM; at last, the proposed algorithm is adopted to simulate the global and local air pollution particle concentration evolution process, and predict the particle concentration. On the global and local observation dataset, the proposed algorithm is compared with the regression algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), fuzzy neural network (FNN), LSTM neural network, GC-LSTM neural network, and DL-LSTM neural network.

We built linear regression and random forest regression models using 4-years (2015Â2018; hourly-averaged) observations for forecasting O3, NO and NO2 levels for two scenarios (1-month prediction (for January 2019) and 1-year prediction (for 2019)) Â with and without the impact of meteorology. These flexible models have been developed for, both, localised (site-specific models) and combined (indicative of city-level) cases. Both models were aided with machine learning, to reduce their time-intensity compared to models built over high-performance computing. O3 prediction performance of linear regression model at the city level, under both cases of meteorological consideration, was found to be significantly poor. However, the site-specific model with meteorology performed satisfactorily (r = 0.87; RK Puram site). Further, during testing, linear regression models (site-specific and combined) for NO and NO2 with meteorology, show a slight improvement in their prediction accuracies when compared to the corresponding equivalent linear models without meteorology. Random forest regression with meteorology performed satisfactorily for indicative city-level NO (r = 0.90), NO2 (r = 0.89) and O3 (r = 0.85). In both regression techniques, increased uncertainty in modelling O3 is attributed to it being a secondary pollutant, non-linear dependency on NOx, VOCs, CO, radicals, and micro-climatic meteorological parameters. Analysis of importance among various precursors and meteorology have also been computed. The study holistically concludes that site-specific models with meteorology perform satisfactorily for both linear regression and random forest regression.

Particulate matter (PM) is one of the most important air pollutants in the atmosphere, and it can be released into the atmosphere by natural and anthropogenic processes or can be formed in the atmosphere as a result of chemical reactions. In this study, it was aimed to predict PM10 and PM2.5 components measured in an industrial zone selected by adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), classification and regression trees (CART), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) methods.

Therefore, the European Commission formulated directives to regulate O3 concentrations in near-surface air. However, almost 50% of the 5068 air quality stations in Europe do not monitor O3 concentrations. This study aims to provide a hybrid modeling system that fills these gaps in the hourly surface O3 observations on a site scale with much higher accuracy than existing O3 models. This hybrid model was developed using estimations from multiple linear regression-based eXtreme Gradient Boosting Machines (MLR-XGBM) and O3 reanalysis from European regional air quality models (CAMS-EU). The binary classification of extremely high O3 events and the 1- and 24-h forecasts of hourly O3 were investigated as secondary aims. In this study thirteen stations in Northern Bavaria, out of which six do not monitor O3, were chosen as test sites. Considering the computational complexity of machine learning algorithms (MLAs), we also applied two recent MLA interpretation methods, namely SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). With SHAP, we showed an increasing effect of temperature on O3 concentrations which intensifies for temperatures exceeding 17 Â°C. According to LIME, O3 concentration peaks are mainly governed by meteorological factors under dry and warm conditions on a regional scale, whereas local nitrogen oxide concentrations control base O3 concentrations during cold and wet periods. While recently developed MLAs for the spatial estimation of hourly O3 concentrations had a station-based root-mean-square error (RMSE) above 27 ?g/m3, our proposed model significantly reduced the estimation errors by about 66% with an RMSE of 9.49 ?g/m3. We also found that logistic regression (LR) and MLR-XGBM performed best in the site-scale classification and 24-h forecast of O3 concentrations (with a station-averaged accuracy and RMSE of 0.95 and 19.34 ?g/m3, respectively).

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between specific PM2.5 metal components and QT interval length. Methods: We measured heart-rate corrected QT interval (QTc) duration among 630 participants in the Normative Aging Study (NAS) based in Eastern Massachusetts between 2000 and 2011. We utilized time-varying linear mixed-effects regressions with a random intercept for each participant to analyze associations between QTc interval and moving averages (0Â7 day moving averages) of 24-h mean concentrations of PM2.5 metal components (vanadium, nickel, copper, zinc and lead) measured at the Harvard Supersite monitoring station. Models were adjusted for daily PM2.5 mass estimated at a 1 km Ã 1 km grid cell from a previously validated prediction model and other covariates. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was utilized to assess the overall joint effect of the PM2.5 metal components. Results: We found consistent results with higher lead (Pb) associated with significant higher QTc intervals for both the multi-pollutant and the two pollutant (PM2.5 mass and a PM2.5 component) models across the moving averages. The greatest effect of lead on QTc interval was detected for the 4-day moving average lead exposure. In the multi-pollutant model, each 2.72 ng/m3 increase in daily lead levels for a 4-day moving average was associated with a 7.91 ms (95% CI: 3.63, 12.18) increase in QTc interval. In the two-pollutant models with PM2.5 mass and lead, each 2.72 ng/m3 increase in daily lead levels for a 4-day moving average was associated with an 8.50 ms (95% CI: 4.59, 12.41) increase in QTc interval. We found that 4-day moving average of copper has a negative association with QTc interval when compared to the other PM2.5 metal components. In the multi-pollutant model, each 1.81 ng/m3 increase in daily copper levels for a 4-day moving average was associated with an ?3.89 ms (95% CI: -6.98, ?0.79) increase in QTc interval. Copper's essential function inside the human body could mediate its cardiotoxicity on cardiac conductivity and explain why we found that copper in comparison to the other metals was less harmful for QTc interval. Conclusions: Exposure to metals contained in PM2.5 are associated with acute changes in ventricular repolarization as indicated by QT interval characteristics.

Firstly, individual Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were applied to predict the day of the year (DOY) when the peak of the pollen season occurs, resulting the estimated average peak date 149.1 Â± 9.3 and 150.1 Â± 10.8 DOY for LightGBM and ANN, respectively, close to the observed value (148.8 Â± 9.8). Secondly, the daily pollen concentrations during the entire pollen season have been calculated using an ensemble of two-step GAM followed by LightGBM and ANN. The results of the prediction of daily pollen concentrations showed a coefficient of determination (r2) above 0.75 (goodness of the model following cross-validation). The predictors included in the ensemble models were meteorological variables, phenological metrics, specific site-characteristics, and preceding pollen concentrations. The models are state-of-the-art in machine learning and their potential has been shown to be used and deployed to understand and to predict the pollen risk levels during the main olive pollen season.

Air quality level is determined by measures of several air pollutant concentrations. To create awareness among people, an automation system that forecasts the quality is needed. The COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions it has imposed on anthropogenic activities have resulted in a drop in air pollution in various cities in India. The overall air quality index (AQI) at any particular time is given as the maximum band for any pollutant. PM2.5 is a fine particulate matter of a size less than 2.5 micrometers, the inhalation of which causes adverse effects in people suffering from acute respiratory syndrome and other cardiovascular diseases. PM2.5 is a crucial factor in deciding the overall AQI. The proposed forecasting model is designed to predict the annual PM2.5 and AQI. The forecasting models are designed using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and FacebookÂs Prophet Library through optimal hyperparameters for better prediction. An AQI category classification model is also presented using classical machine learning techniques. The experimental results confirm the substantial improvement in air quality and greater reduction in PM2.5 due to the lockdown imposed during the COVID-19 crisis. Â© 2021 Tech Science Press.

To this end, numerous methods for time-series forecasting and deep-learning approaches based on neural networks have been used. However, they usually rely on a certain model with a stationary condition, and there are few studies of real-time prediction of dynamic massive multivariate data. Use of a variety of independent variables included in the data is important to improve forecasting performance. In this paper, we proposed a real-time prediction approach based on an ensemble method for multivariate time-series data. The suggested method can select multivariate time-series variables and incorporate real-time updatable autoregressive models in terms of performance. We verified the proposed model using simulated data and applied it to predict air quality measured by five sensors and failures based on real-time performance log data in server systems. We found that the proposed method for air pollution prediction showed effective and stable performance for both short-and long-term prediction tasks. In addition, traditional methods for abnormality detection have focused on present status of objects as either normal or abnormal based on provided data, we protectively predict expected statuses of objects with provided real-time data and implement effective system management in cloud environments through the proposed method.

BART is constructed under a probabilistic framework that also allows for model-based prediction uncertainty quantification. We evaluated the application of BART in predicting daily concentrations of four fine particulate matter (PM2.5) components (elemental carbon, organic carbon, nitrate, and sulfate) in California during the period 2005 to 2014. We demonstrate in this paper how BART can be tuned to optimize prediction performance and how to evaluate variable importance. Our BART models included, as predictors, a large suite of land-use variables, meteorological conditions, satellite-derived aerosol optical depth parameters, and simulations from a chemical transport model. In cross-validation experiments, BART demonstrated good out-of-sample prediction performance at monitoring locations (R2 from 0.62 to 0.73). More importantly, prediction intervals associated with concentration estimates from BART showed good coverage probability at locations with and without monitoring data. In our case study, major PM2.5 components could be estimated with good accuracy, especially when collocated PM2.5 total mass observations were available. In conclusion, BART is an attractive approach for modeling ambient air pollution levels, especially for its ability to provide uncertainty in estimates that may be useful for subsequent health impact and health effect analyses.

We investigated the use of available remote-sensing aerosol optical depth (AOD) data to develop spatially and temporally resolved models to predict daily particulate matter (PM10) concentrations across four provinces of South Africa (Gauteng, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape) for the year 2016 in a two-staged approach. In stage 1, a Random Forest (RF) model was used to impute Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction AOD data for days where it was missing. In stage 2, the machine learner algorithms RF, Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression were used to model the relationship between ground-monitored PM10 data, AOD and other spatial and temporal predictors. These were subsequently combined in an ensemble model to predict daily PM10 concentrations at 1 km Ã 1 km spatial resolution across the four provinces. An out-of-bag R2 of 0.96 was achieved for the first stage model. The stage 2 cross-validated (CV) ensemble model captured 0.84 variability in ground-monitored PM10 with a spatial CV R2 of 0.48 and temporal CV R2 of 0.80. The stage 2 model indicated an optimal performance of the daily predictions when aggregated to monthly and annual means. Our results suggest that a combination of remote sensing data, chemical transport model estimates and other spatiotemporal predictors has the potential to improve air quality exposure data in South Africa's major industrial provinces.

Based on real-world data consisting of instantaneous fuel consumption, time-varying speeds observations, and high-frequency traffic, we propose effective methods to estimate fuel consumption. By carrying out nonlinear regression analysis using supervised learning methods, namely Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Conditional Inference Trees, and Gradient Boosting Machines, we develop new models that provide better prediction accuracy than classical models. We correctly estimate consumption for time-dependent point-to-point routing under realistic conditions. Our methods provide a more precise alternative to classical regression methods used in the literature, as they are developed for a specific situation. Extensive computational experiments under realistic conditions show the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning consumption models, clearly outperforming macroscopic and microscopic consumption models such as the Comprehensive Modal Emissions Model (CMEM) and the Methodology for Estimating air pollutant Emissions from Transport (MEET). Based on sensitivity analyses we show that MEET underestimates real-world consumption by 24.94% and CMEM leads to an overestimation of consumption by 7.57% with optimised parameters.

One of the leading sources of climate change is automobiles. Automobiles are the prime source of air pollution in urban areas globally. This has resulted in a problematic and chaotic state in the development of an automatic traffic management system for capturing and monitoring vehiclesÂ hourly and daily passage. With the significant advancement of sensor technology, atmospheric information such as air pollution, meteorological, and motor vehicle data can be harvested and stored in databases. However, due to the complexity and non-linear associations between air quality, meteorological, and traffic variables, it is difficult for the traditional statistical and mathematical models to analyze them. Recently, machine learning algorithms in the field of traffic emissions prediction have become a popular tool. Meteorological and traffic variables influence the variation and the trend of the traffic pollutants. In this paper, an optimized artificial neural network (OANN) was developed to enhance the existing artificial neural network (ANN) model by updating the initial weights in the network using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The OANN model was implemented to predict the concentration of CO, NO, NO2, and NOx pollutants produced by motor vehicles in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. OANN was compared with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) models. The results show that the developed OANN model performed better than the ANN, RF, and DT models with the lowest MSE values of 0.0247 for CO, 0.0365 for NO, 0.0542 NO2, and 0.1128 for NOX. It can be concluded that the developed OANN model is a better choice in predicting traffic emission concentrations. The developed OANN model can help environmental agencies monitor traffic-related air pollution levels efficiently and take necessary measures to ensure the effectiveness of traffic management policy. The OANN model can also help decision-makers mitigate traffic emissions to protect citizens living in the neighborhood of highways. Â© 2021.

Therefore, accurately measuring and predicting air pollution has been an important societal issue. With the era of big data and the development of artificial intelligence technologies, air pollution concentration is now being measured and recorded in real-time using different sensors. Studies have attempted to predict air pollution concentration using deep learning-based spatiotemporal prediction. This, in turn, is based on distance networks. In these studies, the distance network used to predict air pollution simply reflects the distance. However, since air pollutants cannot move over high mountain ranges and move according to the wind, the station network should include the effect of terrain and the wind direction. Previous studies do not consider these effects. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel station network that combines distance and causality networks based on transfer entropy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, out-of-sample experiments with an hourly dataset are performed from January 2017 to October 2020 using information from 186 stations in the Republic of Korea.

In this work, a complete modeling framework to estimate road traffic microscopic pollutant emissions from common macroscopic road and traffic information is proposed. A machine learning model to estimate driving behavior as a function of traffic conditions and road infrastructure is coupled with a physics-based microscopic emissions model. The up-scaling of the individual vehicle emissions to the traffic-level contribution is simply performed via a meta-model using both statistical vehicles fleet composition and traffic volume data. Validation results with real-world driving data show that: the driving behavior model is able to maintain an estimation error below 10% for relevant boundary parameter of the speed profiles (i.e., mean, initial, and final speed) on any road segment; the traffic microscopic emissions model is able to reduce the estimation error by more than 50% with respect to reference macroscopic models for major pollutants such as NOx and CO2 . Such a high-resolution road traffic emissions model at the scale of every road segment in the network proves to be highly beneficial as a source for air quality models and as a monitoring tool for cities.

We then proposed a deep learning method of transfer learning (TL) for further improvement in prediction accuracy. Our selected final prediction techniques (TL1_IS or TL2-IS) achieved a balanced accuracy median (interquartile range) of 66(56~76) % for TL1_IS and 68(63~78) % for TL2_IS.

A small gap between site-based cross-validation (CV) R2 value (0. 73) and 10-fold CV R2 value (0.76), along with remarkable improvement in predictive accuracy (0.76) compared with previous studies (0.61), demonstrated the strong prediction capability of the space-time ensemble model in data mining. The higher wet NH4-N deposition fluxes mainly occurred in North China Plain (NCP), Sichuan Basin, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, whereas other regions retained the lower values. In addition, the wet NH4-N deposition fluxes, removing the precipitation effect in some major developed regions (e.g., Beijing and Shanghai) of China, displayed gradual increases from 2011 to 2014, while they suffered from dramatic decreases during 2014-2016, which was due to the strict implementation of the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP).

One of the key issues for existing AQP approaches is that air quality monitoring stations are sparsely distributed, typically with around ten monitoring stations per city. As air quality may change abruptly in a local area, it is difficult to perform AQP accurately in areas that are far away from observation points. In addition, due to the large distance between every two monitoring stations, we cannot effectively leverage spatial relations among them to improve the AQP accuracy. In this paper, thanks to the development of low-cost air quality sensors, we are now able to collect a large-scale air quality dataset with 393 deployed air quality monitoring stations in a 120 km Ã 70 km region, which is more than ten times denser than existing AQP datasets. Further, we present a novel method to handle the data effectively. Specifically, we first convert the observed data from irregularly distributed monitoring stations into a regular image-like pollution map, which can then be processed with advanced deep convolutional networks.

This study aims to explore the performances of an advanced machine learning (ML) method, the boosted regression trees (BRT) technique, in exploring the relationships between surface O3 and its driving factors, and in predicting the levels of O3 concentrations. To this end, a BRT model was trained on hourly data of air pollutants and meteorological parameters, acquired, over the 2016Â2018 period, in a rural area affected by an anthropic source of air pollutants. The abilities of the BRT model in ranking, visualizing, and predicting the relationship between ground-level O3 concentrations and its driving factors were analyzed and illustrated. A comparison with a multiple linear regression (MLR) model was performed based on several statistical indicators. The results obtained indicated that the BRT model was able to account for 81% of changes in O3 concentrations; it slightly outperforms the MLR model in terms of the predictions accuracy and allows a better identification of the main factors influencing O3 variability on a local scale. This knowledge is expected to be useful in defining effective measures to prevent and/or mitigate the health damages associated with O3 exposure. Â© 2020 by the authors.

Fine particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) is a very harmful air pollutant that is linked with many diseases. In this study, we created a machine learning-based scheme to estimate PM2.5 using various open data such as satellite remote sensing, meteorological data, and land variables to increase the limited spatial coverage provided by ground-monitors. A space-time extremely randomised trees model was used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations over Europe, this model achieved good results with an out-of-sample cross-validated R-2 of 0.69, RMSE of 5 mu g/m(3), and MAE of 3.3 mu g/m(3). The outcome of this study is a daily full coverage PM2.5 dataset with 1 km spatial resolution for the three-year period of 2018-2020. We found that air quality improved throughout the study period over all countries in Europe. In addition, we compared PM2.5 levels during the COVID-19 lockdown during the months March-June with the average of the previous 4 months and the following 4 months. We found that this lockdown had a positive effect on air quality in most parts of the study area except for the United Kingdom, Ireland, north of France, and south of Italy.

Standard stations, installed by governments with a high cost, can provide reliable air quality information; whereas a large number of portable air monitoring sensors with low cost are widely used and output less precise results. In this paper, we propose a category-based calibration approach (CCA) using machine learning algorithms for such portable sensors. Compared with traditional methods that often learn a single regression model, CCA includes multiple regression models according to pollutant concentration categories, and builds a more accurate mapping from sensor readings to reference. Furthermore, CCA introduces two fault-tolerance modules: Classification tolerance and sample tolerance. The former mitigates the impact of misclassification for concentration category, and the latter improves the robustness of individual regression model. Our approach is evaluated on carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) from two cities of China. The experiment results show that CCA has a better performance than traditional calibration models in both accuracy and robustness.

Powered by the data obtained from air pollution monitoring stations, we now have a chance to build sophisticated models to estimate the future concentration of various air pollutants. Previous researches show that deep learning models perform a better task of capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics from the data as compared to traditional statistical models. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning framework -AGCTCN (Attention based Graph Convolution and Temporal Convolution Network), based on spatial attention, graph convolution and temporal convolution is presented for short-term forecasting of particulate matter (PM) levels. Specifically, quarter-hourly PM(10 )and PM2.5 data aggregated from 27 ground air pollution monitoring stations in Delhi, India is used for training the AGCTCN model and our model forecasts the concentrations of these pollutants at these stations for a particular horizon in the future. The forecasts generated by our model are compared and contrasted to those generated by other state-of-the-art models like GC-LSTM and ConvLSTM with respect to four widely used evaluation metrics namely RMSE (root mean squared error), MAE (mean absolute error), correlation coefficient, and R-2 (coefficient of determination). Our model shows more than 80% improvement over the GC-LSTM model in terms of the R-2 metric, performs the best task of estimating the peak PM concentrations and shows variability and correlation close to that of the observed data. A carefully conducted ablation study shows the effectiveness of the individual components of our architecture.

Here, we performed 20-s resolution observations of O3 precursors and meteorological factors to train a random forest model capable of accurately predicting O3 concentrations. Our model performed well with an average validated R2 of 0.997. Unlike in typical linear model frameworks, variable dependencies are not clearly modelled by random forest model. Thus, we conducted additional studies to provide insight into the photochemical and atmospheric dynamic processes driving variations in O3 concentrations. At nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentrations of 10Â20 ppb, all the other O3 precursors were in states that increased the production of O3. Over a short timescale, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can almost track each high-frequency variation in O3. Meteorological factors play a more important role than O3 precursors do in predicting O3 concentrations at a high temporal resolution; however, individual meteorological factors are not sufficient to track every high-frequency change in O3. Nevertheless, the sharp variations in O3 related to flow dynamics are often accompanied by steep temperature changes. Our results suggest that high-temporal-resolution observations, both ground-based and vertical profiles, are necessary for the accurate assessment of human exposure to O3 and the success and accountability of the emission control strategies for improving air quality.

Except static official air quality stations, mobile sensing systems are deployed for urban air pollution monitoring to achieve larger sensing coverage and greater sampling granularity. However, the data sparsity and irregularity also bring great challenges for pollution map recovery. To address these problems, we propose a deep autoencoder framework based inference algorithm. Under the framework, a partially observed pollution map formed by the irregular samples are input into the model, then an encoder and a decoder work together to recover the entire pollution map. Inside the decoder, we adopt a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model by revealing its physical interpretation with an atmospheric dispersion model, and further present a weather-related ConvLSTM to enable quasi real-time applications. To evaluate our algorithm, a half-year data collection was deployed with a real-world system on a coastal area including the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city in north China.

Objective: To help OED managers to schedule medical resource allocation during times of excessive health care demands after short-term fluctuations in air pollution and weather, we employed machine learning (ML) methods to predict the peak OED arrivals of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Methods: In this paper, we first identified 13,218 visits from patients with chronic respiratory diseases to OEDs in hospitals from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017. Then, we divided the data into three datasets: weather-based visits, air quality-based visits, and weather air quality-based visits. Finally, we developed ML methods to predict the peak event (peak demand days) of patients with chronic respiratory diseases (eg, asthma, respiratory infection, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) visiting OEDs on the three weather data and environmental pollution datasets in Guangzhou, China. Results: The adaptive boosting-based neural networks, tree bag, and random forest achieved the biggest receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, 0.698, 0.714, and 0.809, on the air quality dataset, the weather dataset, and weather air quality dataset, respectively. Overall, random forests reached the best classification prediction performance. Conclusions: The proposed ML methods may act as a useful tool to adapt medical services in advance by predicting the peak of OED arrivals.

It can remove the random fluctuations and noise contained in the data. The SSA method consists of two steps: decomposition and reconstruction. Firstly, the original time series is transformed into a trajectory matrix, and then the matrix is decomposed into multiple matrices with eigenvalues arranged from largest to smallest. Next, a portion of matrices with larger eigenvalues are selected for reconstruction and then transformed into one-dimensional data to complete the noise reduction of the data. SSA is used extensively in various fields because it processes data without prior information about the structure of the time series and completes a good noise reduction effect.",Yes,"Multivariate empirical modal decomposition (MEMD)

In addition to being directly affected by social activities and atmospheric emissions, the impacts of meteorological factors are also significant. Based on daily Air Quality Index (AQI) data and various meteorological parameters in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), this paper summarized the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of AQI over YRD, and quantitatively analyzed the contribution of different meteorological elements to air quality. We also evaluated different spatial interpolation methods to produce surface distribution of AQI, and noted that the Ordinary Kriging outperformed other methods. The spatial distribution of AQI in YRD showed seasonal and annual variations. However, the days with AQI over 100 (level ii) were mostly observed in winter. Generally, more severe air pollution was observed in the northern part of YRD than in the southern ones, for example the air quality of the Ningbo metropolitan area was the best, while in Hefei it was the worst. It was found that meteorological parameters have spatially varying effects on AQI. For instance, pressure has a significant positive effect on AQI, and others showed negative correlations. We also predicted AQI by exploiting different machine learning-based models. Through model compari-son, it was found that the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model Â ARIMA (0,1,2) has higher prediction accuracy for AQI than Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The findings of this research can be used in future forecasting of air pollution, and also in air pollution con-trolling programs. Â© 2020, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

Although earlier works have improved a variety of predictive models of air pollution, the ability to accurately predict air pollution indices remains elusive. Time series prediction plays an important role in many fields. Some predecessors have experimented with artificial neural networks (NNs), combining linear autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models with nonlinear NN models. The typical assumption is that time series has a long signal with no white noise. However, a real-time short signal with white noise is common. The methods in the literature also do not guarantee that the prediction error of an NN model is minimized. Therefore, we propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to predict future PM2.5 values. First, we use the Q-learning algorithm in RL based on its state characteristics on the NN model. Second, we select the input with different input dimensions and values of time delay, calculate the best strategy, and evaluate the computational complexity of our RL algorithm.

With this, we are using IoT techniques for monitoring the emission rates of vehicles. A predictive model is built on the real-time data available, predicting the values of carbon monoxide. Sensors are embedded in the vehicles to measure the pollutants levels. By using the monitoring techniques, vehicle details such as location, owner is notified with the current situation of pollution in his location and his vehicle emission rate contributing to environment. Machine learning model is used for the prediction of pollution level in the vehicle location based on the previous data and the current data obtained by the sensors. Here the pollutants level can be controlled using smart emission surveillance system.

In this paper, we concentrate on resolving this difficulty. Unlike existing deep learning frameworks which lack generalization ability because they were developed for specific data instances, our proposed model aggregates simple deep convolutional neural networks but attains excellent performance. In order to capture the different aspects of smoke, we define a set of feature maps that are fed to a set of subnetworks. Each subnetwork is independently trained to deliver good detection performance. A final output is obtained by selectively aggregating the subnetwork responses via majority voting.

Given that any long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution has devastating health consequences, accurately monitoring and reporting air pollution information to the public is critical for ensuring public health and safety, while facilitating rigorous air pollution and health-related scientific research. Recent statistical research examining China's air quality data has posed questions on data accuracy, especially data reported during the Blue Sky Day (BSD) period (2000-2012), even though the quality of publicly available air quality data in China has improved substantially over the recent years (2013-2017).

However, existing air quality forecasting models mainly focus on site-specific time series forecasts at a local level, and rarely consider the spatiotemporal relationships among regional monitoring stations. As a novelty, we construct a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network (DCRNN) model that fully considers the influence of geographic distance and dominant wind direction on the regional variations in air quality through different combinations of directed and undirected graphs. The hourly fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) and ozone data from 123 air quality monitoring stations in the Yangtze River Delta, China are used to evaluate the performance of the DCRNN model in the regional prediction of PM2.5 and ozone concentrations. Results show that the proposed DCRNN model outperforms the baseline models in prediction accuracy. Compared with the undirected graph model, the directed graph model considering the effects of wind direction performs better in 24 h predictions of pollutant concentrations. In addition, more accurate forecasts of both PM2.5 and ozone are found at a regional level where monitoring stations are distributed densely rather than sparsely. Therefore, the proposed model can assist environmental researchers to further improve the technologies of air quality forecasts and could also serve as tools for environmental policymakers to implement pollution control measures.

The 2020 COVID-19 lockdown measures can be seen as an unintended but effective experiment to assess the impact of traffic restriction policies on air pollution. Our objective was to estimate the impact of the lockdown measures on NO2 concentrations and health in the two largest Italian cities. Methods NO2 concentration datasets were built using data deriving from a 1-month citizen science monitoring campaign that took place in Milan and Rome just before the Italian lockdown period. Annual mean NO2 concentrations were estimated for a lockdown scenario (Scenario 1) and a scenario without lockdown (Scenario 2), by applying city-specific annual adjustment factors to the 1-month data. The latter were estimated deriving data from Air Quality Network stations and by applying a machine learning approach. NO2 spatial distribution was estimated at a neighbourhood scale by applying Land Use Random Forest models for the two scenarios. Finally, the impact of lockdown on health was estimated by subtracting attributable deaths for Scenario 1 and those for Scenario 2, both estimated by applying literature-based dose-response function on the counterfactual concentrations of 10 mu g/m(3). Results The Land Use Random Forest models were able to capture 41-42% of the total NO2 variability. Passing from Scenario 2 (annual NO2 without lockdown) to Scenario 1 (annual NO2 with lockdown), the population-weighted exposure to NO2 for Milan and Rome decreased by 15.1% and 15.3% on an annual basis. Considering the 10 mu g/m(3) counterfactual, prevented deaths were respectively 213 and 604. Conclusions Our results show that the lockdown had a beneficial impact on air quality and human health. However, compliance with the current EU legal limit is not enough to avoid a high number of NO2 attributable deaths. This contribution reaffirms the potentiality of the citizen science approach and calls for more ambitious traffic calming policies and a re-evaluation of the legal annual limit value for NO2 for the protection of human health.",ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,10.1186/s12940-021-00825-9,5,3,No,,,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, PM2.5 remote sensing methods have been widely developed and applied in multiple environmentally related research areas in recent decades. Hence, the purpose of this review is to summarize these methods, required input data and main applications of PM2.5 and its remote sensing components. Recent Findings In general, two-step methods have been used for estimating PM2.5, which first retrieves the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and estimates PM2.5 from the AOD with other supplemental data containing the temporal or spatial variation impact on PM2.5 or data correlated with PM2.5 variation by different AOD-PM2.5 models. The AOD-PM2.5 models have been developed by using different methods, including empirical-statistical models (single or combined statistical models and big data-based machine learning methods), CTM-based models and semi-empirical/physical models. Current research can provide high-resolution (e.g. daily variations at 1 km and hourly variations at similar to 1 km) PM2.5 products, which have been widely used in air pollution management, health impact assessments, numerical data assimilation and climate impact analyses. This review summarizes the current research on method development, application, achievement and remaining challenges in remote sensing of PM2.5 and its components, which are essential for further improvement of the methods and accuracy of PM2.5 remote sensing and are likely applicable to other PM2.5 component remote sensing methods in the future.",CURRENT POLLUTION REPORTS,10.1007/s40726-020-00170-4,8,3,No,,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most Chilean cities are highly contaminated by particulate matter, especially during the months of April to August (the critical episode management period). The objective of this study is to predict particulate matter levels based on meteorological and climatic features, such as temperature, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation and relative air humidity in Talca, Chile, during the critical episode management periods between 2014 and 2018. Predictive models based on machine learning techniques were used, considering training datasets with meteorological and climatic data, and particulate matter levels from the three air quality monitoring stations in Talca, Chile. We carried out the training of 24 models to predict particulate matter levels considering the 24-h average and average between 05:00 to 11:00 p.m. For the model testing, data from the year 2018 during the critical episode management period were used. The obtained results indicate that our models are able to effectively predict levels of particulate matter, enabling correct management of critical episodes, especially for alert, pre-emergency and emergency conditions.

Achieving accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration has become an important research task. However, PM2.5 pollutants can spread in the earthÂs atmosphere, causing mutual influence between different cities. To effectively capture the air pollution relationship between cities, this paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal model combining graph attention neural network (GAT) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), named GAT-GRU for PM2.5 concentration prediction. Specifically, GAT is used to learn the spatial dependence of PM2.5 concentration data in different cities, and GRU is to extract the temporal dependence of the long-term data series. The proposed model integrates the learned spatio-temporal dependencies to capture long-term complex spatio-temporal features. Considering that air pollution is related to the meteorological conditions of the city, the knowledge acquired from meteorological data is used in the model to enhance PM2.5 prediction performance. The input of the GAT-GRU model consists of PM2.5 concentration data and meteorological data. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed GAT-GRU prediction model, this paper designs experiments on real-world datasets compared with other baselines. Experimental results prove that our model achieves excellent performance in PM2.5 concentration prediction. Â© 2022 Tech Science Press.

However, existing prediction methods mostly emphasize the fitting analysis of time series, but ignore the spatial propagation effect among nearby places, resulting in a low prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel synthesis prediction method to simultaneously excavate the time series changing law and the spatial propagation effect. This method combines a characterization model named air quality spatial-temporal network (AQSTN) and a neural network model called graph convolution neural network (GCN). Firstly, by calculating three correlation coefficients, the time series of most related meteorological factors and aerosol data are gained for feature construction. The geographic distances between locations are computed to evaluate the spatial propagation cost. After that, AQSTN with locations as nodes and propagation relations as edges is constructed, compositing the temporal and spatial relationships. The network is regarded as graph data and input into GCN in chronological order. Secondly, GCN processing graph-structured data fits the optimal parameters in the training stage, simultaneously analyzes the spatial and temporal dimensions of the target site and its adjacent sites. And, the predicted PM 2.5 concentration is gained in the test stage. The near-surface monitoring data of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area are adopted for experiment. Compared with the second-best model, the RMSE value of AQSTN-GCN is 6.85% lower, MAE value is 13.79% lower, MSE value is 13.23% lower, and MAPE value is 21.53% lower.

We used deep learning algorithms to derive novel metrics of greenspace (e.g., %trees, %grass) from SVI within 250m of participant residential addresses during 2007-2010 (mid-childhood, mean age 7.9 years) and 2012-2016 (early adolescence, 13.2y) (N = 533).

We used linear regression to examine cross-sectional and prospective associations of mid-childhood and early adolescence greenspace exposure with early adolescence sleep, adjusting for confounders. We compared associations with satellite-based greenspace (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI).

The association between greenspace and sleep differed by racial and socioeconomic subgroups. For example, among Black participants, higher NDVI was associated with better sleep, in neighborhoods with low socio-economic status (SES), higher %grass was associated with worse sleep, and in neighborhoods with high SES, higher total greenspace and %grass were associated with better sleep time.

The global population mainly using solid fuels for cooking remains large. Besides cooking, large amounts of coal and biomass fuels are burned for space heating during cold seasons in many regions. In this study, a wintertime multiple-region field campaign was carried out in north China to evaluate indoor PM2.5 variations. With hourly resolved data from ∼1600 households, key influencing factors of indoor PM2.5 were identified from a machine learning approach, and a random forest regression (RFR) model was further developed to quantitatively assess the impacts of household energy transition on indoor PM2.5. The indoor PM2.5 concentration averaged at 120 μg/m3 but ranged from 16 to ∼400 μg/m3. Indoor PM2.5 was ∼60% lower in families using clean heating approaches compared to those burning traditional coal or biomass fuels. The RFR model had a good performance (R2 = 0.85), and the interpretation was consistent with the field observation. A transition to clean coals or biomass pellets can reduce indoor PM2.5 by 20%, and further switching to clean modern energies would reduce it an additional 30%, suggesting many significant benefits in promoting clean transitions in household heating activities. © 2023 American Chemical Society",Environmental Science and Technology,10.1021/acs.est.3c02014,3,3,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of PM2.5 is meaningful for the prevention and control of air pollution. Satellite remote sensing has become an effective way to observe PM2.5 concentrations. However, most studies have focused on mapping PM2.5 concentrations from satellite-derived daytime aerosol optical depth (AOD), which cannot effectively depict the nighttime atmospheric environment. This paper aims to develop a method to derive nighttime PM2.5 concentrations in Nanjing, China, using the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP)/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime light remote sensing data during September–December 2020. The relationship between the satellite at-sensor radiance, PM2.5 concentrations and other environmental factors was first explored based on the nighttime radiative transfer equation. Taking into account the pixel direct radiation and the background scattered radiation, the spatial independent variables for estimating nighttime PM2.5 were determined. Five machine learning algorithms and multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed to develop models to estimate nighttime PM2.5 concentrations. The results showed that the MLR model had obviously lower accuracy than the machine learning models, and the RF model outperformed the other models, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.81 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.85 μg·m−3. Then, the developed model was applied to map the nighttime PM2.5 concentrations over Nanjing, which well characterized the nighttime atmospheric environment at a fine resolution.

This study uses deep learning (DL) to accurately estimate daily maximum 8-hr average (MDA8) ozone and examines the spatial contribution of several factors on ozone levels over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) in 2019. A comparison between in-situ observations and DL-estimated MDA8 ozone values shows a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95, an index of agreement (IOA) of 0.97, and a mean absolute bias (MAB) of 2.79 ppb, highlighting the promising performance of the deep convolutional neural network (Deep-CNN) at estimating surface MDA8 ozone. Spatial cross-validation also confirms the high spatial accuracy of the model, which obtains an R of 0.91, and IOA of 0.96 and an MAB of 3.46 ppb when it is trained and tested on separate stations. To interpret the black-box nature of our DL model, we use Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to generate a spatial feature contribution map (SFCM), the results of which confirm an advanced ability of Deep-CNN to capture the interactions between most predictor variables and ozone. For instance, the model shows that solar radiation (SRad) SFCM, with higher values, enhances the formation of ozone, particularly in the south and southwestern CONUS. As SRad triggers ozone precursors to produce ozone via photochemical reactions, it increases ozone concentrations. The model also shows that humidity, with its low values, increases ozone concentrations in the western mountainous regions. The negative correlation between humidity and ozone levels can be attributed to factors such as higher ozone decomposition resulting from increased levels of humidity and OH radicals. This study is the first to introduce the SFCM to investigate the spatial role of predictor variables on changes in estimated MDA8 ozone levels. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121508,3,3,Yes,DCNN,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traffic flow prediction plays an important role in this connection. In this paper, an ensemble short-term traffic flow prediction method based on optimized variational mode decomposition (OVMD) and combined long short-term memory network (LSTM) is proposed. The method consists of three main components: 1. Use the improved bat algorithm to optimize the parameters of VMD to achieve better decomposition effect; 2. Use the optimized variational mode decomposition algorithm (OVMD) to decompose the unstable original traffic flow time series data into relatively stable multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs); 3. The optimized L-BILSTM model is established by combining the basic long short-term memory network with the bidirectional long short-term memory network. It can better extract information from traffic flow data and improve the accuracy of prediction results.

Upon model evaluation, the correlation of the RFR model was 0.92, and the probability of detection for ozone exceedances using k-nearest neighbors was 0.81 for the most recent years of the analysis (2014-2018). We also ran a 4 km Community Multiscale Air Quality model simulation to generate air pollution estimates over Southern California. As expected, ozone in Fontana was positively correlated with temperature. The ozone exceedance hours usually occurred when the temperature was above 25 °C, and the wind direction was from 270° (westerly). Ozone sensitivity as a function of temperature and NOx was also examined. Observed troughs in hourly NOx concentrations during midday under high temperatures suggests that most of the ambient NOx reacted, also as expected. The results indicate that machine learning can support state implementation planning by complementing traditional air quality modeling, reducing simulation time, and exploiting large datasets for historical simulations and future air quality predictions. © 2023 RSC.",Environmental Science: Atmospheres,10.1039/d2ea00077f,3,3,Yes,RF,,,"United States,Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Demand-based Ventilation (DCV) determines the operational times of ventilation systems that depend on indoor air quality (IAQ) conditions, including CO2 concentration changes, and the occupants’ comfort requirements. The prediction of CO2 concentration changes can act as a proxy estimator of occupancy changes and provide feedback about the utility of current ventilation controls. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Model for CO2 Variation Predictions (HMCOVP) to accurately predict these variations. The proposed framework addresses two concerns in state-of-the-art implementations. First, the hierarchical structure enables fine-tuning of the produced models, facilitating their transferability to different spatial settings. Second, the formulation incorporates time dependencies, defining the relationship between different IAQ factors. Toward that goal, the HMCOVP decouples the variation prediction into two complementary steps. The first step transforms lagged versions of environmental features into image representations to predict the variations’ direction. The second step combines the first step’s result with environment-specific historical data to predict CO2 variations. Through the HMCOVP, these predictions, which outperformed state-of-the-art approaches, help the ventilation systems in their decision-making processes, reducing energy consumption and carbon-based emissions. © 2023 by the authors.",Algorithms,10.3390/a16050256,3,3,No,,,,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study uses ground-level maximum daily 8-hour ozone average (MDA8 O3) as an example to examine O3 responses to local anthropogenic NOx and VOC emissions in Taiwan by Response Surface Modeling (RSM). Three different datasets for RSM were examined, including the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model data, ML-measurement-model fusion (ML-MMF) data, and ML data, which respectively represent direct numerical model predictions, numerical predictions adjusted by observations and other auxiliary data, and ML predictions based on observations and other auxiliary data. The results show that both ML-MMF (r = 0.93–0.94) and ML predictions (r = 0.89–0.94) present significantly improved performance in the benchmark case compared with CMAQ predictions (r = 0.41–0.80). While ML-MMF isopleths exhibit O3 nonlinearity close to actual responses due to their numerical base and observation-based correction, ML isopleths present biased predictions concerning their different controlled ranges of O3 and distorted O3 responses to NOx and VOC emission ratios compared with ML-MMF isopleths, which implies that using data without support from CMAQ modeling to predict the air quality could mislead the controlled targets and future trends. Meanwhile, the observation-corrected ML-MMF isopleths also emphasize the impact of transboundary pollution from mainland China on the regional O3 sensitivity to local NOx and VOC emissions, which transboundary NOx would make all air quality regions in April more sensitive to local VOC emissions and limit the potential effort by reducing local emissions. Future ML applications in atmospheric science like forecasting or bias correction should provide interpretability and explainability, except for meeting statistical performance and providing variable importance. Assessment with interpretable physical and chemical mechanisms and constructing a statistically robust ML model should be equally important. © 2023",Environment International,10.1016/j.envint.2023.107969,3,3,No,,,,"United States,Taiwan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The worsening air quality in most of the cities has gone to an extent of causing severe impact on human health and life expectancy. An early warning system where people are alerted well before an adverse air quality episode can go a long way in preventing exposure to harmful air conditions. Having such system can also help the government to take better mitigation and preventive measures. Forecasting systems based on machine learning are gaining importance due to their cost-effectiveness and applicability to small towns and villages, where most complex models are not feasible due to resource constraints and limited data availability. This paper presents a study of air quality forecasting by application of statistical models. Three statistical models based on autoregression (AR), moving average (MA), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were applied to the datasets of PM2.5 concentrations of Delhi and Bengaluru, and forecasting was done for 1-day-ahead and 7-day-ahead time frames. All three models forecasted the PM2.5 reasonably well for Bengaluru, but the model performance deteriorated for the Delhi region. The AR, MA, and ARIMA models achieved mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10.82%, 7.94%, and 8.17% respectively for forecast of 7 days and MAPE of 7.35%, 5.62%, and 5.87% for 1-day-ahead forecasts for Bengaluru. For the Delhi region, the model gave an MAPE of 27.82%, 24.62%, and 27.32% for the AR, MA, and ARIMA models respectively in the 7-day-ahead forecast, and 24.48%, 23.53%, and 23.72% respectively for 1-day-ahead forecast. The analysis showed that ARIMA model performs better in comparison to the other models but performance varies with varying concentration regimes.

According to datacommons.org, India's CO2 emission is 1.80 tnes per capita, which is harmful to living beings: hence, this study exhibits India's harmful CO2 emission effect and forecasts CO2 emission for the next ten years using univariate time-series data from 1980 to 2019. A multilayer perceptron is used in this study to analyse 2099 experimental data of binary systems made up of CO2 and ionic liquids and predict solubility. 33 different types of ionic liquids are represented in the dataset, which spans a wide variety of solubilities, pressures, and temperatures. In recent decades, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have caused air pollution and environmental problems in several countries. A precise prediction is essential for managing and planning for the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the Modified Coyote Optimization Algorithm was used to extract required properties. The empirical data revealed that predictions obtained from Multi-Layer Perceptron's Neural Network (MPNN) were more accurate than those derived from other models. The MPNN-MCOA identified a link between CO2 emissions, economic growth, and entrepreneurship. Government, personal liberty, education, and pollution all have a negative correlation. We conclude by emphasising the critical role of machine learning in achieving carbon neutrality, from global-scale energy management to the revolutionary potential of atomic-scale MPNN-MCOA simulations for application development. As a result, one of the most reliable approaches for estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural regions and companies was recommended: the MPNN-MCOA model. The Artificial neural network is trained with three input combinations with three combinations of thermodynamic variables such as temperature (T), pressure (P), critical temperature (Tc), critical pressure, the critical compressibility factor (Zc), and the acentric factor (w).

Accurate AQI prediction is critical for controlling air pollution. This study proposes a new spatio-temporal correlation hybrid prediction model ST-EXMG-AE-XGBoost. The process of building this model includes three stages. In the first stage, Pearson correlation analysis is performed on different AQI monitoring stations to capture their temporal correlation characteristics. The prediction models T-ELM, T-XGBoost, and T-MLP are built in turn. In the second stage, GAT captures the spatial correlation characteristics, and the prediction model S-GAT is made. In the third stage, the prediction results of T-ELM, T-XGBoost, T-MLP, and S-GAT are learned, and features are reconstructed using the AE autoencoder. In contrast, the spatio-temporal association prediction is performed using the XGBoost method afterward. Through the prediction study of historical data from AQI monitoring stations in Shunyi District, Beijing, the following conclusions can be drawn: (a) compared with deep learning models such as LSTM and TCN, the classical models such as ELM, MLP, and XGBoost still have good application value with high prediction accuracy and short training time; (b) compared with single prediction models, the proposed temporal correlation prediction methods T-ELM, T-MLP, and T-XGBoost further improve the AQI prediction effect; (c) the use of GAT method can effectively explore the spatial connectivity characteristics between different AQI monitoring stations; (d) the proposed spatio-temporal correlation hybrid prediction model ST-EXMG-AE-XGBoost performs the best among all the models involved and has good application prospects. © 2023 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",Atmospheric Pollution Research,10.1016/j.apr.2023.101717,3,3,Yes,"ELM,XGB",,Yes,China,Forecast,AQI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the key drivers behind the O3 formation and developing an accurate and efficient method for timely assessing the O3–VOCs-NOx relationships applicable in different O3 pollution events are essential. Here, we developed a novel machine learning ensemble model coupled with a Shapley additive explanation algorithm to predict the O3 formation regime and derive O3 formation sensitivity curves. The algorithm was tested for O3 events during the COVID-19 lockdown, a sandstorm event, and a heavy O3 pollution episode (maximum hourly O3 concentration >200 μg/m3) from 2019 to 2021. We show that increasing O3 concentrations during the COVID-19 lockdown and the heavy O3 pollution event were mainly caused by the photochemistry subject to local air quality and meteorological conditions. Influenced by the sandstorm weather, low O3 levels were mainly attributable to weak sunlight and low precursor levels. O3 formation sensitivity curves demonstrate that O3 formation in the study area was in a VOCs-sensitive regime. The VOCs-specific O3 sensitivity curves can also help make hybrid and timely strategies for O3 abatement. The results demonstrate that machine learning driven by observational data has the potential to be a very useful tool in predicting and interpreting O3 formation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120798,3,3,Yes,"RF,GBM,MLP,ELM,SHAP",ENS,No,China,,O3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a motivating example, some scientists have warned recently that ammonia from the production of meat significantly increases human mortality rates in exposed populations by increasing the ambient concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in air. We reexamine the support for such conclusions, including quantitative calculations that attribute deaths to PM2.5 air pollution by applying associational results such as relative risks, odds ratios, or slope coefficients from regression models to predict the effects on mortality or morbidity of reducing PM2.5 exposures. Taking an outside perspective from the field of causal artificial intelligence (CAI), we conclude that these attribution calculations are methodologically unsound. They produce unreliable conclusions because they ignore an essential distinction between differences in outcomes observed at different levels of exposure and changes in outcomes caused by changing exposure. We find that multiple studies that have examined associations between changes over time in particulate exposure and mortality risk instead of differences in exposures and corresponding mortality risks have found no clear evidence that observed changes in exposure help to predict or explain subsequent changes in mortality risks. We conclude that there is no sound theoretical or empirical reason to believe that reducing ammonia emissions from farms has reduced or would reduce human mortality risks. More generally, applying CAI principles and methods can potentially improve current widespread practices of unsound causal inferences and policy-relevant causal claims that are made without the benefit of formal causal analysis in air pollution health effects research and in other areas of applied epidemiology and public health risk assessment. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Environmental Research,10.1016/j.envres.2023.115311,3,3,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using a nationwide surveillance-based case-control design in China, we examined the association between maternal exposure to PM2.5 during periconception (defined as 3 months before conception until 3 months into pregnancy) and risk of CHD in offspring. The study included 1 434 998 births involving 7335 CHDs from 2014 through 2017 on the basis of the National Population-Based Birth Defects Surveillance System, covering 30 provinces, municipalities, or municipal districts in China. We assigned maternal PM2.5 exposure during the periconception period to each participant using satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations at 1-km spatial resolution. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to calculate the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio and 95% CI for CHDs in offspring associated with maternal PM2.5 exposure, and the exposure–response association was investigated using restricted cubic spline analysis. Subgroup or sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify factors that may modify the association. RESULTS: The average maternal exposure to PM2.5 levels across all participants was 56.51 µg/m3 (range, 10.95 to 182.13 µg/m3). For each 10 µg/m3 increase in maternal PM2.5 exposure, the risk of CHDs in offspring was increased by 2% (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.05]), and septal defect was the most influenced subtype (odds ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.08]). The effect of PM2.5 on CHD risk was more pronounced during the preconception period. Mothers <35 years of age, those living in northern China, and those living in low-income areas were more susceptible to PM2.5 exposure than their counterparts (all P<0.05). PM2.5 exposure showed a linear association with total CHDs or specific CHD types. CONCLUSIONS: High maternal PM2.5 exposure, especially during the preconception period, increases risk of certain types of CHD in offspring. These findings are useful for CHD prevention and highlight the public health benefits of improving air quality in China and other highly polluted regions. © 2023 American Heart Association, Inc.",Circulation,10.1161/circulationaha.122.061245,3,3,No,,,,"China,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Air pollution and extreme temperature threaten sensitive groups’ lives, among which air pollution is most closely related to respiratory diseases. Owing to the skewed attention, timely intervention is necessary to better predict and warn the occurrence of death from respiratory diseases. In this paper, according to the existing research, based on a number of environmental monitoring data, the regression model is established by integrating the machine learning methods XGBoost, support vector machine (SVM), and generalized additive model (GAM) model. The distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) is used to set the warning threshold to transform the data and establish the warning model. According to the DLNM model, the cumulative lag effect of meteorological factors is explored. There is a cumulative lag effect between air temperature and PM2.5, which reaches the maximum when the lag is 3 days and 5 days, respectively. If the low temperature and high environmental pollutants (PM2.5) continue to influence for a long time, the death risk of respiratory diseases will continue to rise, and the early warning model based on DLNM has better performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1007/s11356-023-26017-1,3,3,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study integrated the advantages of convolutional neural network (CNN) feature extraction and the regression ability of random forest (RF) to propose a novel CNN-RF ensemble framework for PM2.5 concentration modeling. The observational data from 13 monitoring stations in Kaohsiung in 2021 were selected for model training and testing. First, CNN was implemented to extract key meteorological and pollution data. Subsequently, the RF algorithm was employed to train the model with five input factors, namely the extracted features from the CNN and spatiotemporal factors, including the day of the year, the hour of the day, latitude, and longitude. Independent observations from two stations were used to evaluate the models. The findings demonstrated that the proposed CNN–RF model had better modeling capability compared with the independent CNN and RF models: the average improvements in root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) ranged from 8.10% to 11.11%, respectively. In addition, the proposed CNN–RF hybrid model has fewer excess residuals at thresholds of 10 μg/m3, 20 μg/m3, and 30 μg/m3. The results revealed that the proposed CNN–RF ensemble framework is a stable, reliable, and accurate method that can generate superior results compared with the single CNN and RF methods.

Timely and accurate long- and short-term (LST) prediction of the on-road vehicle exhaust emission could contribute to atmospheric pollution prevention, public health protection, and government decision-making for environmental management. Vehicle exhaust emission has strong non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics due to the inherent randomness and imbalance nature of meteorological factors and traffic flow. Therefore accurate LST vehicle exhaust emission prediction encounters many challenges, such as the LST temporal dependencies and complicated nonlinear correlation on various emission gases, including carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and nitric oxide (NO), and external influence factors. To resolve these challenging issues, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework, namely Dual Attention-based Fusion Network (DAFNet), to effectively predict LST multivariate vehicle exhaust emission with the temporal convolutional network, convolutional neural network, long short term memory (LSTM)-skip based on recurrent neural network, dual attention mechanism, and autoregressive decomposition model. The proposed DAFNet consists of three major parts: 1) a nonlinear component to effectively capture the dynamic LST temporal dependency of multivariate gas by the temporal convolutional network, convolutional neural network, and LSTM-skip. Moreover, the above two networks employ an attention mechanism to model the internal relevance of the LST temporal patterns and multivariate gas, respectively. 2) a linear component to tackle the scale-insensitive problem of the neural network model by an autoregressive decomposition model. 3) the external components are taken to compensate the impact of external factors on vehicle exhaust emission by the multilayer perceptron model. Finally, the proposed DAFNet is evaluated on two real-world vehicle emission datasets in Zibo and Hefei, China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DAFNet is a powerful tool to provide highly accurate prediction for LST multivariate vehicle exhaust emission in the field of vehicle environmental management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160490,3,3,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we performed a three-year mass balance study along a gradient of soil pollution near a smelter to quantify the potential contribution and net cadmium (Cd) fluxes and predict Cd concentration in rice grains by multiple regression (MR) and back propagation (BP) neural network. The Cd inputs were mainly from the irrigation water (54.6–60.8%) in the moderately polluted and background sites but from atmospheric deposition (90.9%) in the highly polluted site. The Cd outputs were mainly from the surface runoff (55.8–59.5%) in the moderately polluted and background sites, but from Sedum plumbizincicola phytoextraction (83.6%) in the highly polluted site. The soil Cd concentrations, the annual fluxes of atmospheric deposition, pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation water, surface runoff, and leaching water were selected as the dependent factors to predict Cd concentrations in rice grains. The genetic algorithms (GA)-BP neural network model gives the best prediction accuracy compared to the BP neural network model and multivariate regression analysis. The major implication is that the health risks through the consumption of rice can be rapidly assessed based on the Cd concentrations in rice grains predicted by the model. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Chemosphere,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138028,3,3,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the proposed approach can be used as a component of an early warning system in cities, contributing to sustainable air quality management in urban areas. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14030589,3,3,Yes,"LR,MLP",,,"Thailand,Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study area is Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, and the study period is from January 2015 to July 2022. During this period, Xi'an exceeded China's National Ambient Air Quality Grade Ⅰ standard for PM for up to 70% of the days. The prediction results of the TCN-LSTM model were compared with those of deep learning models (Convolutional Neural Network-LSTM, TCN, and LSTM) and machine learning models (Support Vector Regression and Random Forest). The R2 values of the TCN-LSTM model were all >0.88, indicating better performance than that of the other five models, and the errors of the TCN-LSTM model were all lower than those of the other five models. The results showed that high-accuracy PM predictions using deep learning models can improve air quality monitoring by compensating for problems in the environmental monitoring process such as pollutant monitoring errors caused by instrument failures. Additionally, sensitivity analysis helps to identify the key factors influencing the behavior of PM. A sensitivity analysis of PM for different periods of COVID-19 found that PM2.5 is more sensitive to O3, while PM10 is mainly influenced by PM2.5. The sensitivity analysis for the whole period showed that PM was closely related to CO. Removing variables that do not contribute to the model output based on the sensitivity analysis results improves modeling efficiency while reducing operating costs and improving environmental monitoring activities and management strategies. © 2023 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",Atmospheric Pollution Research,10.1016/j.apr.2023.101703,3,3,Yes,"TCNN,LSTM",,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we want to provide a reasonable basis for haze prevention, then the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations becomes a crucial task. However, it is difficult to complete the task of PM2.5 concentration prediction using a single model; therefore, to address this problem, this paper proposes a fully adaptive noise ensemble empirical modal decomposition (CEEMDAN) algorithm combined with deep learning hybrid models. Firstly, the CEEMDAN algorithm was used to decompose the PM2.5 timeseries data into different modal components. Then long short-term memory (LSTM), a backpropagation (BP) neural network, a differential integrated moving average autoregressive model (ARIMA), and a support vector machine (SVM) were applied to each modal component. Lastly, the best prediction results of each component were superimposed and summed to obtain the final prediction results. The PM2.5 data of Hangzhou in recent years were substituted into the model for testing, which was compared with eight models, namely, LSTM, ARIMA, BP, SVM, CEEMDAN–ARIMA, CEEMDAN–LSTM, CEEMDAN–SVM, and CEEMDAN–BP. The results show that for the coupled CEEMDAN–LSTM–BP–ARIMA model, the prediction ability was better than all the other models, and the timeseries decomposition data of PM2.5 had their own characteristics. The data with different characteristics were predicted separately using appropriate models and the final combined model results obtained were the most satisfactory. © 2022 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su142316128,6,3,Yes,"LSTM,BP,SVM,ARIMA",,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fully adaptive noise ensemble empirical modal decomposition (CEEMDAN) algorithm,,,,,,

Artificial neural network (ANN) and curve fitting (CF) models were created to forecast the R-Event. The R-Event is defined as the anticipated number of new infections that develop in particular events occurring over the course of time in any defined space. In the spring and summer of 2022, real-time data for an office environment were collected in India in a mixed-mode ventilated office space in a composite climate. The performances of the proposed CF and ANN models were compared with respect to traditional statistical indicators, such as the correlation coefficient, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, NS index, and a20-index, in order to determine the merit of the two approaches. Thirteen input features, namely the indoor temperature (TIn), indoor relative humidity (RHIn), area of opening (AO), number of occupants (O), area per person (AP), volume per person (VP), CO2 concentration (CO2), air quality index (AQI), outer wind speed (WS), outdoor temperature (TOut), outdoor humidity (RHOut), fan air speed (FS), and air conditioning (AC), were selected to forecast the R-Event as the target. The main objective was to determine the relationship between the CO2 level and R-Event, ultimately producing a model for forecasting infections in office building environments. The correlation coefficients for the CF and ANN models in this case study were 0.7439 and 0.9999, respectively. This demonstrates that the ANN model is more accurate in R-Event prediction than the curve fitting model. The results show that the proposed ANN model is reliable and significantly accurate in forecasting the R-Event values for mixed-mode ventilated offices. © 2022 by the authors.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,10.3390/ijerph192416862,5,3,No,,,,"India,Iraq,Saudi Arabia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The environment has been significantly impacted by rapid urbanization, leading to a need for changes in climate change and pollution indicators. The 4IR offers a potential solution to efficiently manage these impacts. Smart city ecosystems can provide well-designed, sustainable, and safe cities that enable holistic climate change and global warming solutions through various community-centred initiatives. These include smart planning techniques, smart environment monitoring, and smart governance. An air quality intelligence platform, which operates as a complete measurement site for monitoring and governing air quality, has shown promising results in providing actionable insights. This article aims to highlight the potential of machine learning models in predicting air quality, providing data-driven strategic and sustainable solutions for smart cities. Methods. This study proposed an end-to-end air quality predictive model for smart city applications, utilizing four machine learning techniques and two deep learning techniques. These include Ada Boost, SVR, RF, KNN, MLP regressor and LSTM. The study was conducted in four different urban cities in Selangor, Malaysia, including Petaling Jaya, Banting, Klang, and Shah Alam. The model considered the air quality data of various pollution markers such as PM2.5, PM10, O3, and CO. Additionally, meteorological data including wind speed and wind direction were also considered, and their interactions with the pollutant markers were quantified. The study aimed to determine the correlation variance of the dependent variable in predicting air pollution and proposed a feature optimization process to reduce dimensionality and remove irrelevant features to enhance the prediction of PM2.5, improving the existing LSTM model. The study estimates the concentration of pollutants in the air based on training and highlights the contribution of feature optimization in air quality predictions through feature dimension reductions. Results. In this section, the results of predicting the concentration of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, and CO) in the air are presented in R2 and RMSE. In predicting the PM10 and PM2.5 concentration, LSTM performed the best overall high R2 values in the four study areas with the R2 values of 0.998, 0.995, 0.918, and 0.993 in Banting, Petaling, Klang and Shah Alam stations, respectively. The study indicated that among the studied pollution markers, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, wind speed and humidity are the most important elements to monitor. By reducing the number of features used in the model the proposed feature optimization process can make the model more interpretable and provide insights into the most critical factor affecting air quality. Findings from this study can aid policymakers in understanding the underlying causes of air pollution and develop more effective smart strategies for reducing pollution levels. © Copyright 2023 Neo et al.",PeerJ Computer Science,10.7717/peerj-cs.1306,3,3,Yes,"AB,SVR,RF,KNN,MLP,LSTM",,,"Malaysia,Indonesia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severe air pollution can cause respiratory diseases, while good air quality is beneficial to physical and mental health. Therefore, the prediction of air quality is very important. Since the concentration data of air pollutants are time series, their time characteristics should be considered in their prediction. However, the traditional neural network for time series prediction is limited by its own structure, which makes it very easy for it to fall into a local optimum during the training process. The empirical mode decomposition fuzzy forecast model for air quality, which is based on the extreme learning machine, is proposed in this paper. Empirical mode decomposition can analyze the changing trend of air quality well and obtain the changing trend of air quality under different time scales. According to the changing trend under different time scales, the extreme learning machine is used for fast training, and the corresponding prediction value is obtained. The adaptive fuzzy inference system is used for fitting to obtain the final air quality prediction result. The experimental results show that our model improves the accuracy of both short-term and long-term prediction by about 30% compared to other models, which indicates the remarkable efficacy of our approach. The research of this paper can provide the government with accurate future air quality information, which can take corresponding control measures in a targeted manner. © 2022 by the authors.",Entropy,10.3390/e24121803,5,3,Yes,ELM,,,China,forecast,AQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,Empirical mode decomposition (EMD),,,,,

One of the biggest challenges posed by the rapid migration of inhabitants into cities is increased air pollution. Sustainable Development Goal 11 indicates that 99 percent of the world’s urban population breathes polluted air. In such a trend of urbanization, predicting the concentrations of pollutants in advance is very important. Predictions of pollutants would help city administrations to take timely measures for ensuring Sustainable Development Goal 11. In data engineering, imputation and the removal of outliers are very important steps prior to forecasting the concentration of air pollutants. For pollution and meteorological data, missing values and outliers are critical problems that need to be addressed. This paper proposes a novel method called multiple iterative imputation using autoencoder-based long short-term memory (MIA-LSTM) which uses iterative imputation using an extra tree regressor as an estimator for the missing values in multivariate data followed by an LSTM autoencoder for the detection and removal of outliers present in the dataset. The preprocessed data were given to a multivariate LSTM for forecasting PM2.5 concentration. This paper also presents the effect of removing outliers and missing values from the dataset as well as the effect of imputing missing values in the process of forecasting the concentrations of air pollutants. The proposed method provides better results for forecasting with a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 9.8883. The obtained results were compared with the traditional gated recurrent unit (GRU), 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) approaches for a dataset of the Aotizhonhxin area of Beijing in China. Similar results were observed for another two locations in China and one location in India.

This approach selects multivariate time series and coalesce a real time updatable autoregressive model to forecast Particulate matter (PM) PM2.5. To perform experimental analysis the data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is used.

Proposed method for air pollution prediction unveiled effective and moored performance in long term prediction. Dynamic budge with high weighted k-models are used simultaneously and devising an ensemble helps to achieve stable forecasting. Computational time of ensemble decreases with parallel processing in each sub model.

It goes without saying that solar energy has been demonstrated to be a key source of green energy. Solar energy is used because it is abundant, pollution-free, and easily available. However, the power utility market requires highly exact solar energy forecasts. These challenges need the creation of a device that can precisely predict solar energy output via processing the location's weather data, which is accomplished through the use of machine learning and multiple linear regression (MLR). Some elements, such as the number of cloudy days, humidity, temperature, wind condition, and precipitation, should be addressed while simulating solar power output. In this paper, a 12-kW photovoltaic (PV) system on the rooftop of a house in Isfahan was studied using the System Advisor Model (SAM). The most significant research contribution of the proposed paper is to predict the output power of a solar system with the lowest possible error. According to the simulation results, by using the MLR model, the predicted power has an error of 6 % with the actual power, which is a very good estimation. In addition, this system meets each household's energy needs plus an additional 8430 kWh per year, resulting in being paid by utility companies, a fewer number of outages, and lower air pollution levels. © 2022, Association for Scientific Computing Electronics and Engineering (ASCEE).

Exploring the relationship between air pollution and housing prices has become increasingly prominent. Current research on housing prices mainly uses the hedonic pricing model and the spatial econometric model, which are both linear methods. However, it is difficult to use these methods to model the nonlinear relationship between housing price and its determinants. In addition, most of the existing studies neglect the effects of multiple pollutants on housing prices. To fill these gaps, this study uses a machine learning approach, the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model to analyze the nonlinear impacts of air pollution and the built environment on housing prices in Shanghai. The experimental results show that the GBDT can better fit the nonlinear relationship between housing prices and various explanatory variables compared with traditional linear models. Furthermore, the relative importance rankings of the built environment and air pollution variables are analyzed based on the GBDT model. It indicates that built environment variables contribute 97.21% of the influences on housing prices, whereas the contribution of air pollution variables is 2.79%. Although the impact of air pollution is relatively small, the marginal willingness of residents to pay for clean air is significant. With an improvement of 1 mu g/m(3) in the average concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2, the average housing price increases by 155.93 Yuan/m(2) and 278.03 Yuan/m(2), respectively. Therefore, this study can improve our understanding of the nonlinear impact of air pollution on housing prices and provide a basis for formulating and revising policies related to housing prices.",ECONOMICS OF TRANSPORTATION,10.1016/j.ecotra.2022.100272,5,3,No,,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we characterize the PAHs in 1055 samples of urban soil collected in China from 2000 to 2020. The total concentration of PAHs ranged from 2.75 to 38,865 ng g(-1). PAHs concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta (YangtzeD) and Pearl River Delta exhibited an inverted U-shaped curve over time, and PAHs concentrations in Beijing have decreased. Air pollution prevention policies and vehicle emission standards in these regions reduced PAHs in the soil. We measured PAHs in soils of 18 major cities in YangtzeD, representing a typical area. Total concentration of PAHs was 3.88-2153 ng g(-1) in YangtzeD, with 40.5%, 36.3%, and 23.2% of PAHs coming from industry and transportation, coal combustion, and biomass combustion, respectively by Positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. To explore how human activities affect the PAH concentrations, we screened three machine learning models and selected SHapley Additive explanation-extreme gradient boosting (XGB-SHAP) as the best model. The results of XGB-SHAP (R-2 = 0.64) show that the main human activities affecting PAHs were carbon emissions, population size, and economic development (MAS = 709.1) and industrial waste gas emissions (MAS = 577.1), and these were positively correlated with PAHs. Therefore, effective ways to reduce PAHs may largely rely on industrial co-control.

Traditional PM2.5 monitoring uses ground -based monitoring stations with low spatial resolution. Other studies have retrieved the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aerosol optical depth product by the dark-target algorithm. However, the estimated PM2.5 concentration on the ground will produce missing values, which will lead to the reduction of spatial and temporal resolution. Based on this, this study proposes a machine learning algorithm to estimate PM2.5 by using the fifth generation reanalysis (ERA5) data set published by the European Center for Medium -range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In this study, two different methods of back propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) were used to develop the models. Firstly, the meteorological parameters (precipitable water vapor, water vapor pressure and relative humidity, etc.) and pollution parameters (O3, CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5) were used to establish PM2.5 model in 2021. The results showed that the R2 and RMSE for BPNN and RF were 0.94/0.96 and 10.37/8.77 mu g/m3, respectively. Then, due to the lack and the low spatial resolution of the pollution parameters, using only the ERA5 meteorological data with the high spatiotem-poral resolution to develop the PM2.5 model in winter, the R2 of the RF model (0.93) was 0.05 higher and the RMSE (12.50 mu g/m3) was 4.19 mu g/m3 lower than that of the BPNN model, which indicates that it is feasible to develop the PM2.5 model using only meteorological parameters. Finally, using the RF model of the second stage and ERA5 meteorological data with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees (obtained by cubic spline interpolation) to generate the hourly PM2.5 map of Beijing and compare it with China High Air Pollutants dataset, the R2 and RMSE of Beijing were 0.78 mu g/m3 and 14.85 mu g/m3, respectively. On this basis, it is found that the areas with high PM2.5 concen-tration are close to the areas with serious pollution in Hebei Province by analyzing the PM2.5 map of Beijing, and area transport and human activities are important sources of air pollution.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

The proposed paradigm involves four procedures: TITS construction in terms of the daily minimum, daily mean, and daily maximum AQI, multi-scale decomposition via MVMD, individual forecasting by MCPSO-optimized MVRVM, and ensemble learning forecasting using a simple addition approach. Experiments based on datasets collected from four mu-nicipalities in China demonstrated that the presented paradigm can hit higher accuracy than other comparable models, and the application analysis also shows that it has application potential in the AQI online forecasting system. To conclude, the proposed paradigm provides a promising alternative for AQI time series forecasting.",TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE,10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122504,3,3,"No, duplicated",,,,"Peoples R China,Denmark,Singapore",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a novel method for investigating the associations between air pollution exposure and disease is lacking. The objective of this study was to investigate whether long-term exposure to ambient particulate air pollution increases dementia risk using both the traditional Cox model approach and a novel machine learning (ML) with random forest (RF) method. We used health data from a national population-based cohort in Taiwan from 2000 to 2017. We collected the following ambient air pollution data from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA): fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and gaseous pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen oxide (NOx), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Spatiotemporal-estimated air quality data calculated based on a geostatistical approach, namely, the Bayesian maximum entropy method, were collected. Each subject's residential county and township were reviewed monthly and linked to air quality data based on the corresponding township and month of the year for each subject. The Cox model approach and the ML with RF method were used. Increasing the concentration of PM2.5 by one interquartile range (IQR) increased the risk of dementia by approximately 5% (HR = 1.05 with 95% CI = 1.04Â1.05). The comparison of the performance of the extended Cox model approach with the RF method showed that the prediction accuracy was approximately 0.7 by the RF method, but the AUC was lower than that of the Cox model approach. This national cohort study over an 18-year period provides supporting evidence that long-term particulate air pollution exposure is associated with increased dementia risk in Taiwan. The ML with RF method appears to be an acceptable approach for exploring associations between air pollutant exposure and disease.

The aethalometer method was used. Mean winter Cwood concentrations ranged from 0.26 ?g m?3 (in rural Scotland) to 1.30 ?g m?3 (London), which represented on average 4% (in rural environments) and 5% (urban) of PM10 concentrations; and 8% of PM2.5. Concentrations were greatest in the evenings in winter months, with larger evening concentrations in the weekends at the urban sites. Random-forest (RF) machine learning regression models were used to reconstruct Cwood concentrations using both meteorological and temporal explanatory variables at each site. The partial dependency plots indicated that temperature and wind speed were the meteorological variables explaining the greatest variability in Cwood, with larger concentrations during cold and calm conditions. Peaks of Cwood concentrations took place during and after events that are celebrated with bonfires. These were Guy Fawkes events in the urban areas and on New Year's Day at the rural sites; the later probably related to long-range transport. Time series were built using the RF. Having removed weather influences, long-term trends of Cwood were estimated using the Theil Sen method. Trends for 2015Â2021 were downward at three of the locations (London, Glasgow and rural Scotland), with rates ranging from ?5.5% year?1 to ?2.5% year?1. The replacement of old fireplaces with lower emission wood stoves might explain the decrease in Cwood especially at the urban sites The two rural sites in England observed positive trends for the same period but this was not statistically significant.

The intercorrelation between multiple pollutant components and the extremely volatile PM pattern changes are the key impediments to effective prediction. For accurate PM forecasting with the benefit of federated learning, a new architecture incorporating seminal stacked long short-term memory networks (SS-LSTM) is presented in this research. The historical data are analyzed using SS-LSTM to reveal the location-aware behavior of PM, and a new prediction model is generated that takes into account the most prevalent pollutants and weather conditions. The stacking of LSTM units adds hierarchical levels of knowledge that help to tune the forecast model with the most appropriate weighting to the external features that contribute toward PM. The suggested SS-LSTM model is compared with traditional machine learning approaches and deep learning models to see how well it performs in predicting PM2.5 and PM10. The suggested strategy outperforms all other models tested in experiments carried out for the data collected from Delhi in India.

Owing to this, a lot of research and studies have been done to tackle this issue. However, most of the existing methodologies have several issues such as high cost, low deployment, maintenance capabilities and uni-or bi-variate concentration of air pollutants. In this paper, a hybrid CNN-LSTM model is presented to forecast multivariate air pollutant concentration for the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart city design. The amalgamation of CNN-LSTM acts as an encoder-decoder which improves the overall accuracy and precision. The performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM is compared with conventional and hybrid machine learning (ML) models on the basis of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Square Error (MSE). The proposed model outperforms various state-of-the-art ML models by generating an average MAE, MAPE and MSE of 54.80%, 52.78% and 60.02%. Furthermore, the predicted results are cross-validated with the actual concentration of air pollutants and the proposed model achieves a high degree of prediction accuracy to real-time air pollutants concentration. Moreover, a cross-grid cooperative scheme is proposed to tackle the IoT monitoring station malfunction scenario and make the pollutant monitoring more fault resistant and robust. The proposed scheme exploits the correlation between neighbouring monitoring stations and air pollutant concentration. The model generates an average MAPE and MSE of 10.90% and 12.02%, respectively.

Changes in biomass of mat-forming pale lichens have the potential to affect vegetation, fauna, climate and human activities including reindeer husbandry. Lichens have a complex spectral signature and terricolous lichens have limited growth height, often growing in mixtures with taller vegetation. This has, so far, prevented the development of remote sensing techniques to accurately assess lichen biomass, which would be a powerful tool in ecosystem and ecological research and rangeland management. We present a Landsat based remote sensing model developed using deep neural networks, trained with 8914 field records of lichen volume collected for &gt;20 years. In contrast to earlier proposed machine learning and regression methods for lichens, our model exploited the ability of neural networks to handle mixed spatial resolution input. We trained candidate models using input of 1 Ã 1 (30 Ã 30 m) and 3 Ã 3 Landsat pixels based on 7 reflective bands and 3 indices, combined with a 10 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. We normalised elevation data locally for each plot to remove the region-specific variation, while maintaining informative local variation in topography. The final model predicted lichen volume in an evaluation set (n = 159) reaching an R2 of 0.57. NDVI and elevation were the most important predictors, followed by the green band. Even with moderate tree cover density, the model was efficient, offering a considerable improvement compared to earlier methods based on specific reflectance. The model was in principle trained on data from Scandinavia, but when applied to sites in North America and Russia, the predictions of the model corresponded well with our visual interpretations of lichen abundance. We also accurately quantified a recent historic (35 years) change in lichen abundance in northern Norway. This new method enables further spatial and temporal studies of variation and changes in lichen biomass related to multiple research questions as well as rangeland management and economic and cultural ecosystem services. Combined with information on changes in drivers such as climate, land use and management, and air pollution, our model can be used to provide accurate estimates of ecosystem changes and to improve vegetation-climate models by including pale lichens.

The meteorological parameters were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) database. MATLAB scripts of code were used to develop the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The measured parameters were subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistics. The highest mean radon concentration was observed in offices built on granitic bedrock with a value of 64.3 Â± 1.7 Bq.m?3 while the lowest was observed in alluvium bedrock with a value of 52.5 Â± 1.4 Bq.m?3. To enhance prediction involving erratic parametric patterns, the measured data were subjected to an optimized Artificial Neural Network architecture training, validation, and testing, leading to a model determined to have a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient value of 0.997, Average Absolute Relative Error of 0.0115, and Mean Squared Error of 0.07. The predicted result was compared favorably with the measured data with 0.054 Average Validation Error, 0.027 Mean Absolute Error 3.64 Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and 83.7% Goodness-of-Prediction values.

Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the influence variables of the PM10 prediction model by using wrapper feature selection to compare the prediction model performance of different wrapper feature selection and to predict the concentration of PM10 for the next day. This research uses 10 years of daily data on pollutant concentrations from two stations (Klang and Shah Alam) obtained from the Department of Environment Malaysia (DOE) from 2009 until 2018. Six wrapper methods (forward selection, backward elimination, stepwise, brute-force, weight-guided and genetic algorithm evolution and the predictive analytics multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN)) were implemented in this study. This study found that brute-force is the dominant wrapper method in most of the best models in selecting important features for MLR. Moreover, compared to MLR, ANN provides more advantages regarding model accuracy and permits feature selection in predicting PM10. The overall results revealed that the RMSE value for next day prediction in Klang is 20.728, while the AE value is 15.69. Furthermore, the RMSE value for next day prediction in Shah Alam is 10.004, while the AE value is 7.982. Finally, all of the predicted models in Klang and Shah Alam can be used to predict the PM10 concentrations.

To eliminate its hazardous impacts, the development of an accurate and effective approach to forecast the upcoming pollution concentration levels is in urgent need. Recent studies show that machine learning algorithms have excellent abilities in ground-level ozone concentration forecasting, however many of their forecasting models do not consider the contributing effects on meteorological measurements and traffic situations which were also identified as potential influencing factors to ground-level ozone concentration by some previous research. In the meantime, most of the existing models target short-term forecasting with rough temporal resolutions, such as daily and weekly scales. This paper aims to propose a methodology that can provide long-term GLO concentration forecasting with a high temporal resolution. To achieve this, a frequent pattern mining approach is utilized to analyze the local intercorrelation between GLO concentration and contributing factors such as meteorological parameters and transportation situations. Then, a series of machine learning algorithms were identified to forecast the ground-level ozone concentration levels using traffic and meteorological measurements data. A case study was conducted in the Houston region with 10 years of historical measurements, each of the historical ground-level ozone concentration records is associated with a series of meteorology and traffic situation parameters. Data from 2010 to 2019 was used to select and train the machine learning models, and data from 2020 was used to perform the final validation and evaluation. Results show that the extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm provides the most accurate prediction of the hourly ground-level ozone concentration on a yearly scale, which shows the annually forecasting ability and the robustness of the model built. The proposed approach could be applied to other similar regions and other critical air pollutants that are also influenced by transportation and meteorological factors.

Today, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are widely used for system modeling, prediction, control, and optimization in the energy sector. The internet of things (IoT) is the core of the third wave of the information industry revolution and AI. In the energy sector, tens of billions of IoT appliances are linked to the Internet, and these appliances generate massive amounts of data every day. Extracting useful information from the massive amount of data will be a very meaningful thing. Complex event processing (CEP) is a stream-based technique that can extract beneficial information from real-time data through pre-establishing pattern rules. The formulation of pattern rules requires strong domain expertise. Therefore, at present, the pattern rules of CEP still need to be manually formulated by domain experts. However, in the face of complex, massive amounts of IoT data, manually setting rules will be a very difficult task. To address the issue, this paper proposes a CEP rule auto-extraction framework by combining deep learning methods with data mining algorithms. The framework can automatically extract pattern rules from unlabeled air pollution data. The deep learning model we presented is a two-layer LSTM (long short-term memory) with an attention mechanism. The framework has two phases: in the first phase, the anomalous data is filtered out and labeled from the IoT data through the deep learning model we proposed, and then the pattern rules are mined from the labeled data through the decision tree data mining algorithm in the second phase. We compare other deep learning models to evaluate the feasibility of the framework. In addition, in the rule extraction stage, we use a decision tree data mining algorithm, which can achieve high accuracy. Experiments have shown that the framework we proposed can effectively extract meaningful and accurate CEP rules. The research work in this paper will help support the advancement of the sector of air pollution prediction, assist in the establishment of air pollution regulatory strategies, and further contribute to the development of a green energy structure.

This paper presents the largest such study conducted in a single urban area. Using samples that were collected at 220 locations over two seasons, quasi-ultrafine (PM0.2), accumulation mode fine (PM0.2-2.5), and coarse (PM2.5-10) particulate matter concentrations were used to develop spatiotemporal regression, machine learning models that enabled predictions of 24 elemental components in eight Southern California communities. We used supervised variable selection of over 150 variables, largely from publicly available sources, including meteorological, roadway and traffic characteristics, land use, and dispersion model estimates of traffic emissions. PM components that have high oxidative potential (and potentially large health effects) or are otherwise important markers for major PM sources were the primary focus. We present results for copper, iron, and zinc (as non-tailpipe vehicle emissions); elemental carbon (diesel emissions); vanadium (ship emissions); calcium (soil dust); and sodium (sea salt). Spatiotemporal linear regression models with 17 to 36 predictor variables including meteorology; distance to different classifications of roads; intersections and off ramps within a given buffer distance; truck and vehicle traffic volumes; and near-roadway dispersion model estimates produced superior predictions over the machine learning approaches (cross validation R-squares ranged from 0.76 to 0.92). Our models are easily interpretable and appear to have more effectively captured spatial gradients in the metallic portion of PM than other comparably large studies, particularly near roadways for the non-tailpipe emissions.

Land-use/land cover information which is easier to obtain could represent as surrogates of emission sources for assessing indoor air quality. Moreover, low-cost sensors and machine learning provide a better way to enhance model accuracy. Objectives: This study proposed an alternative estimation approach to assess daily PM2.5 concentration for indoor environments of schools in a large area by integrating low-cost sensors, land-use/land cover predictors, and machine learning-based modelling approaches. Methods: Indoor PM2.5 data was collected from 145 indoor AirBox sensors in Kaohsiung and Pingtung Counties of Taiwan. Geospatial predictors were extracted from the circular buffers surrounding each AirBox sensor. Spearman correlation analysis and stepwise variable selection procedures were performed to select variables for land-use regression (LUR) and integrated with XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and LGBM machine learning models. Results: The results revealed that outdoor PM2.5 and distance to the nearest thermal power plant were the main determinants of indoor estimation variations, when there were no indoor sources. When incorporating machine learning, the R2 increased from 0.59 for LUR to 0.85 for LUR-XGBoost while the RMSE decreased from 8.63 to 5.27 ?g/m3, which performed better than both LUR-RF and LUR-LGBM. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the value of the proposed alternative approach by incorporating data from a low-cost sensor with LUR model and machine learning algorithm in estimating the spatiotemporal variability of indoor PM2.5 for a large area.

The training datasets were generated from numerical simulations by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-Markov chain model. An inverse method based on Tikhonov regularization was then used to estimate the emission profile. Finally, the Markov chain model was used to calculate the air pollutant distribution in the whole street canyon. Case studies were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. For the unit impulse source in the 2-D ventilated chamber of 27 m2, the source in 83% of the cases were accurately identified, and in another 13% of the cases, the identified source was within 0.4 m to the true location.

For effective environmental management, this study aims to compare the performance of two classification algorithms in machine learning (logistic regression and naive bayes) and to evaluate the selection of the best algorithm for predicting the air quality class. Materials and methods: Pollutants data (PM10, SO2, NO2) have been collected from the Haldwani, Kashipur and Rudrapur regions in Uttarakhand (India). In part I of the study, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is calculated and assigned a class accordingly. In part II, the performance of algorithms is compared, and the air quality class is predicted through the best algorithm. In part III, accuracy is calculated after comparing the predicted class with the actual class. Then, it is compared with the accuracy of our selected algorithm. Results: The study finds a positive correlation between PM10 and SO2 pollutants. The result shows that the highest accuracy is achieved through logistic regression to predict the air quality class. Further, logistic regression has achieved the same accuracy i.e., 98.70% after comparing predicted values with the actual values. Conclusion: Logistic regression is the best algorithm to predict the air quality class in the regions of Uttarakhand, where pollutants are being measured in the GovernmentÂs hospital. The research also indicates that asthma patients in the Kashipur and Rudrapur regions may experience more health effects due to moderately polluted air quality; however, the situation is improving during the monsoon season.

Urban air quality maps are traditionally derived using measurements from fixed monitoring stations. Due to high cost, these stations are generally sparsely deployed in a few representative locations, leading to a highly generalized air quality map. In addition, urban air quality varies rapidly over short distances (&lt;1 km) and is influenced by meteorological conditions, road network and traffic flow. These variations are not well represented in coarse-grained air quality maps generated by conventional fixed-site monitoring methods but have important implications for characterizing heterogeneous personal air pollution exposures and identifying localized air pollution hotspots. Therefore, fine-grained urban air quality mapping is indispensable. In this context, supplementary low-cost mobile sensors make mobile air quality monitoring a promising alternative. Using sparse air quality measurements collected by mobile sensors and various contextual factors, especially traffic flow, we propose a context-aware locally adapted deep forest (CLADF) model to infer the distribution of NO2 by 100 m and 1 h resolution for fine-grained air quality mapping. The CLADF model exploits deep forest to construct a local model for each cluster consisting of nearest neighbor measurements in contextual feature space, and considers traffic flow as an important contextual feature. Extensive validation experiments were conducted using mobile NO2 measurements collected by 17 postal vans equipped with low-cost sensors operating in Antwerp, Belgium. The experimental results demonstrate that the CLADF model achieves the lowest RMSE as well as advances in accuracy and correlation, compared with various benchmark models, including random forest, deep forest, extreme gradient boosting and support vector regression.

As a consequence, a low-emission scenario that could only be simulated before, actually occurred. This constituted a unique and valuable opportunity to study the effect of air quality pollutant concentrations. Although a direct comparison between the observed measured values given by reference air quality stations (AQSs) and values from before the COVID lockdown provides an idea of the pollution reduction, it cannot be separated from the meteorology, and hence, those studies could be misleading. This study used the approach of modeling a normal business day using both air quality and meteorological data from 2017 to 2019 to train machine-learning models to be able to predict what concentration of the three most concerning pollutants (NO2, O3, and PM10) would be given by the meteorological conditions and the time of the year. The XGBoost and LightGBM gradient boosting decision tree-based models were applied to the time series recorded in Madrid and used to predict the expected concentrations in 2020 if no restrictions had been made. The predictions could then be compared to the real observed AQS data to determine the meteorological normalized reductions. The results showed around a 60% reduction in the NO2 at the three types of AQSs (traffic, suburban, and background) during the most restrictive months of the pandemic. The O3 concentration showed a different behavior depending on the type of AQS, pointing to changes in the regime of other pollutants, such as VOCs. The PM10 was the most difficult case to analyze because of its dependence on external transport phenomena, which were difficult to consider in the models. A set of CTM simulations should be done in the future to assess the O3-VOCs-NOx chemistry.

Accordingly, it is emerging as an urgent task to predict the charging demand for the smooth supply of electric energy required to charge electric vehicle batteries. In this paper, to predict the charging demand, time series analysis is performed based on two types of frames: One is using traditional time series techniques such as dynamic harmonic regression, seasonal and trend decomposition using Loess, and Bayesian structural time series. The other is the most widely used machine learning techniques, including random forest and extreme gradient boosting. However, the tree-based machine learning approaches have the disadvantage of not being able to capture the trend, so a hybrid strategy is proposed to overcome this problem. In addition, the seasonal variation is reflected as the feature by using the Fourier transform which is useful in the case of describing the seasonality patterns of time series data with multiple seasonality. The considered time series models are compared and evaluated through various accuracy measures. The experimental results show that the machine learning approach based on the hybrid strategy generally achieves significant improvements in predicting the charging demand. Moreover, when compared with the original machine learning method, the prediction based on the proposed hybrid strategy is more accurate than that based on the original machine learning method. Based on these results, it can find out that the proposed hybrid strategy is useful for smoothly planning future power supply and demand and efficiently managing electricity grids.

To enhance the performances of IAQ screening models using surrogate parameters in identi-fying unsatisfactory IAQ, and to update the screening models such that they can apply to a new standard, a novel framework for the updating of screening levels, using machine learning methods, is proposed in this study. The classification models employed are Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF) and sig-moid), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN). With carefully selected model hyperparameters, the IAQ assessment made by the models achieved a mean test accuracy of 0.536Â 0.805 and a maximum test accuracy of 0.807Â0.820, indicating that machine learning models are suitable for screening the unsatisfactory IAQ. Further to that, using the updated IAQ standard in Hong Kong as an example, the update of an IAQ screening model against a new IAQ standard was conducted by determining the relative impact ratio of the updated standard to the old standard. Relative impact ratios of 1.1Â1.5 were estimated and the corresponding likelihood ratios in the updated scheme were found to be higher than expected due to the tightening of exposure levels in the updated scheme. The presented framework shows the feasibility of updating a machine learning IAQ model when a new standard is being adopted, which shall provide an ultimate method for IAQ assessment prediction that is compatible with all IAQ standards and exposure criteria.

The fields developed differ considerably among these methods. The reasons for these differences and comparisons of their strengths, as well as the limitations for estimating exposures, remains under-investigated. Here, we applied nine methods to develop fields of eight pollutants (carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and three speciated PM2.5 constituents including elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), and sulfate (SO4)) for the metropolitan Atlanta region for five years. The nine methods are Central Monitor (CM), Site Average (SA), Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Kriging (KRIG), Land Use Regression (LUR), satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), CMAQ model, CMAQ with kriging adjustment (CMAQ-KRIG), and CMAQ based data fusion (CMAQ-DF). Additionally, we applied an increasingly popular method, Random Forest (RF), and compared its results for NO2 and PM2.5 with other methods. For statistical evaluation, we focused our discussion on the temporal coefficient of determination, although other metrics are also calculated. Raw output from the CMAQ model contains modeling biases and errors, which are partially mitigated by fusing observational data in the CMAQ-KRIG and CMAQ-DF methods. Based on analyses that simulated model responses to more limited input data, the RF model is more robust and outperforms LUR for PM2.5. These results suggest RF may have potential in air pollution health studies, especially when limited measurement data are available. The RF method has several important weaknesses, including a relatively poor performance for NO2, diagnostic challenges, and computational intensiveness. The results of this study will help to improve our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different methods for estimating air pollutant exposures in epidemiological studies.

Air pollution, especially PM2.5 resulting from industrialization, has fostered a wave of global weather migration and jeopardized human health in the past three decades. Taiwan has evolved as a highly developed economy and has a severe PM2.5 pollution problem. Thus, the control of PM2.5 is a critical issue for regulators, practitioners and academics. More recently, GA-SVM, an artificial-intelligence-based approach, has become a preferred prediction model, attributed to the advances in computer technology. However, hourly observation of PM2.5 concentration tends to present the GARCH effect. The objective of this study is to explore whether the integration of GA-SVM with the GARCH model can build a more accurate air pollution prediction model. The study adopts central Taiwan, the region with the worst level of PM2.5, as the source of observations. The empirical implementation of this study took a two-step approach; first, we examined the potential existence of the GARCH effect on the observed PM2.5 data. Second, we built a GA-SVM model integrated with the GARCH framework to predict the 8 h PM2.5 concentration of the sample region. The empirical results indicate that the prediction performance of our proposed alternative model out-performed the traditional SVM and GA-SVM models in terms of both MAPE and RMSE. The find-ings in this study provide evidence to support our expectation that adopting the SVM-based approach model for PM2.5 prediction is appropriate, and that prediction performance can be improved by integrating the GARCH model. Moreover, consistent with our prior expectation, the evidence further supports that taking the GARCH effect into account in the GA-SVM model significantly improves the accuracy of prediction. To the knowledge of the authors, this study is the first to at-tempt to integrate the GARCH effect into the GA-SVM model in the prediction of PM2.5. In sum-mary, with regard to the development of sustainability for both regulators and practitioners, our results strongly encourage them to take the GARCH effect into consideration in air pollution prediction if a regression-based model is to be adopted. Furthermore, this study may shed light on the application of the GARCH model and SVM models in the air pollution prediction literature. Â© 2022 by the authors.

With the looming consequences of climate change, sustainability measures including quantifying the amount of air pollution during a construction project have become an important project objective in the construction industry. A major contributor to air pollution during construction projects is the use of heavy equipment. Therefore, efficient operation and management can substantially reduce a projectÂs carbon footprint and other environmental harms. Using unintrusive and indirect methods to predict on-road vehicle emissions has been a widely researched topic. Nevertheless, the same is not true in the case of construction equipment. This paper describes the development and deployment of a framework that uses machine learning (ML) methods to predict the level of emissions from heavy construction equipment. Data is collected via an Internet of Things (IoT) approach with accelerometer and gyroscope sensors as data collection nodes. The developed framework was validated using an excavator performing real-world construction work. A portable emission measurement system (PEMS) was used along with the inertial sensors to record the amount of CO, NOX, CO2, SO2, and CH4 pollution emitted by the equipment. Different ML algorithms were developed and compared to identify the best model to predict emission levels from inertial sensors data. The results show that Random Forest with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94, 0.91, and 0.94, and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of 4.25, 6.42, and 5.17 for CO, NOX, and CO2, respectively, was the best algorithm among different models evaluated in this study.

PM2.5 has been identified as one of the major pollutants emitted by vehicles and associated with cardiopulmonary and respiratory diseases. As routing has been suggested to reduce the exposures for cyclists, in this study, PM2.5 was monitored with low-cost sensors during commuting periods to develop models for identifying low exposure routes in three Asian cities: Taipei, Osaka, and Seoul. The models for mapping the PM2.5 in the cities were developed by employing the random forest algorithm in a two-stage modeling approach. The land use features to explain spatial variation of PM2.5 were obtained from the open-source land use database, OpenStreetMap. The total length of the monitoring routes ranged from 101.36 to 148.22 km and the average PM2.5 ranged from 13.51 to 15.40 ?g/mÂ³ among the cities. The two-stage models had the standard k-fold cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.93, 0.74, and 0.84 in Taipei, Osaka, and Seoul, respectively. To address spatial autocorrelation, a spatial cross-validation approach applying a distance restriction of 100 m between the model training and testing data was employed. The over-optimistic estimates on the predictions were thus prevented, showing model CV-R2 of 0.91, 0.67, and 0.78 respectively in Taipei, Osaka, and Seoul. The comparisons between the shortest-distance and lowest-exposure routes showed that the largest percentage of reduced averaged PM2.5 exposure could reach 32.1% with the distance increases by 37.8%. Given the findings in this study, routing behavior should be encouraged. With the daily commuting trips expanded, the cumulative effect may become significant on the chronic exposures over time. Therefore, a route planning tool for reducing the exposures shall be developed and promoted to the public.

Smart parking systems, with the ever-increasing number of vehicles, are among the important matters in smart cities. The reason for this is that the search for parking spaces that are already insufficient, brings along a serious cost, air pollution and stress issues. In this study, a new approach that attempts to forecast the parking lot occupancy rate in the short- and medium-term with its deep learning-based Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) model was proposed. Initially, data belonging to 607 carparks located in the city of Istanbul in Turkey, and weather data have been collected, and a multivariate time series data set has been created. In the second stage, to forecast the parking places that would be available in the short- and medium-term, the GRU model was used in the system proposed. To show the effectiveness of the model, the results obtained through the 27 different models were compared by means of the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which were some other sequence models. According to the experimental results made on the weather data obtained from ?SPARK dataset and AKOM, the our proposed GRU model achieves 99.11% accuracy gave the best results with 0.90 MAE, 2.35 MSE and 1.53 RMSE metric values. Experimental results obtained with various hyperparameters clearly demonstrate the success of the GRU deep learning model in prediction parking occupancy rates.

As a result, accurate prediction is critical in human health management and government decision-making for environmental management. In this study, three artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, namely group method of data handling neural network (GMDHNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and gradient boosting regression (GBR) tree, are used to predict the hourly concentration of PM2.5 over a Dorset station located in Canada. The investigation has been performed to quantify the effect of data length on the AI modeling performance. Accordingly, nine different ratios (50/50, 55/45, 60/40, 65/35, 70/30, 75/25, 80/20, 85/15, and 90/10) are employed to split the data into training and testing datasets for assessing the performance of applied models. The results showed that the data division significantly impacted the model's capacity, and the 60/40 ratio was found more suitable for developing predictive models. Furthermore, the results showed that the ELM model provides more precise predictions of PM2.5 concentrations than the other models. Also, a vital feature of the ELM model is its ability to adapt to the potential changes in training and testing data ratio. To summarize, the results reported in this study demonstrated an efficient method for selecting the optimal dataset ratios and the best AI model to predict properly which would be helpful in the design of an accurate model for solving different environmental issues.

Continuous real-time monitoring of lifestyle and environmental factors is implemented by integrating wearable devices, open environmental data, indoor air quality sensing devices, a location-based smartphone app, and an AI-assisted telecare platform. The AI-assisted telecare platform provided comprehensive insight into patients' clinical, lifestyle, and environmental data, and generated reliable predictions of future acute exacerbation events. All data from 1,667 patients were collected prospectively during a 24-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 386 abnormal episodes. Machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms were used to train modular chronic disease models. The modular chronic disease prediction models that have passed external validation include obesity, panic disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average accuracy of 88.46%, a sensitivity of 75.6%, a specificity of 93.0%, and an F1 score of 79.8%. Compared with previous studies, we establish an effective way to collect lifestyle, life trajectory, and symptom records, as well as environmental factors, and improve the performance of the prediction model by adding objective comprehensive data and feature selection. Our results also demonstrate that lifestyle and environmental factors are highly correlated with patient health and have the potential to predict future abnormal events better than using only questionnaire data. Furthermore, we have constructed a cost-effective model that needs only a few features to support the prediction task, which is helpful for deploying real-world modular prediction models.

However, like other deep learning models, the lack of explainability is becoming a major drawback for GNNs, especially in health-related applications such as air pollution estimation, where a model's predictions might directly affect humans' health and habits. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc explainability framework for GNN-based models. More concretely, we propose a novel topology-aware kernelised node selection method, which we apply over the graph structural and air pollution information. Thanks to the proposed model, we are able to effectively capture the graph topology and, for a certain graph node, infer its most relevant nodes. Additionally, we propose a novel topological node embedding for each node, capturing in a vector-shape the graph walks with respect to every other graph node. To prove the effectiveness of our explanation method, we include commonly employed evaluation metrics as well as fidelity, sparsity and contrastivity, and adapt them to evaluate explainability on a regression task. Extensive experiments on two real-world air pollution data sets demonstrate and visually show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper aims to investigate the effects traffic data set have on the performance of machine learning (ML) predictive models in AQ prediction. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this, the authors have set up an experiment with the control data set having only the AQ data set and meteorological (Met) data set, while the experimental data set is made up of the AQ data set, Met data set and traffic data set. Several ML models (such as extra trees regressor, eXtreme gradient boosting regressor, random forest regressor, K-neighbors regressor and two others) were trained, tested and compared on these individual combinations of data sets to predict the volume of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 in the atmosphere at various times of the day. Findings: The result obtained showed that various ML algorithms react differently to the traffic data set despite generally contributing to the performance improvement of all the ML algorithms considered in this study by at least 20% and an error reduction of at least 18.97%. Research limitations/implications: This research is limited in terms of the study area, and the result cannot be generalized outside of the UK as some of the inherent conditions may not be similar elsewhere. Additionally, only the ML algorithms commonly used in literature are considered in this research, therefore, leaving out a few other ML algorithms. Practical implications: This study reinforces the belief that the traffic data set has a significant effect on improving the performance of air pollution ML prediction models. Hence, there is an indication that ML algorithms behave differently when trained with a form of traffic data set in the development of an AQ prediction model. This implies that developers and researchers in AQ prediction need to identify the ML algorithms that behave in their best interest before implementation. Originality/value: The result of this study will enable researchers to focus more on algorithms of benefit when using traffic data sets in AQ prediction.

When it comes to climate sustainability, air pollution is a major challenge. Because of the distinctive nature, unpredictability, and great changeability in the reality of toxins and particulates, detecting air quality is a puzzling task. Simultaneously, the ability to predict or classify and monitor air quality is becoming increasingly important, particularly in urban areas, due to the well documented negative impact of air pollution on residentÂs health and the environment. To better comprehend the current condition of air quality, this research proposes predicting air pollution levels from real-time data. This study proposes the use of deep learning techniques to forecast air pollution levels. Layers, activation functions, and a number of epochs were used to create the suggested Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network based neural layer design. The use of proposed Deep Learning as a structure for high-accuracy air quality prediction is investigated in this research and obtained better accuracy of nearly 82% compared to earlier records.

The existence of aerosols could promote photosynthesis by increasing the ratio of diffuse to direct solar radiation; on the contrary, ozone (O3) could inhibit photosynthesis, as it is detrimental to leaf stomata. However, it is unknown whether these two opposite impacts worldwide cancel each other out. In the current mainstream methods, earth system models may show conflicts with in situ experimental results due to their relatively coarse resolution. In virtue of satellite remote sensing and a global eddy covariance (EC) network, we studied ten years of data to explore the impacts of aerosol and O3 on photosynthesis by fitting an explainable machine learning model. The impacts of aerosol on gross primary productivity (GPP) were positive in many cases, yet very weak. By means of the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to formaldehyde (HCHO) ratio, O3 was seen with positive impacts on photosynthesis under the NOx-sensitive regime, but the apparent positive impacts correlated with the plant phenology. Under the volatile organic compound (VOC)-sensitive regime, the impacts of O3 on GPP were not obvious, which was likely due to the prioritized depletion of O3 by NO2 and VOCs. The impacts of air pollutants depended on many factors and results varied case by case, but the overall net impacts were negative.

Near-infrared (NIR) spectral determination of the octane number is practical for the rapid determination of gasoline quality. In NIR, the calibration model must be optimized for the improvement of the accuracy using deep learning methodologies. In this work, an algorithmic architecture was constructed for the deep learning of hybrid optimization by the combination fractional derivative (FD) and partial least squares (PLS). The design of FD-PLS methodology refers to the joint optimization for the data pretreatment and the calibration modeling. The FD order was tunable from 0.1 to 2.0 to search for the optimal pretreatment. Calibration models were established and trained by screening the optimal parameter combination for the model. The experimental results show that the calibration model was most improved by the FD-PLS deep learning with a 1.3 derivative order and 7 informative latent variables. The optimal model performed better than using integer derivative orders. In conclusion, the hybrid parameter optimization for the FD-PLS deep learning architecture improved the NIR assessment to characterize gasoline quality with quantitative prediction of the octane number.

So, it becomes necessary to understand and guide household energy consumption behaviors. In this paper, a multi-level agent-based model was constructed to aggregate the macro-level energy consumption (such as regions) from the micro-level entities (such as devices), and deep learning models were conducted and embedded in to predict the household energy consumption behaviors with factors as inputs and behavior parameters as outputs, meanwhile an energy substitution mechanism was designed. A series of scenarios were simulated based on actual survey samples, and the results indicated the great potential of our proposed method in the household energy simulation. The simulation fit the actual statistics well in the validation step. Under scenario analysis, the whole coal-to-electricity conversion was deeply determined by low-income individuals, and the effect pattern of certain factor was distinct and could be enhanced by others, while the marginal utility changed non-linearly with peak point effected by income growth rate. It is inspired that the local economic and socio-demographic situations should be comprehensively considered to achieve a trade-off between costs and expected results of regional energy strategies. Our research proposes a novelty study framework to simulate the household energy consumption from the micro individual perspective, and it is a valuable attempt to understand and quantify complex household energy consumption behaviors.

However, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, mankind is attempting to tackle many challenges from currently unpredictable epidemics. Korean society has been exposed to various infectious diseases since the Korean War in 1950, and to overcome them, the six most serious cases in National Notifiable Infectious Diseases (NNIDs) category I were defined. Although most infectious diseases have been overcome, viral hepatitis A has been on the rise in Korean society since 2010. Therefore, in this paper, the prediction of viral hepatitis A, which is rapidly spreading in Korean society, was predicted by region using the deep learning technique and a publicly available dataset. For this study, we gathered information from five organizations based on the open data policy: Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), Korea Meteorological Agency (KMA), Public Open Data Portal, and Korea Environment Corporation (KECO). Patient information, water environment information, weather information, population information, and air pollution information were acquired and correlations were identified. Next, an epidemic outbreak prediction was performed using data preprocessing and 3D LSTM. The experimental results were compared with various machine learning methods through RMSE. In this paper, we attempted to predict regional epidemic outbreaks of hepatitis A by linking the open data environment with deep learning. It is expected that the experimental process and results will be used to present the importance and usefulness of establishing an open data environment. Â© 2021 by the authors.

The air pollution studies seek to understand how this pollutant affects the health system. Since prediction involves several variables, any disparity causes a disturbance in the overall system, increasing the difficulty of the modelsÂ development. Due to the complex nonlinear behavior of the problem and their influencing factors, Artificial Neural Networks are attractive approaches for solving estimations problems. This paper explores two neural network architectures denoted unorganized machines: the echo state networks and the extreme learning machines. Beyond the standard forms, models variations are also proposed: the regularization parameter (RP) to increase the generalization capability, and the Volterra filter to explore nonlinear patterns of the hidden layers. To evaluate the proposed modelsÂ performance for the hospital admissions estimation by respiratory diseases, three cities of SÃ£o Paulo state, Brazil: CubatÃ£o, Campinas and SÃ£o Paulo, are investigated. Numerical results show the standard modelsÂ superior performance for most scenarios.

As a result, some projects have emerged to monitor air quality through the implementation of low-cost Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, the type of technology and the sensorsÂ location have an impact on data quality, resulting in a considerable amount of missing data.

In contrary to decrease seen in primary pollutant species, many of the countries have experienced elevated ground-level ozone levels in this period. Air pollution forecast gains more importance to achieve air quality management and take measures against the risks under such extra-ordinary conditions. Statistical models are indispensable tools for predicting air pollution levels. Considering the complex photochemical reactions involved in tropospheric ozone formation, modeling this pollutant requires efficient non-linear approaches. In this study, deep learning methods were applied to forecast hourly ozone levels during pandemic lock-down for an industrialized region in Turkey.

Air pollution data for most regions of China have a close correlation with time and seasons and are affected by multidimensional factors such as meteorology and air quality. In contrast with classical peaks-over-threshold modeling approaches, we use a deep learning technique and three new dynamic conditional generalized Pareto distribution (DCP) models with weather and air quality factors for fitting the time-dependence of the air pollutant concentration and make statistical inferences about their application in air quality analysis. Specifically, in the proposed three DCP models, a dynamic autoregressive exponential function mechanism is applied for the time-varying scale parameter and tail index of the conditional generalized Pareto distribution, and a sufficiently high threshold is chosen using two threshold selection procedures. The probabilistic properties of the DCP model and the statistical properties of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are investigated, simulating and showing the stability and sensitivity of the MLE estimations. The three proposed models are applied to fit the PM2.5 time series in Beijing from 2015 to 2021. Real data are used to illustrate the advantages of the DCP, especially compared to the estimation volatility of GARCH and AIC or BIC criteria. The DCP model involving both the mixed weather and air quality factors performs better than the other two models with weather factors or air quality factors alone.

Many prediction methods have been proposed in recent years to improve the prediction accuracy. However, most of the existing methods either did not consider the spatial relationships between monitoring stations or overlooked the strength of the correlation. Excluding the spatial correlation or including too much weak spatial inputs could influence the modeling and reduce the prediction accuracy. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes a correlation filtered spatial-temporal long short-term memory (CFST-LSTM) model for air quality prediction. The model is designed based on the original LSTM model and is equipped with a spatial-temporal filter (STF) layer. This layer not only takes into account the spatial influence between stations, but also can extract highly correlated sequential data and drop weaker ones. To evaluate the proposed CFST-LSTM model, hourly PM2.5 concentration data of California are collected and preprocessed. Several experiments are conducted. The experimental results show that the CFST-LSTM model can effectively improve the prediction accuracy and has great generalization.

In this study, we used the recently developed RF aerosol classification model to detect and classify aerosols into four types: pure dust, dust-dominated aerosols, strongly absorbing aerosols, and non-absorbing aerosols. Aerosol optical and microphysical properties for each aerosol type detected by the RF model were found to be reasonably consistent with those for typical aerosol types. In Asian capital cities, pollution-sourced aerosols, especially non-absorbing aerosols, were found to predominate, although Asian cities also tend to be seasonally affected by natural dust aerosols, particularly in East Asia (MarchÂMay) and South Asia (MarchÂAugust). No specific seasonal effects on aerosol type were detected in Southeast Asia, where there was a predominance of non-absorbing aerosols. The aerosol types detected by the RF model were compared with those identified by other aerosol classification models.

In particular, the input characteristics might affect the output of a deep learning model. When predicting data that are measured with sensors in multiple locations, it is necessary to train a deep learning model with spatiotemporal characteristics of the data. Additionally, since not all of the data measured together result in increasing the accuracy of the deep learning model, we need to utilize the correlation characteristics between the data features. However, it is difficult to interpret the deep learning output, depending on the input characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze how the input characteristics affect prediction results to interpret deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a visualization system to analyze deep learning models with air pollution data. The proposed system visualizes the predictions according to the input characteristics. The input characteristics include space-time and data features, and we apply temporal prediction networks, including gated recurrent units (GRU), long short term memory (LSTM), and spatiotemporal prediction networks (convolutional LSTM) as deep learning models.

This unit was developed using the NodeMCU-32S microcontroller, PMS5003-G5 (particulate matter sensing module), and Ublox NEO-6M V2 (GPS positioning module). The sensing unit transmits data of the particulate matter concentration and coordinates of a polluted location to the backend server through 3G and 4G telecommunication networks for data collection. This system will complement the governmentÂs PM2.5 data acquisition system. Mobile monitoring stations meet the air pollution monitoring needs of some areas that require special observation. For example, an AIoT development system will be installed. At intersections with intensive traffic, it can be used as a reference for government transportation departments or environmental inspection departments for environmental quality monitoring or evacuation of traffic flow. Furthermore, the particulate matter distributions in three areas, namely Xinzhuang, Sanchong, and Luzhou Districts, which are all in New Taipei City of Taiwan, were estimated using machine learning models, the data of stationary monitoring stations, and the measurements of the mobile sensing system proposed in this study. Four types of learning models were trained, namely the decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and radial basis function neural network, and their prediction results were evaluated. The root mean square error was used as the performance indicator, and the learning results indicate that the random forest model outperforms the other models for both the training and testing sets. To examine the generalizability of the learning models, the models were verified in relation to data measured on three days: 15 February, 28 February, and 1 March 2019. A comparison between the model predicted and the measured data indicates that the random forest model provides the most stable and accurate prediction values and could clearly present the distribution of highly polluted areas. The results of these models are visualized in the form of maps by using a web application. The maps allow users to understand the distribution of polluted areas intuitively. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Studies have attempted to capture features of air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using land use regression models, but this method overlooks the multi-collinearity of factors, non-linear correlations between factors and air pollutants, and it fails to perform well when processing daily data. However, machine learning is a feasible approach for establishing persuasive intra-urban air pollution daily variation models. In this article, random forest is utilised to establish intra-urban PM2.5 and NO2 spatial-temporal variation models and is compared to the traditional land use regression method. Taking the city of Shanghai, China as the case area, 36 station-measured daily records in two and a half years of PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were collected. And over 80 different predictors associated with meteorological and geographical conditions, transportation, community population density, land use and points of interest are used to construct the land use regression and random forest models. Results from the two methods are compared and impacting factors identified. Explained variance (R2) is used to quantify and compare model performance. The final land use regression model explains 49.3% and 42.2% of the spatial variation in ambient PM2.5 and NO2, respectively, whereas the random forest model explains 78.1% and 60.5% of the variance. Regression mappings for unsampled sites on a grid pattern of 1 km Ã 1 km are also implemented. The random forest model is shown to perform much better than the land use regression model. In general, the findings suggest that the random forest approach offers a robust improvement in predicting performance compared to the land use regression model in estimating daily spatial variations in ambient PM2.5 and NO2.

On-road emission remote sensing (OERS), which can measure the emission of passing vehicles without interfering the normal driving, is an ideal means to identify the on-road high-emitting vehicles. Since the remote sensing measurements only reflect the instantaneous emission status, there is no doubt that OERS-output pollutant concentrations are related to the operation conditions and ambient environments at the measuring moment. Therefore, in order to identify on-road high-emitters effectively and accurately, a high-emitter identification model considering the relationship between OERS-output pollutant concentrations and their influence factors (such as passing speed, passing acceleration, wind speed, wind direction, temperature, etc.) should be established. In this paper, the way to establish the high-emitter identification model by machine learning is investigated. Because of the imbalanced distribution characteristic of emitter dataset, the weighted extreme learning machine is adopted as the identification model. Meanwhile, to enable an efficient establishment of the identification model, the active sampling that considers the dataset imbalance is introduced to select valuable samples to be labeled. The experimental results show that the high-emitter identification model establishment method based on weighted extreme learning machine can reduce the identification error for high-emitters significantly. Additionally, the active sampling can select valuable samples and improve the identification performance through the model update.

The monitoring process is composed of data collection, evaluation, and decision-making. Several important pollutants, such as SO2, CO, PM10, O3, NOx, H2S, location, and many others, have important effects on air quality. Air quality should be recorded and measured based on the total effect of pollutants that are collectively prescribed by a numerical value. In Canada, the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is used which is one numerical value based on the total effect of some concentrations. Therefore, evolution is required to consider the complex, ill-defined air pollutants, hence several naive and noble approaches are used to study AQHI. In this study, three approaches such as hybrid data-driven ANN, nonlinear autoregressive with external (exogenous) input (NARX) with a neural network, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference (ANFIS) approaches are used for estimating the air quality in an urban area (Jeddah city-industrial zone) for public health concerns. Over three years, 1771 data were collected for pollutants from 1 June 2016 until 30 September 2019. In this study, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) approach was employed as an optimization method for ANNs to solve the nonlinear least-squares problems. The NARX employed has a two-layer feed-forward ANN. On the other hand, the back-propagation multi-layer perceptron (BPMLP) algorithm was used with the steepest descent approach to reduce the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSEs were 4.42, 0.0578, and 5.64 for ANN, NARX, and ANFIS, respectively. Essentially, all RMSEs are very small. The outcomes of approaches were evaluated by fuzzy quality charts and compared statistically with the US-EPA air quality standards. Due to the effectiveness and robustness of artificial intelligent techniques, the publicÂs early warning will be possible for avoiding the harmful effects of pollution inside the urban areas, which may reduce respiratory and cardiovascular mortalities. Consequently, the stability of air quality models was correlated with the absolute air quality index. The findings showed notable performance of NARX with a neural network, ANN, and ANFIS-based AQHI model for high dimensional data assessment. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Combining physical methods and deep learning models to divide the pollution process of PM2.5 into effective multiple types is necessary to achieve a reliable prediction of the PM2.5 value. Therefore, a candlestick chart sample generator was designed to generate the candlestick chart from the online PM2.5 continuous monitoring data of the Guilin monitoring station site. After these generated candlestick charts were analyzed through the Gaussian diffusion model, it was found that the characteristics of the physical transmission process of PM2.5 pollutants can be re-flected. Based on a set three-day period, using the time linear convolution method, 2188 sets of candlestick chart data were obtained from the 2013Â2018 PM2.5 concentration data. There existed 16 categories generated by unsupervised classification that met the established classification judgment standards. After the statistical analysis, it was found that the accuracy rate of the change trend of these classifications reached 99.68% during the next period. Using the candlestick chart data as the training dataset, the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) model, an improved convolutional neural network model, was used for the classification. The experimental results showed that the overall accuracy (OA) value of the candlestick chart combination classification was 96.19%, and the Kappa co-efficient was 0.960. IN the VGG model, the overall accuracy was improved by 1.93%, on average, compared with the support vector machines (SVM), LeNet, and AlexNet models. According to the experimental results, using the VGG classification method to classify continuous pollution data in the form of candlestick charts can more comprehensively retain the characteristics of the physical pollution process and provide a classification basis for accurately predicting PM2.5 values.

Samples were obtained on different days of the week at three main locations in the Zaer Parking Garage. A novel wavelet-based random forest model (WRF) was trained to estimate BTEX concentrations by decomposing temperature, day of the week, sampling location, and relative humidity data with a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) function and subsequently inputted into the WRF model. The results suggested that the WRF model can reasonably estimate BTEX trends and variations based on high R2 values of 0.96, 0.95, and 0.98 for training, validation, and test data subsets, respectively. The carcinogenic (LTCR) and non-carcinogenic health risk (HI) assessment results indicated a definite carcinogenic risk of benzene (LTCR = 2.22 Ã 10?4) and high non-carcinogenic risk (HI = 4.51) of BTEX emissions. The results of this study point to the importance of BTEX accumulation in poorly ventilated areas and the utility of machine learning in forecasting air pollution in diverse airsheds such as parking garages.

Subsequently, the model is applied to forecast the trends of temporal and spatial changes in the form of probabilistic inference and to investigate the degree of impact incurred from individual influencing factors.

As China emerges from the impact of COVID-19 on national economic and industrial activities, it has become the site of a large-scale natural experiment to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on regional air quality. However, ground measurements of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) concentrations do not offer comprehensive spatial coverage, especially in suburban and rural regions. In this study, we developed a machine learning method with satellite aerosol remote sensing data, meteorological fields and land use parameters as major predictor variables to estimate spatiotemporally resolved daily PM2.5 concentrations in China. Our study period consists of a reference semester (1 November 2018-30 April 2019) and a pandemic semester (1 November 2019-30 April 2020), with six modeling months in each semester. Each period was then divided into subperiod 1 (November and December), subperiod 2 (January and February) and subperiod 3 (March and April). The reference semester model obtained a 10-fold cross-validated R2 (RMSE) of 0.79 (17.55 Âµg/m3) and the pandemic semester model obtained a 10-fold cross-validated R2 (RMSE) of 0.83 (13.48 Âµg/m3) for daily PM2.5 predictions. Our prediction results showed high PM2.5 concentrations in the North China Plain, Yangtze River Delta, Sichuan Basin and Xinjiang Autonomous Region during the reference semester. PM2.5 levels were lowered by 4.8 Âµg/m3 during the pandemic semester compared to the reference semester and PM2.5 levels during subperiod 2 decreased most, by 18%. The southeast region was affected most by the COVID-19 outbreak with PM2.5 levels during subperiod 2 decreasing by 31%, followed by the Northern Yangtze River Delta (29%) and Pearl River Delta (24%).

However, the ability to conduct epidemiological assessments can be limited due to challenges in generating reliable PM2.5 estimates, particularly in parts of the world such as the Middle East where measurements are scarce and extreme meteorological events such as sandstorms are frequent. In order to supplement exposure modeling efforts under such conditions, satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) has proven to be useful due to its global coverage. By using AODs from the Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) of the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) combined with meteorological and assimilated aerosol information from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), we constructed machine learning models to predict PM2.5 in the area surrounding the Persian Gulf, including Kuwait, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E). Our models showed regional differences in predictive performance, with better results in the U.A.E. (median test R2 = 0.66) than Kuwait (median test R2 = 0.51). Variable importance also differed by region, where satellite-retrieved AOD variables were more important for predicting PM2.5 in Kuwait than in the U.A.E. Divergent trends in the temporal and spatial autocorrelations of PM2.5 and AOD in the two regions offered possible explanations for differences in predictive performance and variable importance. In a test of model transferability, we found that models trained in one region and applied to another did not predict PM2.5 well, even if the transferred model had better performance. Overall the results of our study suggest that models developed over large geographic areas could generate PM2.5 estimates with greater uncertainty than could be obtained by taking a regional modeling approach. Furthermore, development of methods to better incorporate spatial and temporal autocorrelations in machine learning models warrants further examination. Â© 2021 by the authors.

A thick layer of smog blankets can be seen in Delhi, India in November, the primary season of stubble burning. PM2.5 can play a major role in analyzing the stubble burning, as it has a better living time in the air. Numerous machine-learning techniques have been adopted to forecast the air quality, but none of them focuses primarily on the issues of stubble burning and its effect on DelhiÂs air. In this paper, the author attempts to estimate the value of PM2.5 in Delhi, mainly due to stubble burning in neighboring states. For this, the PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and SO2 data is taken into consideration for 9 ground-based continuous air quality monitoring stations in the neighboring states of Delhi for the duration of 6Â months and 15Â days in the calendar year of 2019. Subsequently various meteorological parameters are considered like wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity. The model used here is based on collaborative learning (stacking regression) which is trained using the out-of-folds predictions based on the complete training set, later the meta-regression is trained based on the outputs of the different regression methods in the group. The presented model is validated using different machine-learning methods, statistical measures, and the real-time stubble data of Delhi. The results show that the proposed method performs well when compared with previous methods.

Nevertheless, the relationship between AOD and ground-level PM2.5 varies spatiotemporally and differences related to spatial domains, temporal schemes, and seasonal variations must be assessed. Here, an ensemble multiple linear regression (EMLR) model and an ensemble neural network (ENN) model were developed to estimate PM2.5 levels in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA), the second largest urban center in Mexico. Four AOD-SDSs (Scientific Datasets) from MODIS Collection 6 were tested using three spatial domains and two temporal schemes. The best model performance was obtained using AOD at 0.55 Âµm from MODIS-Aqua at a spatial resolution of 3 km, along meteorological parameters and daily scheme. EMLR yielded a correlation coefficient (R) of ~0.57 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of ~7.00 Âµg m?3 . ENN performed better than EMLR, with an R of ~0.78 and RMSE of ~5.43 Âµg m?3 .

Several previous studies have been assessed the short-term and/or long-term effect of air pollutants on different diseases. An important sign of increasing the number of new people suffering from a disease or worsening the disease among the persons is increasing the hospitalization rate due to the disease. Increasing the incidence rate or severity of mental disorders which leads to patient hospitalization due to these types of diseases have negative impacts on the socio-economic aspects on the affected countries. Therefore, predicting the hospitalization rate due to mental disorders in advance may be helpful for health institutions to be prepared for dealing with these situations. Thus, the main aim of this study is proposing a novel stacked ensemble of Deep Convolutional neural network model and long short-term memory model (SEDCMLM) to predict the number of hospitalizations due to psychological disorders from the air pollutants and weather condition descriptors. This study considers all mental disorders included in International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). Previous studies have shown that weather descriptors are highly correlated with air pollution. Therefore, we consider both of them as input variables in this study. Input variables include air pollutant indices and weather condition descriptors gathered in range of March 21, 2014 to 1/18/2017 from Tehran Air Quality Control Company (AQCC) and Meteorological Organization of Iran, respectively. The experimental results show that SEDCMLM outperforms the compared models for psychological hospitalization prediction and it leads to desirable performance with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.62, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.48 and Mean R2 of 0.91. The short-term effect of air pollution on the number of admissions due to mental disorders are investigated for 1 to 10 previous days. It is shown that the best performance of the prediction models is obtained while considering data of 2Â4 previous days. Moreover, considering air pollutants, weather descriptors and the number of psychological hospitalization in the previous days can lead to the best performance for predicting the number of psychological patient admissions in the current day. According to the experimental results, air pollutants are good predictors for number of patient admissions due to mental disorders per day Therefore, it is recommended to use policies for reducing the level of air pollutants.

Predicting the least air polluted healthier path is the best alternative way to mitigate personal air pollution exposure risk. Computing the least polluted path for the current time might not be helpful for real-time applications. Therefore, we develop a routing algorithm based on a neural network-based CNN-LSTM-EBK (CLE), a temporal-spatial interpolation model. The proposed model predicts pollution levels at high temporal granularity. This paper introduces a weight function to compute air pollution concentration at the road network. It also predicts the least air polluted path among all possible paths from a source to a destination at different time granularity. The results show that the predicted path may be longer than the shortest route but minimize pollution exposure risk all the time, which proves its effectiveness during daily transportation. Â© 2021.

Solar irradiance is determined by deterministic factors (i.e. the position of the sun) and stochastic factors (i.e. the presence of clouds). Since the stochastic element is difficult to model, this problem can benefit from machine learning techniques, like artificial neural networks. This work proposes a methodology to forecast GHI in short- (i.e. from 15 min to 60 min) and mid-term (i.e. from 60 to 120 min) time horizons. For this purpose, we designed, optimised and compared four neural network architectures for time-series forecasting, respectively based on: i) Non-Linear Autoregressive, ii) Feed-Forward, iii) Long Short-Term Memory and iv) Echo State Network. The original data-set, consisting of GHI values sampled every 15min, has been pre-processed by applying different filtering techniques. Our results analysis compares the performance of the proposed neural networks identifying the best in terms of error rate and forecast horizon. This analysis highlights that the clear-sky index results the preferred filtering technique by giving greatly improvements in data-set pre-processing, and Echo State Network gives best accuracy results.

The models were trained using the data collected by the OpenSense project, in particular, number of particulate matter, particle diameter, and lung deposited surface area (LDSA). We examined two different sets of attributes: one based on a geographical description of the location under analysis (e.g. distribution of households and roads), and another based on a time series of past air pollution observations in that location. Overall, we have found out that past measures lead to better pollution predictions. The best R2 score was 0.751 obtained with the model that predicts LDSA and was trained with the data set with time series attributes, while the worst R2 was 0.009 obtained with the geographical data set to predict number of particles.

In this study, we investigate deep learning architectures to create a metamodel of the process oriented CTM CHIMERE and significantly reduce the computing times required for super-resolution simulations. The key point is the selection of input variables and the way to implement them in the NN. We perform a quantitative evaluation of the proposed approaches on a real case-study. The best NN architecture displays very good performances in terms of prediction of pollutant concentrations observed at stations with respect to the raw super-resolution CHIMERE simulation, with a correlation coefficient above 0.95. The best NN is also able to display better performances when compared to observations than the raw high resolution simulation.

Based on the data-driven mechanism, this paper proposes a deep learning method coupled with Bayesian optimization based on wavelet decomposition to model the time series data and forecasting its trend. Firstly, the data is decomposed by wavelet transform to reduce the complexity of the time series data. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network is trained as a submodel for each decomposition component. The hyperparameters of wavelet decomposition and each submodel are optimized with Bayesian sequence model-based optimization (SMBO) to develop the modeling accuracy. Finally, the results of all submodels are added to obtain forecasting results. The PM2.5 data collected by the US Air Quality Monitoring Station is used for experiments.

Therefore, a multi-scale deep learning (MDL) and optimal combination ensemble (OCE) approach for hourly air quality index (AQI) forecasting is proposed in this paper, named MDL-OCE model. Before normal modeling, all original data are preprocessed through missing data filling and outlier testing to ensure smooth computation. Due to the complexity of such big data, slope-based ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is adopted to decompose the time series of AQI and meteorological conditions into a finite number of simple intrinsic mode function (IMF) components and one residue component. Then, to unify the number of components of different variables, the fine-to-coarse (FC) technique is used to reconstruct all components into high frequency component (HF), low frequency component (LF), and trend component (TC). For purpose of extracting the underlying relationship between AQI and meteorological conditions, the three components are respectively trained and predicted by different deep learning architectures (stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE)) with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The corresponding forecasting results of three components are merged by OCE method to better achieve the ultimate AQI forecasting outputs. The empirical results clearly demonstrate that our proposed MDL-OCE model outperforms other advanced benchmark models in terms of forecasting performances in all cases. Â© 2021 - IOS Press.

Due to the limitations of missing values in aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, the reconstruction of full-coverage PM2.5 concentration remains challenging. In this study, we present a two-stage daily adaptive modeling framework, based on machine learning, to solve this problem. We built the annual models in the first stage, then daily models were constructed in the second stage based on the output of the annual models, which incorporated the parameter and feature adaptive tuning strategy. Within this study, PM2.5 concentrations were adaptively modeled and reconstructed daily based on the multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) AOD products and other ancillary data, such as meteorological factors, population, and elevation. Our model validation showed excellent performance with an overall R2 = 0.91 and RMSE = 9.91 ?g/m3 for the daily models, along with the site-based cross-validation R2s and RMSEs of 0.86Â0.87 and 12Â12.33 ?g/m3; these results indicated the reliability and feasibility of the proposed approach. The daily full-coverage PM2.5 concentrations at 1 km resolution across China during the Three-Year Blue-Sky Action Plan were reconstructed in this study. We analyzed the distribution and variations of reconstructed PM2.5 at three different time scales. Overall, national PM2.5 pollution has significantly improved with the annual average concentration dropping from 33.67Â28.03 ?g/m3, which demonstrated that air pollution control policies are effective and beneficial.

However, they are often given at coarse frequencies (ÂsnapshotÂ, daily or even longer), limiting their applications in epidemiological studies and assessing the evolution of NO2 pollution. This study investigated the potential applicability of Himawari-8 derived hourly fine particulate matter concentrations in producing hourly NO2 concentrations by constructing a space-time ensemble model. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, one of the serious pollution regions in China, is the study region chosen. The proposed model performs well in estimating hourly NO2 concentration with a high cross-validation (CV) coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.81) and low CV root-mean-square (RMSE = 9.71 ?g/m3), mean prediction errors (MPE = 6.33 ?g/m3), and relative prediction errors (RPE = 22.5%). On daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales, CV R2 increases to 0.89, 0.93, 0.97, and 0.99, respectively. The annual mean model estimated NO2 concentration over BTH region is 28.2 Â± 6.5 ?g/m3, with relatively higher NO2 concentrations are seen in southern and southeastern BTH. Winter experiences the most severe NO2 concentrations, followed by autumn, spring, and summer. Surface NO2 concentrations are higher (lower) in the morning (afternoon) and tend to decrease gradually with time. The model generally captures the hourly evolution of NO2 concentrations for the severe pollution episode but shows some underestimations. The annual mean NO2 concentrations were 2.8% lower on the weekend than on weekdays. In addition, the weekend effects of NO2 concentrations are larger at rush hour and lower in the noon. The hourly NO2 products derived from proposed approach are potentially useful for improving our understanding of the source, evolution, and transportation behavior of NO2 pollution episodes and for exposure- and health-related research. The proposed approach also enriches the potential applications of geostationary satellites (e.g., Himawari-8).

Current deterministic models rely on numerical simulation and the tuning of parameters, and empirical models present powerful learning ability but have not fully considered the temporal periodicity of air pollutants. In order to take the periodicity of pollutants into empirical air quality forecasting models, this study evaluates the temporal variations of air pollutants and develops a novel sequence to sequence model with weekly periodicity to forecast air quality. Two-year observation data from Shanghai roadside air quality monitoring stations are employed to support analyzing and modeling. The results conclude that the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations show obvious daily and weekly variations, and the temporal patterns are nearly consistent with the periodicity of traffic flow in Shanghai. Compared with PM2.5, the CO concentrations are more affected by traffic variation. The proposed model outperforms the baseline model in terms of accuracy, and presents a higher linear consistency in PM2.5 prediction and lower errors in CO prediction. This study could assist environmental researchers to further improve the technologies for urban air quality forecasting, and serve as tools for supporting policymakers to implement related traffic management and emission control policies.

Initially, a RF model of the pollutant is built and analysed in relation to the meteorological variables. This model is then corrected through subsequent modelling of its residuals using the univariate ARIMA.

However, these products generally have coarse resolutions, limiting the ability to evaluate PM2.5 concentrations in urban regions where the human activities are relatively high. This study first develops an ensemble machine learning approach to produce PM2.5 concentrations with an extremely high spatial resolution of 250 m, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements of top-of-atmosphere reflectance and related meteorological variables. The Yangtze River Delta region, with one of the highest levels of PM2.5 pollution in China, is the study region chosen. The model shows a very high and stable performance with a coefficient of determination ( R2) of 0.90, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 12.0?g/m3, a mean prediction error (MPE) of 7.8?g/m3, and a mean relative prediction error (RPE) 16.9% for sample-based cross validation. The model can accurately capture the distribution patterns and magnitudes of PM2.5 concentrations over the study region for seasonal mean, daily variations, and different levels of air pollution. The very high resolution of the model has the advantage of capturing the uneven spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations at small spatial scales and identifying small areas with very high PM2.5 concentrations, offering a possible approach for locating the sources of PM2.5 emissions. In general, the model developed here estimates very well PM2.5 concentrations at a very high spatial resolution, providing detailed information, useful for air-pollution-related studies, as well as pollution monitoring and evaluation by governments, especially in urban and urban-center areas.

This article points out that they are non-significantly negatively associated in other regression models, once omitted confounders (such as latitude and longitude) are included. More importantly, positive regression coefficients can and do arise when (generalized) linear regression models are applied to data with strong nonlinearities, including data on PM2.5, population density, and COVID-19 mortality rates, due to model specification errors. In general, statistical modeling accompanied by judgments about causal interpretations of statistical associations and regression coefficients Â the current weight-of-evidence (WoE) approach favored in much current regulatory risk analysis for air pollutants Â is not a valid basis for determining whether or to what extent risk of harm to human health would be reduced by reducing exposure.

The success of these deep learning models heavily depends on the two key factors viz. proper representation of the input data and preservation of temporal order of the input data during the featureÂs extraction phase. Here we propose a hybrid deep neural network (HDNN) framework to forecast the PM2.5 by integrating two popular deep learning architectures, viz. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BDLSTM) network. Here we build a 3D input tensor so that CNN can extract the trends and spatial features more accurately within the input window. Here we also introduce a linking layer between CNN and BDLSTM to maintain the temporal ordering of feature vectors. In the end, our proposed HDNN framework is compared with the state-of-the-art models, and we show that HDNN outruns other models in terms of prediction accuracy.

It is critical to analyze, forecast, and mitigate PM2.5 concentrations. One of the typical meteorological phenomena seducing PM2.5 concentrations to accumulate is temperature inversion which forms a warm-air cap to blockade the surface pollutants from dissipating. This paper analyzes the meteorological patterns which coincide with temperature inversion and proposes two machine learning classifiers for temperature inversion classification. A separate multivariate regression model is trained for the class with or without manifesting temperature inversion phenomena, in order to improve PM2.5 forecasting performance.

In this study, to expand these methods for time-series data, which are one of the most common data types in various real datasets, modified regularization methods are proposed for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based GANs. Specifically, the spectral normalization, hinge loss, orthogonal regularization, and the truncation trick are modified and assessed for LSTM-based GANs. Furthermore, a conditional GAN architecture called Controllable GAN (ControlGAN) is applied to LSTM-based GANs to produce the desired samples. The evaluations are conducted with sine wave data, air pollution datasets, and a medical time-series dataset obtained from intensive care units.

In this scenario, it is of paramount importance to monitor and predict PM concentration. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are commonly used to forecast air pollution levels due to their accuracy. The use of partition on prediction problems is well known because decomposition of time series allows the latent components of the original series to be revealed. It is a matter of extracting the ""deterministic"" component, which is easy to predict the random components. However, there is no evidence of its use in air pollution forecasting. In this work, we introduce a different approach consisting of the decomposition of the time series in contiguous monthly partitions, aiming to develop specialized predictors to solve the problem because air pollutant concentration has seasonal behavior. The goal is to reach prediction accuracy higher than those obtained by using the entire series. Experiments were performed for seven time series of daily particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5 and PM10-particles with diameter less than 2.5 and 10 micrometers, respectively) in Finland and Brazil, using four ANNs: multilayer perceptron, radial basis function, extreme learning machines, and echo state networks. The experimental results using three evaluation measures showed that the proposed methodology increased all models' prediction capability, leading to higher accuracy compared to the traditional approach, even for extremely high air pollution events. Our study has an important contribution to air quality prediction studies.

One of its main components, particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter of <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), can be inhaled and deposited in deeper regions of the respiratory system, causing adverse effects on human health, which are even more harmful to children. In this sense, the use of deterministic and stochastic models has become a key tool for predicting atmospheric behavior and, thus, providing information for decision makers to adopt preventive actions to mitigate air pollution impacts. However, stochastic models present their own strengths and weaknesses. To overcome some of disadvantages of deterministic models, there has been an increasing interest in the use of deep learning, due to its simpler implementation and its success on multiple tasks, including time series and air quality forecasting. Thus, the objective of the present study is to develop and evaluate the use of four different topologies of deep artificial neural networks (DNNs), analyzing the impact of feature augmentation in the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations by using five levels of discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The following types of deep neural networks were trained and tested on data collected from two living lab stations next to high-traffic roads in Guildford, UK: multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and a hybrid neural network composed of LSTM and 1D-CNN.

We showed the efficacy of the system through a case study of air pollution. The experimental results show that the modified LSTM autoencoder model shows the best performance compared to a generic LSTM model. We noticed that achieving the best performance requires optimizing many parameters, including learning rate, epoch, memory cell size, input timestep size, and the number of features/predictors.

While many such models exist, they often use manually constructed features based on restricted, locally available data. Thus, they are typically hard to reproduce and challenging to adapt to areas beyond those they have been developed for. In this article, we advocate a paradigm shift for LUR models: We propose the Data-driven, Open, Global (DOG) paradigm that entails models based on purely data-driven approaches using only openly and globally available data. Progress within this paradigm will alleviate the need for experts to adapt models to the local characteristics of the available data sources and thus facilitate the generalizability of air pollution models to new areas on a global scale. To illustrate the feasibility of the DOG paradigm for LUR, we introduce a deep-learning model called MapLUR. It is based on a convolutional neural network architecture and is trained exclusively on globally and openly available map data without requiring manual feature engineering. We compare our model to state-of-the-art baselines like linear regression, random forests and multi-layer perceptrons using a large data set of modeled NO2 concentrations in Central London. Our results show that MapLUR significantly outperforms these approaches even though they are provided with manually tailored features. Furthermore, we illustrate that the automatic feature extraction inherent to models based on the DOG paradigm can learn features that are readily interpretable and closely resemble those commonly used in traditional LUR approaches.

Accurate prediction of air pollutant concentrations is considered the key to air pollution warning and management. In this paper, a novel PM2.5 concentration prediction model, CBAM-CNN-Bi LSTM, is constructed by deep learning techniques based on the principles related to spatial big data. This model consists of the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the bi-directional long short-term memory neural network (Bi LSTM). CBAM is applied to the extraction of feature relationships between pollutant data and meteorological data and assists in deeply obtaining the spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 concentrations. As the output layer, Bi LSTM obtains the variation pattern of PM2.5 concentrations from spatial data, overcomes the problem of long-term dependence on PM2.5 concentrations, and achieves the task of accurately forecasting PM2.5 concentrations at multiple sites. Based on real datasets, we perform an experimental evaluation and the results show that, in comparison to other models, CBAM-CNN-Bi LSTM improves the accuracy of PM2.5 concentration prediction.

However, due to non-random missing and nighttime gaps in AOD products, obtaining spatiotemporally continuous hourly data with high accuracy has been a great challenge. Therefore, this study developed an automatic geo-intelligent stacking (autogeoi-stacking) model, which contained seven sub-models of machine learning and was stacked through a Catboost model. The autogeoi-stacking model used the automated feature engineering (autofeat) method to identify spatiotemporal characteristics of multi-source datasets and generate extra features through automatic non-linear changes of multiple original features. The 10-fold cross-validation (CV) evaluation was employed to evaluate the 24-hour and continuous ground-level PM2.5 estimations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during 2018. The results showed that the autogeoi-stacking model performed well in the study area with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.88, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of 17.38 Âµg/m3, and the mean absolute error (MAE) of 10.71 Âµg/m3. The estimated PM2.5 concentrations had an excellent performance during the day (8:00Â18:00, local time) and night (19:00Â07:00) (the cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2): 0.90, 0.88), and captured hourly PM2.5 variations well, even in the severe ambient air pollution event. On the seasonal scale, the R2 values from high to low were winter, autumn, spring, and summer, respectively. Compared with the original stacking model, the improvement of R2 with the autofeat and hyperparameter optimization approaches was up to 5.33%. In addition, the annual mean values indicated that the southern areas, such as Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, and Handan, suffered higher PM2.5 concentrations. The northern regions (e.g., Zhangjiakou and Chengde) experienced low PM2.5. In summary, the proposed method in this paper performed well and could provide ideas for constructing geoi-features and spatiotemporally continuous inversion products of PM2.5.

The current study sought to use machine learning (ML) prediction based on past patient for conjunctivitis and several air pollutants. The optimal machine learning prediction model was selected to predict conjunctivitis-related number patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The average daily air pollutants concentrations (CO, O3, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5) and weather data (highest and lowest temperature) were collected. Data were randomly divided into training dataset and test dataset, and normalized mean square error (NMSE) was calculated by 10 fold cross validation, comparing between the ability of seven ML methods to predict the number of patients due to conjunctivitis (Lasso penalized linear model, Decision tree, Boosting regression, Bagging regression, Random forest, Support vector, and Neural network). According to the accuracy of impact prediction, the important air and weather factors that affect conjunctivitis were identified. RESULTS: A total of 84,977 cases to treat conjunctivitis were obtained from the ophthalmology center of the Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University. For all patients together, the NMSE of the different methods were as follows: Lasso penalized linear regression: 0.755, Decision tree: 0.710, Boosting regression: 0.616, Bagging regression: 0.615, Random forest: 0.392, Support vectors: 0.688, and Neural network: 0.476. Further analyses, stratified by gender and age at diagnosis, supported Random forest as being superior to others ML methods. The main factors affecting conjunctivitis were: O3, NO2, SO2 and air temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithm can predict the number of patients due to conjunctivitis, among which, the Random forest algorithm had the highest accuracy. Machine learning algorithm could provide accurate information for hospitals dealing with conjunctivitis caused by air factors. Â© 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

Air quality monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. The high cost of the acquisition and maintenance of accurate air quality stations implies that only a small number of these stations can be deployed in a country. To improve the spatial resolution of the air monitoring process, an interesting idea is to develop data-driven models to predict air quality based on readily available data. In this paper, we investigate the correlations between air pollutants concentrations and meteorological and road traffic data. Using machine learning, regression models are developed to predict pollutants concentration. Both linear and non-linear models are investigated in this paper. It is shown that non-linear models, namely Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), better describe the impact of traffic flows and meteorology on the concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere. It is also shown that more accurate prediction models can be obtained when including some pollutants' concentration as predictors. This may be used to infer the concentrations of some pollutants using those of other pollutants, thereby reducing the number of air pollution sensors. Â© 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

The satellite-based top-down method can provide near-real-time constraints on emissions; however, its efficiency is largely limited by efforts in dealing with the complex emission-concentration response. Here, we propose a novel machine-learning-based method using a physically informed variational autoencoder (VAE) emission predictor to infer NOxemissions from satellite-retrieved surface NO2concentrations. The computational burden can be significantly reduced with the help of a neural network trained with a chemical transport model, allowing the VAE emission predictor to provide a timely estimation of posterior emissions based on the satellite-retrieved surface NO2concentration. The VAE emission predictor successfully corrected the underestimation of NOxemissions in rural areas and the overestimation in urban areas, resulting in smaller normalized mean biases (reduced from -0.8 to -0.4) and larger R2values (increased from 0.4 to 0.7). The interpretability of the VAE emission predictor was investigated using sensitivity analysis by modulating each feature, indicating that NO2concentration and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height are important for estimating NOxemissions, which is consistent with our common knowledge. The advantages of the VAE emission predictor in efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy demonstrate its great potential in estimating the latest emissions and evaluating the control effectiveness from observations.

This paper proposes a new deep learning model called temporal difference-based graph transformer networks (TDGTN) to learn long-term temporal dependencies and complex relationships from time series PM2.5 data for air quality PM2.5 prediction. The proposed TDGTN comprises of encoder and decoder layers associated with the developed graph attention mechanism. In particular, considering the similarity of different time moments and the importance of temporal difference between two adjacent moments for air quality PM2.5prediction, we first construct graph-structured data from original time series PM2.5 data at different moments without explicit graph structure. Then we improve the self-attention mechanism with the temporal difference information, and develop a new graph attention mechanism. Finally, the developed graph attention mechanism is embedded into the encoder and decoder layers of the proposed TDGTN to learn long-term temporal dependencies and complex relationships from a graph prospective on air quality PM2.5 prediction tasks. Experiment results on two collected real-world datasets in China, such as Beijing and Taizhou PM2.5 datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms other used methods on both short-term and long-term air quality PM2.5 prediction tasks.

However, the effects of meteorological factors, which significantly affect the dispersion of air pollution, on the urban-form-air-quality relationship have not been understood on a granular level. We attempt to fill this gap by developing predictive models of particulate matter (PM) in the Bronx (New York City) using meteorological and urban form parameters. The granular PM data was collected by mobile low-cost sensors as the ground truth. To evaluate the effects of meteorological factors, we compared the performance of models using the urban form within fixed and wind-sensitive buffers, respectively. We find better predictive power in the wind-sensitive group (R = 0.85) for NC10(number concentration for particles with diameters of 1 ?m-10 ?m) than the control group (R = 0.01), and modest improvements for PM2.5(R = 0.84 for the wind sensitive group, R = 0.77 for the control group), indicating that incorporating meteorological factors improved the predictive power of our models. We also found that urban form factors account for 62.95% of feature importance for NC10and 14.90% for PM2.5(9.99% and 4.91% for 3-D and 2-D urban form factors, respectively) in our Random Forest models. It suggests the importance of incorporating urban form factors, especially for the uncommonly used 3-D characteristics, in estimating intraurban PM. Our method can be applied in other cities to better capture the influence of urban context on PM levels. Â© 2022 American Chemical Society.

However, the existing satellite and ground observation methods are not enough to effectively monitor the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of near-surface NO2 concentrations, which limits the development of pollutant remediation work and medical health research. Based on TROPOMI-NO2 tropospheric column concentration data, supplemented by meteorological data, atmospheric condition reanalysis data and other geographic parameters, combined with classic machine learning models and deep learning networks, we constructed an ensemble model that achieved a daily average near-surface NO2 of 0.03Â° exposure. In this article, a meteorological hysteretic effects term and a spatiotemporal term were designed, which considera-bly improved the performance of the model. Overall, our ensemble model performed better, with a 10-fold CV R2 of 0.89, an RMSE of 5.62 Âµg/m3, and an MAE of 4.04 Âµg/m3. The model also had good temporal and spatial generalization capability, with a temporal prediction R2 and a spatial prediction R2 of 0.71 and 0.81, respectively, which can be applied to a wider range of time and space. Finally, we used an ensemble model to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of NO2 in a coastal region of southeastern China from May 2018 to December 2020. Compared with satellite observa-tions, the model output results showed richer details of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of NO2 concentrations. Due to the advantages of using multi-source data, this model framework has the potential to output products with a higher spatial resolution and can provide a reference for downscaling work on other pollutants.

Furthermore, with the development of industry and technology, rapid population growth, and the massive expansion of cities, the total amount of pollution emissions continue to increase. Hence, observing and predicting the air quality index (AQI), which measures fatal pollutants to humans, has become more and more critical in recent years. However, there are insufficient air quality monitoring stations for AQI observation because the construction and maintenance costs are too high. In addition, finding an available and suitable place for monitoring stations in cities with high population density is difficult. This study proposes a spatial-temporal model to predict the long-term AQI in a city without monitoring stations. Our model calculates the spatial-temporal correlation between station and region using an attention mechanism and leverages the distance information between all existing monitoring stations and target regions to enhance the effectiveness of the attention structure. Furthermore, we design a hybrid predictor that can effectively combine the time-dependent and time-independent predictors using the dynamic weighted sum. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms all the baseline models. In addition, the ablation study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed structures.

Moreover, the use of satellite aerosol optical depth data has been a key predictor especially for particulate matter pollution and when studying large populations. Within the STEAM project we present a hybrid spatio-temporal modeling framework by a) incorporating predictions from dispersion modeling of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal or less than 10?m (PM10) and less than 2.5?m (PM2.5) into a spatio-temporal LUR model; and b) combining the predictions LUR and dispersion modeling and additionally, only for PM2.5, from an ensemble machine learning approach using a generalized additive model (GAM). We used air pollution measurements from 2009 to 2013 from 62 fixed monitoring sites for O3, 115 for particles and up to 130 for NO2, obtained from the dense network in the Greater London Area, UK. We assessed all models following a 10-fold cross validation (10-fold CV) procedure. The hybrid models performed better compared to separate LUR models. Incorporation of the dispersion estimates in the LUR models as a predictor, improved the LUR model fit: CV-R2 increased to 0.76 from 0.71 for NO2, to 0.79 from 0.57 for PM10, to 0.81 to 0.66 for PM2.5 and to 0.75 from 0.62 for O3. The CV-R2 obtained from the hybrid GAM framework was also increased compared to separate LUR models (CV-R2 = 0.80 for NO2, 0.76 for PM10, 0.79 for PM2.5 and 0.75 for O3).

Reliable evaluation of changes in pollutants due to altered emissions requires considering meteorological and other variability influencing concentrations. Here, a combination of ensemble learning, competitive learning and unsupervised clustering is proposed and applied to leverage the change analysis of particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms Random Forest (RF) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) were trained with historical meteorological data, pollutant concentrations and traffic indicators. The importance of different variables for local PM2.5 was determined with RF. SOM was configured for multivariable cluster analysis. The trained SOM enabled predicting a cluster for new data representing conditions with shifted anthropogenic activity. The prediction forms a benchmark for the analysed period with maximized meteorological similarity, which facilitates identifying changes in ambient pollutants due to changed emissions. The method was applied to data from the start of COVID-19 pandemic, 3/2020, when emissions suddenly decreased. For measurements from Helsinki, Finland, the SOM yielded a statistically significant change in PM2.5 (?0.7%), NO2 (?33%) and O3 (+17%). Comparing data from 3/2020 to data from 3/2017Â2019 produced different results (PM2.5 ?1.7%, NO2 ?37%, O3 ?4.0%). Statistical indicators confirmed better compatibility between the analysed period and its benchmark when using the SOM prediction instead of calendar-based selection: Average RMSRE was 19%-points lower and Willmott's dr 41% higher with SOM than with 3/2017Â2019.

Influenza vaccination plays an important role in protecting against influenza-induced severe diseases. However, no study to date has focused on whether influenza vaccination may modify the associations between ambient air pollution exposure and lung function. Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional study of 6740 children aged 7-14 years into Seven Northeast Cities (SNEC) Study in China during 2012-2013. We collected information from parents/guardians about sociodemographic factors and influenza vaccination status in the past three years. Lung function was measured using portable electronic spirometers. Machine learning methods were used to predict 4-year average ambient air pollutant exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 1 mu m (PM1), < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and < 10 mu m (PM10). Two-level linear and logistic regression models were used to assess interactions between influenza vaccination and long-term ambient air pollutants exposure on lung function reduction, controlling for potential confounding factors. Results: Ambient air pollution were observed significantly associated with reductions in lung function among children. We found significant interactions between influenza vaccination and air pollutants on lung function, suggesting greater vulnerability to air pollution among unvaccinated children. For example, an interaction (p(interaction) = 0.002) indicated a - 283.44 mL (95% CI: - 327.04, - 239.83) reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PK_ concentrations among unvaccinated children, compared with the -108.24 mL (95%CI: - 174.88, - 41.60) reduction in FVC observed among vaccinated children. Results from logistic regression models also showed stronger associations between per IQR increase in PM1 and lung function reduction measured by FVC and peak expiratory flow (PEF) among unvaccinated children than the according ORs among vaccinated children [i.e., Odds Ratio (OR) for PM1 and impaired FVC: 2.33 (95%CI: 1.79, 3.03) vs 1.65 (95%CI: 1.20, 2.28); OR for PM2.5 and impaired PEF: 1.45 (95%CI: 1.12,1.87) vs 1.04 (95%CI: 0.76,1.43)]. The heterogeneity of the modification by influenza vaccination of the associations between air pollution exposure and lung function reduction appeared to be more substantial in girls than in boys. Conclusion: Our results suggest that influenza vaccination may moderate the detrimental effects of ambient air pollution on lung function among children. This study provides new insights into the possible co-benefits of strengthening and promoting global influenza vaccination programs among children.",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109624,8,2,No,,,,"Peoples R China,Australia,United States,Germany,Finland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II) module is a common monitoring tool used to acquire sensing data from in-vehicle electronic control units. However, different vehicle models use different controller area network (CAN) standards, resulting in communication difficulties; however, relevant literature has not discussed compatibility problems. The present study researched and developed the universal OBD-II module, adopted deep learning methods to evaluate fuel consumption, and proposed an intuitive driving graphic user interface design. In addition to using the universal module to obtain data on different CAN standards, this study used deep learning methods to analyze the fuel consumption of three vehicles of different brands on various road conditions. The accuracy was over 96%, thus validating the practicability of the developed system. This system will greatly benefit future applications that employ OBD-II to collect various types of driving data from different car models.

Specifically, fine-granular air quality (AQ) inference provides fundamental progress toward data-driven urban management, as it estimates grid-level pollutant concentrations constantly using pollutant measurement data collected from fixed and mobile sensors. In this paper, we propose a tree-based multicascade space-time learning model (MCST-Tree) for AQ inference to recover pollution maps by exploiting multisource AQ samples (fixed and mobile) and heterogeneous urban feature sets (land-use, meteorology, population, traffic, etc.). This is implemented and evaluated in a study case of Chengdu (4900 km2, 14 June to 14 July 2018), which achieves map-recovery of PM2.5 distribution based upon the sparse measurements (ca. 16.2% space-time coverage) with high-performance (symmetric mean average percentage error (SMAPE) (%) = 14.13%; R2 = 0.94). Detailed evaluations are presented through the analysis of model performance, space-time coverage of mobile sampling, and AQ inference. We conduct a series of sensitivity analyses of mobile sampling coverage, and the experimental results show that it is a critical issue to enhance the model trust, which contributes to improve the R-square from 0.81 (fixed data + 10% mobile data) to 0.94 (fixed data + 100% mobile data). The results show that the mobile sampling significantly improves the space-time modeling capability, and our proposed model has great potential to achieve map-recovery for air pollution at high spatial-temporal resolution with high performance.

Accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration can help the government to effectively reduce the damage caused by haze events. The prediction of PM2.5 concentration using deep learning models has gradually become a research hotspot. For predicting PM2.5 concentration considering the non-Euclidean distribution characteristics of air quality monitoring stations and the time-series characteristics of pollutant concentration data, a hybrid model combining multi-graph convolution and Long Short-Term Memory network (MGC-LSTM) was proposed in this study, based on the six pollutant concentration data of CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2. Two different methods are used in the study to construct adjacency matrices to build multiple graphs composed of stations, and then, the two matrices were fused into a new graph. We use the adjacency matrix of the new graph and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to extract spatial features of the input data, and then transfer the results of GCN into Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) to obtain the predicted values of PM2.5 concentration.

In this work, the novel optimised DL algorithms are proposed for the efficient prediction of air quality particularly focussing on Chennai, Tamil Nadu. To provide higher accuracy in air quality prediction, the novel optimised DL algorithms are proposed which is combined several models like ARIMA and CNN-LSTM and Tuna Optimization Algorithm, respectively. Initially, CNN and LSTM are combined to provide hybrid architecture. Next, the metaheuristics-based tuna swarm optimization model is applied for fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the CNN-LSTM model which is known as the Tuna Optimised CNN-LSTM (TOCL) method. Finally, the novel TOCL is applied to the residuals of the ARIMA model to form an ARIMA- TOCL (ARTOCL) model. As a result, the novel ARTOCL is learned and performed with an optimal air quality prediction. The metrics of the Hybrid ARTOCL model are evaluated as a better mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R2 score and the normalized RMSE (nRMSE) with higher accuracy than the previous models.

Among women with BMI >= 30 kg/m(2), we observed weak inverse associations with PCOM for the second (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.33) and third tertiles (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.57). Conclusions In this study of reproductive-aged women, we observed little association between PM2.5 concentrations and PCOM incidence. No dose response relationships were observed nor were estimates appreciably different across race/ethnicity within this clinically sourced cohort.",ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,10.1186/s12940-022-00835-1,4,2,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, satellite observations since 2009 indicate total column NO2 is no longer declining even as bottom-up inventories suggest continued decline in emissions. Multiple explanations have been proposed for this discrepancy including (a) the increasing relative importance of nonurban NOx to total column NO2, (b) differences between background and urban NOx lifetimes, and (c) that the actual NOx emissions are declining more slowly after 2009. Here, we use a deep learning model trained by NOx emissions and surface observations of ozone to assess consistency between the reported NOx trends between 2005 and 2014 and observations of surface ozone. We find that the satellite-derived trends best reproduce ozone in low NOx emission (background) regions. The 2010-2014 trend from older satellite-derived emission estimates produced at low spatial resolution results in the largest bias in surface ozone in regions with high NOx emissions, reflecting the blending of urban and background NOx in these low-resolution top-down analyses. In contrast, the trend from higher resolution satellite-based estimates, which are more capable of capturing the urban emission signature, is in better agreement with ozone in high NOx emission regions, and is consistent with the trend based on surface observations of NO2. Our results confirm that the satellite-derived trends reflect anthropogenic and background influences. Plain Language Summary Air pollution regulations have led to significant reductions in NOx emissions in the US in the past two decades. However, satellite-based analyses have suggested a slow-down in the reduction of US NOx emissions after 2010. Here, we use a deep learning model to evaluate NOx emission trends in the US. We find that the satellite-based trends are consistent with trends in surface NO2 observations in high NOx emission regions, but in rural regions the satellite-based trends reflect the influence of changes in background and anthropogenic NOx emissions.",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,10.1029/2021jd035597,4,2,No,,,,"Canada,United States,Peoples R China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, PM2.5 exposure remains high, ozone (O-3) exposure is increasing, and the public health impacts are substantial. We used emulators to explore how emission changes (averaged per sector over all species) have contributed to changes in air quality and public health in China over 2010-2020. We show that PM2.5 exposure peaked in 2012 at 52.8 mu g m(-3), with contributions of 31% from industry and 22% from residential emissions. In 2020, PM2.5 exposure declined by 36% to 33.5 mu g m(-3), where the contributions from industry and residential sources reduced to 15% and 17%, respectively. The PM2.5 disease burden decreased by only 9% over 2012 where the contributions from industry and residential sources reduced to 15% and 17%, respectively 2020, partly due to an aging population with greater susceptibility to air pollution. Most of the reduction in PM2.5 exposure and associated public health benefits occurred due to reductions in industrial (58%) and residential (29%) emissions. Reducing national PM2.5 exposure below the World Health Organization Interim Target 2 (25 mu g m(-3)) would require a further 80% reduction in residential and industrial emissions, highlighting the challenges that remain to improve air quality in China. Plain Language Summary Atmospheric models are useful to simulate air quality, weather, and climate, and to explore processes and mechanisms in detail. However, they are computationally expensive due to their complexity. This limits the experiments that are feasible. One solution to this problem is to use emulators. Emulators are machine learning models that are trained with atmospheric model simulations. They are cheaper to run, enabling much more experimentation. Here, we used emulators to predict air quality and health in China from emission changes (averaged per sector over all species). The emulators accurately predicted the spatial variation and magnitude of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations across China. We found that PM2.5 exposure peaked in 2012 at 52.8 mu g m(-3). For comparison, this is ten times larger than the WHO Air Quality Guideline. The main contributors to these air pollution levels in 2012 were industrial (31%) and residential (22%) emissions. Over 2012-2020, PM2.5 exposure reduced by 36%, attaining the National Air Quality Target of 35 mu g m(-3). This air quality improvement avoided 187,800 premature deaths each year by 2020. Most of these health benefits were due to lower industrial (58%) and residential (29%) emissions.

While their use continues to spread across the field of atmospheric chemistry, the air quality monitoring community, and for commercial and private use, challenges remain in ensuring data quality and comparability of calibration methods. This study introduces a seven-step methodology for the field calibration of low-cost sensor systems using reference instrumentation with user-friendly guidelines, open-access code, and a discussion of common barriers to such an approach. The methodology has been developed and is applicable for gas-phase pollutants, such as for the measurement of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or ozone (O-3). A full example of the application of this methodology to a case study in an urban environment using both multiple linear regression (MLR) and the random forest (RF) machine-learning technique is presented with relevant R code provided, including error estimation. In this case, we have applied it to the calibration of metal oxide gas-phase sensors (MOSs). Results reiterate previous findings that MLR and RF are similarly accurate, though with differing limitations. The methodology presented here goes a step further than most studies by including explicit transparent steps for addressing model selection, validation, and tuning, as well as addressing the common issues of autocorrelation and multicollinearity. We also highlight the need for standardized reporting of methods for data cleaning and flagging, model selection and tuning, and model metrics. In the absence of a standardized methodology for the calibration of low-cost sensor systems, we suggest a number of best practices for future studies using low-cost sensor systems to ensure greater comparability of research.",ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES,10.5194/amt-14-7221-2021,6,2,No,,,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this concern, we used automated, machine-learning, high-dimensional data pruning, and validated identified biomarkers. The parent cohort consisted of male, never-smoking firefighters with WTC-LI (FEV1, %Pred< lower limit of normal (LLN); n = 100) and controls (n = 127) and had their biomarkers assessed. Cases and controls (n = 15/group) underwent untargeted metabolomics, then feature selection performed on metabolites, cytokines, chemokines, and clinical data.

Random forests of metabolites (n = 580), clinical biomarkers (n = 5), and previously assayed cytokines, chemokines (n = 106) identified that the top 5% of biomarkers important to class separation included pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), macrophage derived chemokine (MDC), systolic blood pressure, macrophage inflammatory protein-4 (MIP-4), growth-regulated oncogene protein (GRO), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), apolipoprotein-AII (Apo-AII), cell membrane metabolites (sphingolipids, phospholipids), and branched-chain amino acids. Validated models via confounder-adjusted (age on 9/11, BMI, exposure, and pre-9/11 FEV1, %Pred) binary logistic regression had AUC(ROC) [0.90(0.84-0.96)]. Decreased PEDF and MIP-4, and increased Apo-AII were associated with increased odds of WTC-LI. Increased GRO, MCP-1, and simultaneously decreased MDC were associated with decreased odds of WTC-LI. In conclusion, automated data pruning identified novel WTC-LI biomarkers; performance was validated in an independent cohort. One biomarker-PEDF, an antiangiogenic agent-is a novel, predictive biomarker of particulate-matter-related lung disease. Other biomarkers-GRO, MCP-1, MDC, MIP-4-reveal immune cell involvement in WTC-LI pathogenesis. Findings of our automated biomarker identification warrant further investigation into these potential pharmacotherapy targets. Author summary Disease related to air pollution causes millions of deaths annually. Large swathes of the general population, as well as certain occupations such as 1(st) responders and military personnel, are exposed to particulate matter (PM)-a major component of air pollution. Our longitudinal cohort of FDNY firefighters exposed to the World Trade Center dust cloud on 9/11 is a unique research opportunity to characterize the impact of a single, intense PM exposure by looking at pre- and post-exposure phenotype; however, PM-related lung disease and PM's systemic effects are complex and call for a systems biological approach coupled with novel computational modelling techniques to fully understand pathogenesis.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone and carbon monoxide using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively. The overall process was implemented with reference data coming from a certified air quality fixed station in the city of Cuenca - Ecuador. Experimental results showed that the real-time reports of ozone provided by the prototype are quite similar to the fixed station during the evaluation period, with a resulting correlation of up to in the calibration and evaluation set, respectively. However, signal drift and aging in sensors diminished the accuracy of carbon monoxide calibration models, resulting in lower correlation with the evaluation set.",IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/access.2020.2980736,8,2,No,,,,Mexico,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research has been realized with the application of different statistical parameters, synoptic meteorology tools, the Random Forests machine learning method, and multilinear regression analyses. Another aim of the research was to evaluate the types of atmospheric circulation classification methods used in studies on air pollution dispersion and to assess the possibility of their application in air quality management, including short-term PM10 daily forecasts. During the period analyzed, a significant decreasing trend of pollutants' concentrations and varying atmospheric circulation conditions was observed. To understand the relation between PM10 concentration and meteorological conditions and their significance, the Random Forests algorithm was applied. Observations from meteorological stations, air quality measurements and ERA-5 reanalysis were used. The meteorological database was used as an input to models that were trained to predict daily PM10 concentration and its day-to-day changes. This study made it possible to distinguish the dominant circulation types with the highest probability of occurrence of poor air quality or a significant improvement in air quality conditions. Apart from the parameters whose significant influence on air quality is well established (air temperature and wind speed at the ground and air temperature gradient), the key factor was also the gradient of relative air humidity and wind shear in the lowest troposphere. Partial dependence calculated with the use of the Random Forests model made it possible to better analyze the impact of individual meteorological parameters on the PM10 daily concentration. The analysis has shown that, for areas with a diversified topography, it is crucial to use the variability of the atmospheric circulation during the day to better forecast air quality.",SUSTAINABILITY,10.3390/su14063388,4,2,Yes,"LR,RF",,No,Poland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Predicting future air quality conditions is crucial for implementing pollution control measures and guiding residents' activity choices. However, traditional single-module machine learning models suffer from long training times and low prediction accuracy. To improve the accuracy of air quality forecasting, this paper proposes a ISSA–LSTM model-based approach for predicting the air quality index (AQI). The model consists of three main components: random forest (RF) and mRMR, improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA), and long short-term memory network (LSTM). Firstly, RF–mRMR is used to select the influential variables affecting AQI, thereby enhancing the model's performance. Next, ISSA algorithm is employed to optimize the hyperparameters of LSTM, further improving the model’s performance. Finally, LSTM model is utilized to predict AQI concentrations. Through comparative experiments, it is demonstrated that the ISSA–LSTM model outperforms other models in terms of RMSE and R2, exhibiting higher prediction accuracy. The model's predictive performance is validated across different time steps, demonstrating minimal prediction errors. Therefore, the ISSA–LSTM model is a viable and effective approach for accurately predicting AQI. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-023-39838-4,2,2,Yes,LSTM,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) in Random Forest,, improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA),,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to estimate trends in black carbon and PM2·5 concentrations and their attributable mortality burden across the USA. Methods: In this study, we derived daily concentrations of PM2·5 and its highly toxic black carbon component at a 1-km resolution in the USA from 2000 to 2020 via deep learning that integrated big data from satellites, models, and surface observations. We estimated the annual PM2·5-attributable and black carbon-attributable mortality burden at each 1-km2 grid using concentration–response functions collected from a national cohort study and a meta-analysis study, respectively. We investigated the spatiotemporal linear-regressed trends in PM2·5 and black carbon pollution and their associated premature deaths from 2000 to 2020, and the impact of wildfires on air quality and public health. Findings: Our results showed that PM2·5 and black carbon estimates are reliable, with sample-based cross-validated coefficients of determination of 0·82 and 0·80, respectively, for daily estimates (0·97 and 0·95 for monthly estimates). Both PM2·5 and black carbon in the USA showed significantly decreasing trends overall during 2000 to 2020 (22% decrease for PM2·5 and 11% decrease for black carbon), leading to a reduction of around 4200 premature deaths per year (95% CI 2960–5050). However, since 2010, the decreasing trends of fine particles and premature deaths have reversed to increase in the western USA (55% increase in PM2·5, 86% increase in black carbon, and increase of 670 premature deaths [460–810]), while remaining mostly unchanged in the eastern USA. The western USA showed large interannual fluctuations that were attributable to the increasing incidence of wildfires. Furthermore, the black carbon-to-PM2·5 mass ratio increased annually by 2·4% across the USA, mainly due to increasing wildfire emissions in the western USA and more rapid reductions of other components in the eastern USA, suggesting a potential increase in the relative toxicity of PM2·5. 100% of populated areas in the USA have experienced at least one day of PM2·5 pollution exceeding the daily air quality guideline level of 15 μg/m3 during 2000–2020, with 99% experiencing at least 7 days and 85% experiencing at least 30 days. The recent widespread wildfires have greatly increased the daily exposure risks in the western USA, and have also impacted the midwestern USA due to the long-range transport of smoke. Interpretation: Wildfires have become increasingly intensive and frequent in the western USA, resulting in a significant increase in smoke-related emissions in populated areas. This increase is likely to have contributed to a decline in air quality and an increase in attributable mortality. Reducing fire risk via effective policies besides mitigation of climate warming, such as wildfire prevention and management, forest restoration, and new revenue generation, could substantially improve air quality and public health in the coming decades.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of various emissions sources and meteorological factors on ozone formation in Houston from 2017 to 2021 using a comprehensive PMF-SHAP approach. First, we distinguished the unique sources of VOCs in each area and identified differences in the local chemistry that affect ozone production. At the urban station, the primary sources were n_decane, biogenic/industrial/fuel evaporation, oil and gas flaring/production, industrial emissions/evaporation, and ethylene/propylene/aromatics. At the industrial site, the main sources were industrial emissions/evaporation, fuel evaporation, vehicle-related sources, oil and gas flaring/production, biogenic, aromatic, and ethylene and propylene. And then, we performed SHAP analysis to determine the importance and impact of each emissions factor and meteorological variables. Shortwave radiation (SHAP values are ∼5.74 and ∼6.3 for Milby Park and Lynchburg, respectively) and humidity (∼4.87 and ∼4.71, respectively) were the most important variables for both sites. For the urban station, the most important emissions sources were n_decane (∼2.96), industrial emissions/evaporation (∼1.89), and ethylene/propylene/aromatics (∼1.57), while for the industrial site, they were oil and gas flaring/production (∼1.38), ethylene/propylene (∼1.26), and industrial emissions/evaporation (∼0.95). NOx had a negative impact on ozone production at the urban station due to the NOx-rich chemical regime, whereas NOx had positive impacts at the industrial site. The study's findings suggest that the PMF-SHAP approach is efficient, inexpensive, and can be applied to other similar applications to identify factors contributing to ozone-exceedance events. The study's results can be used to develop more effective air quality management strategies for Houston and other cities with high levels of ozone. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122223,2,2,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed an approach using machine learning that is accurate enough to generate a long time series of the nitrogen isotopic composition (δ15N) of atmospheric nitrate using high-level accuracies of air pollutants and meteorology data. Air temperature was found to be the critical driver of the variation of nitrate δ15N at daily resolution based on this approach, while significant reductions of aerosol and its precursor emissions played a key role in the change of nitrate δ15N on the yearly scale. Predictions from this model found a significant decrease in nitrate δ15N in Chinese megacities (Beijing and Guangzhou as representative cities in the north and south, respectively) since 2013, implying an enhanced contribution of nonfossil fuel NOx emissions to nitrate aerosols (up to 22%-26% in 2021 from 18%-22% in 2013 quantified by an isotope mixing model), as confirmed by the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with online chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulation. Meanwhile, the declining contribution in coal combustion (34%-39% in 2013 to 31%-34% in 2021) and increasing contribution of natural gas combustion (11%-14% in 2013 to 14%-17% in 2021) demonstrated the transformation of China’s energy structure from coal to natural gas. This approach provides missing records for exploring long-term variability in the nitrogen isotope system and may contribute to the study of the global reactive nitrogen biogeochemical cycle. © 2023 American Chemical Society",Environmental Science and Technology,10.1021/acs.est.3c01651,2,2,No,,,,"China,Hong Kong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to rapid industrialization and population growth, activities such as transportation, household, agricultural, and industrial processes contribute to air pollution. As a result, air pollution has become a significant problem in many cities, especially in emerging countries like India. To maintain ambient air quality, regular monitoring and forecasting of air pollution is necessary. For that purpose, machine learning has emerged as a promising technique for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) compared to conventional methods. Here we apply the AQI to the city of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India, focusing on 12 contaminants and 10 meteorological parameters from July 2017 to September 2022. For this purpose, we employed several machine learning models, including LightGBM, Random Forest, Catboost, Adaboost, and XGBoost. The results show that the Catboost model outperformed other models with an R2 correlation coefficient of 0.9998, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.60, a mean square error (MSE) of 0.58, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.76. The Adaboost model had the least effective prediction with an R2 correlation coefficient of 0.9753. In summary, machine learning is a promising technique for predicting AQI with Catboost being the best-performing model for AQI prediction.

This study develops a model that combines an attention mechanism, convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) unit to predict the O3 and PM2.5 levels in the atmosphere, as well as an air quality index (AQI). The prediction results given by the proposed model are compared with those from CNN-LSTM and LSTM models as well as random forest and support vector regression models. The proposed model achieves a correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed values of more than 0.90, outperforming the other four models. The model errors are also consistently lower when using the proposed approach. Sobol-based sensitivity analysis is applied to identify the variables that make the greatest contribution to the model prediction results. Taking the COVID-19 outbreak as the time boundary, we find some homology in the interactions among the pollutants and meteorological factors in the atmosphere during different periods. Solar irradiance is the most important factor for O3, CO is the most important factor for PM2.5, and particulate matter has the most significant effect on AQI. The key influencing factors are the same over the whole phase and before the COVID-19 outbreak, indicating that the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on AQI gradually stabilized.

While creating well-being for human society, greenhouses also bring negative impacts such as air pollution, soil pollution, and water pollution. Therefore, it is of great significance to obtain information such as the area and quantity of greenhouses. It is still a challenging task to find a low-cost, high-efficiency, and easy-to-use method for the dual extraction of greenhouse area and quantity on a large scale. In this study, relatively easy-to-obtain high-resolution Google Earth remote sensing images are used as the experimental data source, and an area and quantity simultaneous extraction framework (AQSEF) is constructed to extract both the area and quantity of greenhouses. The AQSEF uses UNet and YOLO v5 series networks as core operators to complete model training and prediction, and main components such as SWP, OSW&NMS and GCA complete data postprocessing. To evaluate the feasibility of our method, we take Beijing, China, as the research area and select multiple accuracy evaluation indicators in the two branches for accuracy verification. The results show that the mIoU, OA, Kappa, Recall and Precision with the best performance model in the area extraction branch can reach 0.931, 0.987, 0.867, 0.91 and 0.914, respectively.

Finally, in Beijing, the area covered by greenhouses is approximately 85.443 km2, and the quantity of greenhouses is approximately 155,464. With the proposed method, the time consumed for area extraction and quantity extraction is 6.73 h and 12.97 h, respectively.

Previous UFP estimates generally relied on land-use regression with insufficient temporal resolution. We carried out in-situ measurements for UFP in central Taiwan and developed a model incorporating satellite-based measurements, meteorological variables, and land-use data to estimate daily UFP levels at a 1-km resolution. Two sampling campaigns were conducted for measuring hourly UFP concentrations at six sites between 2008–2010 and 2017–2021, respectively, using scanning mobility particle sizers. Three machine learning algorithms, namely random forest, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural network, were used to develop UFP estimation models. The performances were evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation, temporal, and spatial validation. A total of 1,022 effective sampling days were conducted. The XGBoost model had the best performance with a training coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99 [normalized root mean square error (nRMSE): 6.52%] and a cross-validation R2 of 0.78 (nRMSE: 31.0%). The ten most important variables were surface pressure, distance to the nearest road, temperature, calendar year, day of the year, NO2, meridional wind, the total length of roads, PM2.5, and zonal wind. The UFP levels were elevated along the main roads across different seasons, suggesting that traffic emission is an important contributor to UFP. This hybrid model outperformed prior land use regression models and thus can provide more accurate estimates of UFP for epidemiological studies. © 2023 The Author(s)",Environment International,10.1016/j.envint.2023.107937,2,2,No,,,,"Taiwan,Japan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, most of the studies only provide air pollution forecasts on single or multiple sites, rather than citywide information. Due to complex urban structure and spatial transportation of air pollutants, the distribution of citywide air quality can be highly varying, which makes it extremely challenging to make accurate forecasts. Here, we address this challenge by exploring the potential of combining the dense air quality monitoring data with the deep learning technique. By using the fine-granular PM2.5 concentrations data collected from 417 micro monitoring stations in Lanzhou City, China, we proposed an end-to-end method to predict future citywide PM2.5 concentrations at 500 m × 500 m × 1 h resolution. This method consists of a spatio-temporal transformation component and a spatio-temporal prediction component, of which the former is responsible for converting PM2.5 concentration data into spatial-maps, while the spatio-temporal prediction network (i.e., Air-PredNet in our study) based on ConvLSTM in the latter is responsible for capturing the spatio-temporal characterizations in the spatial-map sequences and finally generating citywide air quality forecasts. The results show that our method can accurately predict the spatial distribution and variations of PM2.5 concentration with an RMSE of 2.12 μg/m3 for 1-h prediction and an RMSE of 4.09 μg/m3 for 6-h prediction. In addition, we also proved the robustness of Air-PredNet based on the prediction performance for O3 and NO2.

An accurate prediction of air pollution can provide a credible foundation for determining the social activities of individuals. Scholars have, thus, proposed a variety of models and techniques for predicting air pollution. However, most of these studies are focused on the prediction of individual pollution factors and perform poorly when multiple pollutants need to be predicted. This paper offers a DW-CAE model that may strike a balance between overall accuracy and local univariate prediction accuracy in order to observe the trend of air pollution more comprehensively. The model combines deep learning and signal processing techniques by employing discrete wavelet transform to obtain the high and low-frequency features of the target sequence, designing a feature extraction module to capture the relationship between the variables, and feeding the resulting feature matrix to an LSTM-based autoencoder for prediction. The DW-CAE model was used to make predictions on the Beijing (Formula presented.) dataset and the Yining air pollution dataset, and its prediction accuracy was compared to that of eight baseline models, such as LSTM, IMV-Full, and DARNN. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed DW-CAE model is more accurate than other baseline models at predicting single and multiple pollution factors, and the R2 of each variable is all higher than 93% for the overall prediction of the six air pollutants. This demonstrates the efficacy of the DW-CAE model, which can give technical and theoretical assistance for the forecast, prevention, and control of overall air pollution. © 2023 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su15097367,2,2,Yes,LSTM,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,discrete wavelet transform,,,,,,,,

Many of the cities which are developed suffered from severe air quality (AQ) because of the rapid growth in industrialization and population.

At the initial stage, the presented DLAPP-SEDP technique performs various levels of data pre-processing such as missing value replacement, categorical value encoding, normalization, and feature selection. In the next stage, the DLAPP-SEDP technique employs graph convolutional network (GCN) model. Finally, the DLAPP-SEDP technique utilizes atomic orbital search optimization (AOSO) algorithm for optimal hyperparameter tuning process, showing the novelty of the work.

Today, we have produced over 350,000 chemicals, and current testing strategies do not meet the demands. Therefore, it is important to develop new approach methodologies (NAMs) that can help fill current information gaps. Toxicology needs to evolve from hazard and risk assessments based on morphological endpoints in animal tests towards a mechanism-driven integrated approach that better includes computational modelling as well as molecular, human, and in vitro data. The application of new science and technology such as different types of imaging and omics methods can allow faster collection of high-quality toxicological data for hazard identification and better prediction of toxicological potential using advanced in silico approaches including machine learning. A shift toward active prevention of pollution through a safe and sustainable-by-design approach based on cutting-edge science could significantly help safeguard the population and planetary health. Moreover, it is necessary to improve the understanding of how interactions among chemical mixtures, climate change, infectious agents, and other stressors that constitute the exposome, may affect biota and human health. Individual responses to current exposures and susceptibility to disease are influenced by factors such as genetics, epigenetics, physiology, and health status, which involve changes in biological pathways caused by own previous exposures or even ancestral exposures. It is therefore important to better consider individual exposomes and susceptibility in future risk assessments and precision medicine.

The analysis and prediction results demonstrated that the MJO improved the predictive skill of the extended-range PM2.5 forecast. The MJO indexes, namely, real-time multivariate MJO series 1 (RMM1) and real-time multivariate MJO series 2 (RMM2), ranked the first, and seventh, respectively, in terms of the predictive contribution of all meteorological predictors. When the MJO was not introduced, the correlation coefficients for the forecasts on lead times of 11–40 days ranged from 0.27 to 0.55, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranged from 23.4 to 31.8 μg/m3. After the MJO was introduced, the correlation coefficients for the 11–40 day forecast ranged from 0.31 to 0.56, among which those for the 16–40 day forecast substantially improved, and the RMSEs ranged from 23.2 to 28.7 μg/m3. When comparing the prediction scores, such as percent correct (PC), critical success index (CSI), and equitable threat score (ETS), the forecast model was more accurate when it introduced the MJO. A novel aspect of this study is to investigate the effects of the MJO mechanism on the meteorological conditions of air pollution in eastern China through advanced regression analysis. The MJO indexes RMM1 and RMM2 considerably impacted the geopotential height field of 28°–40° at 300–250 hPa 45 days in advance. When RMM1 increased and RMM2 decreased 45 days in advance, the 500 hPa geopotential height field weakened accordingly, and the bottom of the 500 hPa trough moved southward; thus cold air was more easily transported southward and the upstream air pollutants were transported to eastern China. With a weak ground pressure field and dry air at low altitudes, the westerly wind component increased, which led to the easier formation of a weather configuration favorable for the accumulation and transport of air pollution, thus resulting in an increase in PM2.5 concentration in the region. These findings can guide forecasters regarding the utility of MJO and S2S for subseasonal air pollution outlooks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163358,2,2,Yes,LGBM,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides, two input approaches are evaluated: using only the data from the own time series of the pollutant in the first case or adding exogenous variables in the second one. Several window sizes are employed (24, 28 and 72 hours) with ANNs and LSTMNAs. Additionally, several feature ranking methods are applied in the exogenous approach to select the most relevant lagged variables to feed the models. Results show how the proposed exogenous approach increases the performance of the prediction models.

It is based on the state-of-the-art Transformer neural network and various data embedding techniques. By performing attention calculations among features over time steps, TPPM25 mimics cognitive attention and selectively enhances essential parts of the input data while diminishing other parts. TPPM25 is able to effectively capture temporal relations to multiple influencing meteorological features. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing with a cutting-edge ensemble deep learning model from Zhang et al. (Inf Sci 544:427–445, 2021). Our TPPM25 model outperforms Zhang et al.’s model under the same experimental setting on a well-researched benchmark dataset. As Zhang et al.’s model is restricted to univariate PM 2.5 prediction, our TPPM25 model bypasses this restriction and further improves the prediction accuracy when considering more influencing meteorological features.

Multilayer perceptron, Boosted Multilayer perceptron, and Bagging Multilayer perceptron has error rates of 0.998, 0.998, and 0.877, respectively, and have MSE errors of 2.87, 1.19, and 5.57. Additionally, considering the MAPE 1.51E−02, 1.09E−02, and 2.26E−02 values acquired. Finally, the boosted multilayer perceptron is the most general and accurate model. Additionally, the optimal output value is 98.99 when the input vector is (x1 = 158, x2 = 1.25, x3 = 33.75). © 2023 The Author(s)",Environmental Technology and Innovation,10.1016/j.eti.2023.103018,2,2,No,,,,"China,Oman,India,Saudi Arabia,Iraq,Pakistan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Air pollution is a serious health risk and environmental concerns in many countries. Turkey has seen major industrial development in recent years which has led to increasing levels of air pollution. In this study, the air pollution levels of Sakarya, a major industrial city in Turkey, is analysed by calculating and modelling daily carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations. The CO values ​​are calculated using deep learning (Long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)) models. These models are benchmarked against machine learning (Artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), and support vector regression (SVR)) methods. The daily antecedent values ​​of observed CO and PM10 parameters were used as inputs. Considering the correlation between these parameters, 6 different input scenarios with maximum 3-day delays were created and the daily CO values ​​were calculated. The results showed that the LSTM and Bi-LSTM models were the most effective with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.91, then the kernel-based SVR was ranked with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.88. Among the 6 scenarios used, the scenario whereby the inputs were 3-lag time with CO values ​​and one-lag delay of PM10 values was found to be the most effective. The deep learning methods have been observed to give reliable results in air pollution modelling. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.",International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,10.1007/s13762-022-04702-x,2,2,Yes,"LSTM,ANN,KNN,SVR",,,"Iran,Turkey,Fiji",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Air quality measurements were initiated in different backgrounds including urban, suburban, industrial and rural to detect any significant changes in air quality parameters. Due to the dynamic nature of the weather, geographical location and anthropogenic sources, many uncertainties must be considered when dealing with air pollution data. In recent years, the Bayesian approach to fitting statistical models has gained more popularity due to its alternative modelling strategy that accounted for uncertainties for all air quality parameters. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the performance of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) in predicting the next-day PM10 concentration in Peninsular Malaysia. A case study utilized seventeen years’ worth of air quality monitoring data from nine (9) monitoring stations located in Peninsular Malaysia, using eight air quality parameters, i.e., PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. The performances of the next-day PM10 prediction were calculated using five models’ performance evaluators, namely Coefficient of Determination (R2), Index of Agreement (IA), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The BMA models indicate that relative humidity, wind speed and PM10 contributed the most to the prediction model for the majority of stations with (R2 = 0.752 at Pasir Gudang monitoring station), (R2 = 0.749 at Larkin monitoring station), (R2 = 0.703 at Kota Bharu monitoring station), (R2 = 0.696 at Kangar monitoring station) and (R2 = 0.692 at Jerantut monitoring station), respectively. Furthermore, the BMA models demonstrated a good prediction model performance, with IA ranging from 0.84 to 0.91, R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.75 and KGE ranging from 0.61 to 0.74 for all monitoring stations. According to the results of the investigation, BMA should be utilised in research and forecasting operations pertaining to environmental issues such as air pollution. From this study, BMA is recommended as one of the prediction tools for forecasting air pollution concentration, especially particulate matter level. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14020311,2,2,Yes,BMA,,,"Malaysia,Romania",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The widespread use of the Internet has provided new ways for the public to understand environmental pollution. In this paper, a combined gray relation analysis and bidirectional long short-term memory model is proposed for predicting public attention about air pollution in three cities: Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The prediction of public attention is influenced by a variety of factors, and nine influencing factors were selected for gray correlation analysis in this study. Subsequently, seven key factors with strong correlations were selected as input indicators for the prediction model to predict public attention. When compared with the results of other models, the combined GRA-BiLSTM model proposed in this study has good predictive performance. Finally, taking into account the effect of lags, lagging in the input indicators can significantly improve the predictive performance of the model, verifying the existence of lags in public concern about air pollution. The environmental protection department can pay attention to the public attention about air pollution to better control it.

The values of the predictors at future moments are gathered from official weather forecast sites as independent ex-ante data. They are updated with new forecasted values every day. Each new sample is used to build- a separate single model that simultaneously predicts future pollution levels. The sought forecasts were estimated by averaging the actual predictions of the single models. The strategy was applied to three pollutants—PM10, SO2, and NO2—in the city of Pernik, Bulgaria. Random forest (RF) and arcing (Arc-x4) machine learning algorithms were applied to the modeling. Although there are many highly changing day-to-day predictors, the proposed averaging strategy shows a promising alternative to single models. In most cases, the root mean squared errors (RMSE) of the averaging models (aRF and aAR) for the last 10 horizons are lower than those of the single models. In particular, for PM10, the aRF’s RMSE is 13.1 vs. 13.8 micrograms per cubic meter for the single model; for the NO2 model, the aRF exhibits 21.5 vs. 23.8; for SO2, the aAR has 17.3 vs. 17.4; for NO2, the aAR’s RMSE is 22.7 vs. 27.5, respectively.

There is however a lack of large-scale studies dealing with accurate determination of annual maximum daily concentration (AMDC) across the landscape and over time based on the publicly available monitoring data. We developed a novel data-driven approach that firstly used time series modeling to generate AMDCs for qualified water monitoring sites in the conterminous U.S. With feature variables such as pesticide use and land cover compiled into the dataset, machine learning models using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest Regressor (RF) were then developed to estimate AMDCs in surface waters across the U.S. Both models exhibited significant predictability, while a hybrid model consisting of the average predictions by XGBoost and RF model had the highest prediction accuracy (mean absolute error (MAE): 1.23; R2: 0.61). The analysis of permutation variable importance indicated that pesticide use and drainage area were the two most important drivers. Partial dependence analysis revealed that pesticide use, precipitation, cultivated crop land cover and solubility exhibited concentration-promoting effects, whereas drainage area and molecular weight had concentration-demoting effects. Soil adsorption coefficient (Koc) showed nonmonotonic effects. The hybrid model was used to predict and map AMDCs of four example pesticides, including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), atrazine, glyphosate and imidacloprid during 2016–2019 at national scale. The predictive capability was validated using independent monitoring datasets. The fully evaluated approach significantly reduced the uncertainties in modeling annual peak concentrations and served as a valuable solution for conducting geographically oriented, highly refined exposure assessments for pesticides. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161190,2,2,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uncertainties in weather forecasts contributed 38%–54% of the ozone forecast errors at 24-hr lead time and beyond. The 2DCNN-SOEF enabled an “ozone exceedance probability” metric, which better represented the risks of air pollution given the range of possible weather outcomes.

Here we focused on a fully data-driven exploration regarding which factors (clinical or otherwise) were most informative for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia severity prediction via machine learning (ML). In particular, feature selection techniques (FS), designed to reduce the dimensionality of data, allowed us to characterize which of our variables were the most useful for ML prognosis. We conducted a multi-centre clinical study, enrolling n = 1548 patients hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: where 792, 238, and 598 patients experienced low, medium and high-severity evolutions, respectively. Up to 106 patient-specific clinical variables were collected at admission, although 14 of them had to be discarded for containing 60% missing values. Alongside 7 socioeconomic attributes and 32 exposures to air pollution (chronic and acute), these became d = 148 features after variable encoding. We addressed this ordinal classification problem both as a ML classification and regression task. Two imputation techniques for missing data were explored, along with a total of 166 unique FS algorithm configurations: 46 filters, 100 wrappers and 20 embeddeds. Of these, 21 setups achieved satisfactory bootstrap stability (≥0.70) with reasonable computation times: 16 filters, 2 wrappers, and 3 embeddeds. The subsets of features selected by each technique showed modest Jaccard similarities across them. However, they consistently pointed out the importance of certain explanatory variables. Namely: patient's C-reactive protein (CRP), pneumonia severity index (PSI), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen levels -saturation Sp O2, quotients Sp O2/RR and arterial Sat O2/Fi O2-, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) - to certain extent, also neutrophil and lymphocyte counts separately-, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and procalcitonin (PCT) levels in blood. A remarkable agreement has been found a posteriori between our strategy and independent clinical research works investigating risk factors for COVID-19 severity. Hence, these findings stress the suitability of this type of fully data-driven approaches for knowledge extraction, as a complementary to clinical perspectives. © 2023 Hayet-Otero et al.",PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0284150,2,2,No,,,,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, more and more machine-learning-based methods have been used to solve the air quality prediction problem. However, the uncertainty of environmental changes and the difficulty of precisely predicting quantitative values seriously influence prediction results. In this paper, the proposed air pollutant quality grade prediction method based on a hyperparameter-optimization-inspired long short-term memory (LSTM) network provides two advantages. Firstly, the definition of air quality grade is introduced in the air quality prediction task, which turns a fitting problem into a classification problem and makes the complex problem simple; secondly, the hunter–prey optimization algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the LSTM structure to obtain the optimal network structure adaptively determined through the use of input data, which can include more generalization abilities.

In this study, we aimed to quantify PM2.5 (diameter less than 2.5 μm, PM2.5) and associated metals derived from local sources and LRT in different geographic locations in Taiwan using advanced receptor models. We collected daily PM2.5 samples (n = ∼1000) and analyzed 28 metals every three days from 2016 to 2018 in the northern, central-south, eastern, and southern areas of Taiwan. We first used a machine learning technique with a cluster algorithm coupled with a backward trajectory to classify local, regional, and LRT-related aerosols. We then quantified the source contributions with a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model for Taiwan weighted by region-specific populations. The northern and eastern regions were found to be more vulnerable to LRT-related PM2.5 and metals than the central-south and southern regions in Taiwan. The LRT increased Pb and As concentrations by 90–200% and ∼40% in the northern and central-south regions. Ambient PM2.5-metals mainly originated from local traffic-related emissions in the northern, central-south, and southern regions, whereas oil combustion was the primary source of PM2.5-metals in the eastern region. By subtracting the influence from the LRT, the contributions of domestic emission sources to ambient PM2.5 metals in Taiwan were 35% from traffic-related emission, 17% from non-ferrous metallurgy, 13% from iron ore and steel factories, 12% from coal combustion, 12% from oil combustion, 10% from incinerator emissions, and <1% from cement manufacturing emissions.

The difficulties in deriving near-surface concentrations from satellite measurements restrict the application of remote sensing of large-scale surface air quality. Aiming at providing daily accurate near-surface ail pollution estimates (PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, and CO), we propose a robust estimation framework called learning air pollutants from satellite observations (LAPSO). The principle of LAPSO is to derive a nonlinear relationship between surface pollutant concentrations of interest and satellite observations with the aid of meteorological reanalyzes based on deep learning techniques. The LAPSO framework is superior to other algorithms due to its robust retrieval performance, independence from chemical transport models (CTMs), lower hardware requirements, and a user-friendly interface. The retrieval results of LAPSO were in good agreement with ground-level measurements according to extensive cross-validation at 1628 sites (R2 > 0.8 in polluted areas and uncertainty ≪ 5μg/m3 for most pollutants) in China. The framework also showed a strong capability to capture the temporal variability of different air pollutants. By comparing with the estimation results from different satellite platforms, TROPOspheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5P demonstrated marginally better performance for estimating PM2.5. Although the selection of satellite observations did not significantly affect the results of O3 estimation, the number and spatial sampling density of in situ sites imposed large impacts on O3 estimation performance. The success of LAPSO for estimating near-surface concentrations from satellite remote sensing at an enhanced spatiotemporal resolution is expected to serve the continuous and dynamical monitoring of regional and global air pollution. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,10.1109/tgrs.2023.3248180,2,2,"Yes,no access",,,,"United Kingdom,China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we developed a hybrid model CMAQ-RLINE_URBAN to quantitatively analyze the effects of vehicle emissions on urban roadside NO2 concentrations at a high spatial resolution of 50m×50m. To estimate the influence of various street canyons on the dispersion of air pollutants, a machine-learning-based street canyon flow (MLSCF) scheme was established based on computational fluid dynamics and two machine learning methods. The results indicated that compared with the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, the hybrid model improved the underestimation of NO2 concentration at near-road sites with the mean bias (MB) changing from -10 to 6.3µgm-3. The MLSCF scheme obviously increased upwind concentrations within deep street canyons due to changes in the wind environment caused by the vortex. In summer, the relative contribution of vehicles to NO2 concentrations in Beijing urban areas was 39% on average, similar to results from the CMAQ-ISAM (Integrated Source Apportionment Method) model, but it increased significantly with the decreased distance to the road centerline, especially on urban freeways, where it reached 75%. © Copyright:",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,10.5194/acp-22-15685-2022,3,2,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was to optimize a personal exposure model based on spatiotemporal model predictions for PM2.5 exposure in a sub-cohort study. Personal, home indoor, home outdoor, and ambient monitoring data of PM2.5 were conducted for an elderly population in the Taipei city of Taiwan. The proposed microenvironment exposure (ME) models incorporate PM2.5 measurements and individual time-activity information with a generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis. We evaluated model performance with daily personal PM2.5 exposure based on the coefficient of determination, accuracy, and mean bias error. Ambient and home outdoor measures as exposure surrogates are likely to under- and overestimate personal exposure to PM2.5 in our study population, respectively. Measured and predicted indoor exposures were highly correlated with personal PM2.5 exposure. The awareness of peculiar smells is an important factor that significantly increases personal PM2.5 exposure by 46–70%. The model incorporating home indoor PM2.5 can achieve the highest agreement (R2 = 0.790) with personal exposure and the lowest measurement error. The ME model with the GEE analysis combining home outdoor PM2.5 determined by LUR model with a machine learning technique can improve the prediction (R2 = 0.592) of personal PM2.5 exposure, compared with the prediction of the traditional LUR model (R2 = 0.385). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120538,2,2,No,,,,Taiwan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, other statistical and machine-learning methods have also been applied to model air pollution, but their relative strengths and limitations have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we developed and compared land-use statistical and machine-learning models at annual, monthly and daily scales estimating ground-level NO2 concentrations across Switzerland (at high spatial resolution 100 × 100 m). Our study showed that the best model type varies with context, particularly with temporal resolution and training data size. Linear-regression-based models were useful in predicting long-term (annual, monthly) spatial distribution of NO2 and outperformed machine-learning models. However, linear-regression-based models were limited in representing short-term temporal variation even when predictor variables with temporal variability were provided. Machine-learning models showed high capability in predicting short-term temporal variation and outperformed linear-regression-based models for modeling NO2 variation at high temporal resolution (daily). However, the best performing models, XGBoost and LightGBM, constantly overfit on training data and may result in erratic patterns in the model-estimated concentration surfaces. Therefore, the temporal and spatial scale of the study is an important factor on which the choice of the suitable model type should be based and validation is required whatever approach is used. © 2022 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",Atmospheric Pollution Research,10.1016/j.apr.2022.101611,3,2,Yes,"LR,RF,XGB,LGBM,ANN",,Yes,Switzerland,,estimation,NO2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study conducted by the Swiss organization IQAir indicated that 22 of the top 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India. This creates the problem of air pollution, which is very relevant to India as well. Exposure to air pollutants has both acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) impacts on health. Among the major air pollutants, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is the most harmful, and its long-term exposure can impair lung functions. Pollutant concentrations vary temporally and are dependent on the local meteorology and emissions at a given geographic location. PM2.5 forecasting models have the potential to develop strategies for evaluating and alerting the public regarding expected hazardous levels of air pollution. Accurate measurement and forecasting of pollutant concentrations are critical for assessing air quality and making informed strategic decisions. Recently, data-driven machine learning algorithms for PM2.5 forecasting have received a lot of attention. In this work, a spatio-temporal analysis of air quality was first performed for Hyderabad, indicating that average PM2.5 concentrations during the winter were 68% higher than those during the summer. Following that, PM2.5 modelling was done using three different techniques: multilinear regression, K-nearest neighbours (KNN), and histogram-based gradient boost (HGBoost). Among these, the HGBoost regression model, which used both pollution and meteorological data as inputs, outperformed the other two techniques. During testing, the model acquired an amazing R2 value of 0.859, suggesting a significant connection with the actual data. Additionally, the model exhibited a minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.717 μg/m3 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.647 μg/m3, further confirming its accuracy in predicting PM2.5 concentrations. In our investigation, we discovered that the HGBoost3 model beat other PM2.5 modelling models by having the lowest error and the highest R2 value. This study made a substantial addition by incorporating the spatiotemporal relationship between air pollutants and meteorological variables in predicting air quality. This method has the potential to improve the creation of more precise air pollution forecast models. © 2023 The Author(s).

Sustainable transportation systems (STSs) play a crucial role in traffic congestion prediction for adopting transportation networks to improve the efficiency and capacity of traffic management. In STSs, one of the essential functional areas is the advanced traffic management system, which alleviates traffic congestion by locating traffic bottlenecks to intensify the interpretation of the traffic network. Furthermore, in urban areas, accurate short-term traffic congestion forecasting is critical for designing transport infrastructure and for the real-time optimization of traffic. The main objective of this paper was to devise a method to predict short-term traffic congestion (STTC) every 5 min over 1 h. This paper proposes a hybrid Xception support vector machine (XPSVM) classifier model to predict STTC. Primarily, the Xception classifier uses separable convolution, ReLU, and convolution techniques to predict the feature detection in the dataset. Secondarily, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier operates maximum marginal separations to predict the output more accurately using the weight regularization technique and a fine-tuned binary hyperplane mechanism.

Air pollution forecasting is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying pollution in a specific region, but analyzing high-dimensional data with spatial and temporal dependencies poses a major challenge for traditional machine learning approaches. Additionally, missing sensor measurements due to malfunctions and connectivity loss have severely limited air pollution forecasting models' performance and restricted their use in production systems. Although significant efforts have been made in air pollution forecasting, many approaches face challenges in dealing with missing sensor data. Based on past and current research, this paper proposes and evaluates four encoder-decoder architectures with attention for forecasting particulate matter (PM) levels that are location- and season-independent. To handle missing sensor data, this paper also proposes and evaluates two adversarial networks for data augmentation. We conducted experiments to investigate the performance of predictive models with and without augmenting training datasets, and using the proposed adversarial models for data augmentation resulted in superior performance gains.

In this paper, we show model development and evaluate its performance as the sample size and source vary. We discuss the characteristics of the dataset that tended to help the source identification and why. For example, we show that data from many events and from different apartments are essential for the model to be suitable for analyzing a new separate dataset. We also show that longitudinal data appear to be more helpful than the time frequency of measurements within a given apartment.

Among the many options for studying plant physiology, electrical potential and tissue impedance are arguably simple measurement techniques that can be used to gather plant-level information. Despite the many possible uses, our research is exclusively driven by the idea of phytosensing, that is, interpreting living plants' signals to gather information about surrounding environmental conditions. As ready-to-use plant-level physiological models are not available, we consider the plant as a blackbox and apply statistics and machine learning to automatically interpret measured signals. In simple plant experiments, we expose Zamioculcas zamiifolia and Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) to four different stimuli: wind, heat, red light and blue light. We measure electrical potential and tissue impedance signals. Given these signals, we evaluate a large variety of methods from statistical discriminant analysis and from deep learning, for the classification problem of determining the stimulus to which the plant was exposed. We identify a set of methods that successfully classify stimuli with good accuracy, without a clear winner. The statistical approach is competitive, partially depending on data availability for the machine learning approach. Our extensive results show the feasibility of the blackbox approach and can be used in future research to select appropriate classifier techniques for a given use case. In our own future research, we will exploit these methods to derive a phytosensing approach to monitoring air pollution in urban areas.",BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS,10.1088/1748-3190/acbad2,2,2,No,,,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, multiple machine-learning (ML) models-linear regression, random forest (RF), AdaBoost, and neural networks (NNs)-were used to explore the potential impacts of air-pollutant concentrations on the incidence of pediatric respiratory diseases in Taizhou, China. A number of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods were further applied to analyze the model outputs and quantify the feature importance. Our results demonstrate that there are significant seasonal variations both in the numbers of pediatric respiratory outpatients and the concentrations of air pollutants. The concentrations of NO2, CO, and particulate matter (PM 10(sic) and PM 2.5(sic) ), as well as the numbers of outpatients, reach their peak values in the winter. This indicates that air pollution is a major factor in pediatric respiratory diseases. The results of the regression models show that ML methods can capture the trends and turning points of clinic visits, and the non-linear models were superior to the linear ones. Among them, the RF model served as the best-performing model. The analysis on the RF model by XAI found that AQI, O-3, PM 10(sic) , and the current month are the most important predictors affecting the numbers of pediatric respiratory outpatients. This shows that the number of outpatients rises with an increasing AQI, especially with the increasing of particulate matter. Our study indicates that ML models with XAI methods are promising for revealing the underlying impacts of air pollution on the pediatric respiratory diseases, which further assists the health-related decision-making.",FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,10.3389/feart.2023.1105140,2,2,No,,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The feature importance results show that cloud optical depth (COD), relative humidity, and precipitation are the top three factors affecting CTM high biases. Such results indicate that the high ozone biases in summer over China mainly occur on wet/cloudy days (similar to 40% biased high), while biases on dry/clear days are small (within 5%). We link the important features with model parameterizations and variables, identifying model underestimates in the dry deposition velocity and COD on wet/cloudy days. By accounting for the enhanced dry deposition on wet plant cuticles and using satellite observation constrained COD, we find that CTM high ozone biases can be halved with an improved agreement in the temporal variability, highlighting the effects of dry deposition and COD on ozone, as suggested by the RF outcomes.",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,10.1021/acs.est.2c05712,4,2,Yes,RF,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although various studies have shown an association between air pollution and asthma, few studies have used statistical and machine learning algorithms to investigate the effect of each individual air pollutant on asthma. The purpose of this research was to assess the association between air pollutants and the frequency of hospital visits by asthma patients using three analysis methods: linear correlation analyses were performed by Pearson correlation coefficients, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest (RF) models were used for machine learning-based analyses to investigate the effect of air pollutants. This research studied asthma patients using the hospital visit database in Seoul, South Korea, collected between 2013 and 2017. The data set included outpatient hospital visits (n = 17,787,982), hospital admissions (n = 215,696), and emergency department visits (n = 85,482). The daily atmospheric environmental information from 2013 to 2017 at 25 locations in Seoul was evaluated. The three analysis models revealed that NO2 was the most significant pollutant on average in outpatient hospital visits by asthma patients. For example, NO2 had the greatest impact on outpatient hospital visits, resulting in a positive association (r = 0.331). In hospital admissions of asthma patients, CO was the most significant pollutant on average. It was observed that CO exhibited the most positive association with hospital admissions (I = 3.329). Additionally, a significant time lag was found between both NO2 and CO and outpatient hospital visits and hospital admissions of asthma patients in the linear correlation analysis. In particular, NO2 and CO were shown to increase hospital admissions at lag 4 in the linear correlation analysis. This study provides evidence that PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and O-3 are associated with the frequency of hospital visits by asthma patients.",TOXICS,10.3390/toxics10110644,4,2,No,,,,South Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the impact of the lockdown due to COVID-19 on multiple cities, this study utilized data from 18 cities of Henan to understand the air quality pattern change during COVID-19 from 2019 to 2021. It examined the temporal and spatial distribution impact. This study firstly utilized a deep learning bi-directional long-term short-term (Bi-LSTM) model to predict air quality patterns during 3 periods, i.e., COVID-A (before COVID-19, i.e., 2019), COVID-B (during COVID-19, i.e., 2020), COVID-C (after COVID-19 cases, i.e., 2021) and obtained the R-2 value of more than 72% average in each year and decreased MAE value, which was better than other studies' deep learning methods. This study secondly focused on the change of pollutants and observed an increase in Air Quality Index by 10%, a decrease in PM2.5 by 14%, PM10 by 18%, NO2 by 14%, and SO2 by 16% during the COVID-B period. This study found an increase in O-3 by 31% during the COVID-C period and observed a significant decrease in pollutants during the COVID-C period (PM10 by 42%, PM2.5 by 97%, NO2 by 89%, SO2 by 36%, CO by 58%, O-3 by 31%). Lastly, the impact of lockdown policies was studied during the COVID-B period and the results showed that Henan achieved the Grade I standards of air quality standards after lockdown was implemented. Although there were many severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on human health and the global economy, lockdowns likely resulted in significant short-term health advantages owing to reduced air pollution and significantly improved ambient air quality.

Access to clean, sustainable and affordable energy, outlined in the seventh Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 7) of the United Nations, plays a crucial role in advancing health (SDG 3), as unclean cooking energy may endanger people's health by causing air pollution. However, due to endogeneity problems such as reverse causality, the health consequences of environmental pollution caused by unclean fuel usage are difficult to be scientifically and accurately evaluated. This paper aims to systematically assess the health cost of unclean fuel usage based on tackling endogeneity, using the data from Chinese General Social Survey. The ordinary least squares model, ordered regression methods, instrumental variable approach, penalized machine learning methods, placebo test, and mediation models are applied in this research. Analytical results demonstrate that households' unclean fuel use significantly damages people's health. Specifically, the use of dirty fuel leads to an average of about a one-standard-deviation decline in self-rated health, demonstrating its notable negative effect. The findings are robust to a series of robustness and endogeneity tests. The impact mechanism is that unclean fuel usage reduces people's self-rated health through increasing indoor pollution. Meanwhile, the negative effect of dirty fuel use on health has significant heterogeneity among different subgroups. The consequences are more prominent for the vulnerable groups who are female, younger, living in rural areas and older buildings, with lower socio-economic status and uncovered by social security. Therefore, necessary measures should be taken to improve energy infrastructure to make clean cooking energy more affordable and accessible as well as to enhance people's health.

Gas concentration can be determined by using gas sensors in temperature-cycled operation (TCO) and ML on the measured logarithmic resistance of the sensor. This contribution focuses on formaldehyde as one of the most relevant carcinogenic gases indoors and on the sum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), i.e., acetone, ethanol, formaldehyde, and toluene, measured in the data set as an indicator for IAQ. As gas concentrations are continuous quantities, regression must be used. Thus, a previously published uncertainty-aware automated ML toolbox (UA-AMLT) for classification is extended for regression by introducing an uncertainty-aware partial least squares regression (PLSR) algorithm. The uncertainty propagation of the UA-AMLT is based on the principles described in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements. Two different use cases are considered for investigating the influence on ML results in this contribution, namely model training with raw data and with data that are manipulated by adding artificially generated white Gaussian or uniform noise to simulate increased data uncertainty, respectively. One of the benefits of this approach is to obtain a better understanding of where the overall system should be improved. This can be achieved by either improving the trained ML model or using a sensor with higher precision. Finally, an increase in robustness against random noise by training a model with noisy data is demonstrated.",JOURNAL OF SENSORS AND SENSOR SYSTEMS,10.5194/jsss-12-45-2023,2,2,No,,,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electric two-wheelers (E-TW) are a better alternative to conventional two-wheelers because of their significant advantage in mitigating environmental impacts. But E-TWs are less attractive among road users due to unawareness of the benefits of E-TW. In addition, the traditional methods are less accurate in predicting users' mode choice behavior because of their limitations. Therefore, there is a need to conduct a study to understand the road user's willingness to adopt E-TW and find a suitable method for predicting mode choice behavior accurately. This study analyzes the Indian road users encouraging and discouraging factors to adopt E-TW and investigates the application of non-traditional models for estimating mode shift behaviour towards E-TW. Based on the literature review and expert opinion, a detailed questionnaire form was framed, and a total of 522 samples were collected from four states of India. The data findings show that Indian road users prefer TW compared to public transport, private four-wheeler, paratransit, and non-motorized transport because of its easy to ride, low maintenance, fast and convenient travel nature. The environmental concern of reducing air pollution and lower vehicle operating costs are significant factors that encourage E-TW adoption. However, the non-availability of charging infrastructure, lower speed, higher initial purchase cost, and lack of awareness about EVs are the significant discouraging factors in adopting ETW in India. Further, Machine Learning (ML) methods were adopted to predict the mode shift behaviour from the fuel based TW to E-TW, and the results were compared with the Binary Logit (BL) method. The model results indicated that Support vector machine predicted the mode shift behavior with the highest accuracy rate compared with other methods such as Artificial Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and BL. The outcome of this study would help the transportation planner, EV manufacturers, researchers, and policymakers to understand the Indian user's preference to adopt E-TW. & COPY; 2022 Tongji University and Tongji University Press.

The study estimated the causal relationship between diabetes and PM2.5 using two sample mendelian randomization (TSMR). Methods: We collected genetic data from European ancestry publicly available genome wide association studies (GWAS) summary data through the MR-BASE repository. The IEU GWAS information output PM2.5 from the Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) GWAS pipeline using pheasant-derived variables (Consortium = MRC-IEU, sample size: 423,796). The annual relationship of PM2.5 (2010) were modeled for each address using a Land Use Regression model developed as part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution E ects. Diabetes GWAS information (Consortium = MRC-IEU, sample size: 461,578) were used, and the genetic variants were used as the instrumental variables (IVs). We performed three representative Mendelian Randomization (MR) methods: Inverse Variance Weighted regression (IVW), Egger, and weighted median for causal relationship using genetic variants. Furthermore, we used a novel method called MR Mixture to identify outlier SNPs. Results: Fromthe IVWmethod, we revealed the causal relationship between PM2.5 and diabetes (Odds ratio [OR]: 1.041, 95% CI: 1.008-1.076, P = 0.016), and the finding was substantiated by the absence of any directional horizontal pleiotropy through MR-Egger regression (beta = 0.016, P = 0.687). From the IVW fixed-e ect method (i.e., one of the MR machine learning mixture methods), we excluded outlier SNP (rs1537371) and showed the best predictivemodel (AUC = 0.72) with a causal relationship between PM2.5 and diabetes (OR: 1.028, 95% CI: 1.006-1.049, P = 0.012).

However, little research has been conducted on the combined effects of air pollutant mixture on renal function and multiple mediation effects of metabolic risk factors. This study enrolled 8996 adults without chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline from the CHCN-BTH cohort study. Three-year exposure to air pollutants [particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), PM10 , PM1 , ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO)] and PM2.5 components [black carbon (BC), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-) and organic matter (OM)] were assessed using well-validated machine learning methods. Linear mixed models were applied to investigate the associa -tions between air pollutants and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Quantile G-computation was used to assess the combined effects of pollutant mixtures. Causal mediation analysis and Bayesian mediation analysis were employed to estimate the mediation effects of metabolic risk factors. An interquartile range increases in BC (-0.256, 95 %CI:-0.331,-0.180) and OM (-0.603, 95 %CI:-0.810,-0.397) were significantly associated with eGFR decline; while O3 (1.151, 95 %CI: 0.813, 1.489), PM10 (0.721, 95 %CI: 0.309, 1.133), NH4+ (0.990, 95 %CI: 0.638, 1.342), and NO3- (0.610, 95 %CI: 0.405, 0.815) were associated with higher eGFR. The combined effect of the PM2.5 component mixture was found to be associated with lower eGFR (-1.147, 95 % CI:-1.456,-0.839), with OM contributing 72.4 % of the negative effect. Univariate mediation analyses showed that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) mediated 7.1 %, 6.9 %, and 6.1 % effects of O3 , BC, and OM, respectively. However, these mediation effects were not significant in Bayesian mediation analysis. These findings suggest the effect of the PM2.5 component mixture on eGFR decline and the strong contribution of OM. Metabolic risk factors may not mediate the effects of air pollutants.

This study aims to evaluate the association between PM2.5 and PTC and determine the subgroups of patients who are at the highest risk of PTC diagnosis.MethodsUnder IRB approval, we conducted a case-control study of adult patients (age >= 18) newly diagnosed with PTC between 1/2013-12/2016 across a single health care system were identified using electronic medical records. These patients were compared to a control group of patients without any evidence of thyroid disease. Cumulative PM2.5 exposure was calculated for each patient using a deep learning neural networks model, which incorporated meteorological and satellite-based measurements at the patients' residential zip code. Adjusted multivariate logistic regression was used to quantify the association between cumulative PM2.5 exposure and PTC diagnosis. We tested whether this association differed by gender, race, BMI, smoking history, current alcohol use, and median household income.ResultsA cohort of 1990 patients with PTC and a control group of 6919 patients without thyroid disease were identified. Compared to the control group, patients with PTC were more likely to be older (51.2 vs. 48.8 years), female (75.5% vs 46.8%), White (75.2% vs. 61.6%), and never smokers (71.1% vs. 58.4%) (p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, current alcohol use, median household income, current smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, and asthma, 3-year cumulative PM2.5 exposure was associated with a 1.41-fold increased odds of PTC diagnosis (95%CI: 1.23-1.62). This association varied by median household income (p-interaction =0.03). Compared to those with a median annual household income <$50,000, patients with a median annual household income between $50,000 and < $100,000 had a 43% increased risk of PTC diagnosis (aOR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.19-1.72), and patients with median household income >=$100,000 had a 77% increased risk of PTC diagnosis (aOR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.37-2.29).ConclusionsCumulative exposure to PM2.5 over 3 years was significantly associated with the diagnosis of PTC.

OBJECTIVE To assess the association of PM2.5 exposure with emergency department (ED) visits during the first year of life and determine whether preterm birth status modifies the association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This individual-level cohort study used data from the Study of Outcomes in Mothers and Infants cohort, which includes all live-born, singleton deliveries in California. Data from infants' health records through their first birthday were included. Participants included 2 175 180 infants born between 2014 and 2018, and complete data were included for an analytic sample of 1 983 700 (91.2%). Analysis was conducted from October 2021 to September 2022. EXPOSURES Weekly PM2.5 exposure at the residential ZIP code at birth was estimated from an ensemble model combining multiple machine learning algorithms and several potentially associated variables. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcomes included the first all-cause ED visit and the first infection- and respiratory-related visits separately. Hypotheseswere generated after data collection and prior to analysis. Pooled logistic regression models with a discrete time approach assessed PM2.5 exposure and time to ED visits during each week of the first year of life and across the entire year. Preterm birth status, sex, and payment type for delivery were assessed as effect modifiers. RESULTS Of the 1 983 700 infants, 979 038 (49.4%) were female, 966 349 (48.7%) were Hispanic, and 142 081 (7.2%) were preterm. Across the first year of life, the odds of an ED visit for any cause were greater among both preterm (AOR, 1.056; 95% CI, 1.048-1.064) and full-term (AOR, 1.051; 95% CI, 1.049-1.053) infants for each 5-mu g/m(3) increase in exposure to PM2.5. Elevated odds were also observed for infection-related ED visit (preterm: AOR, 1.035; 95% CI, 1.001-1.069; full-term: AOR, 1.053; 95% CI, 1.044-1.062) and first respiratory-related ED visit (preterm: AOR, 1.080; 95% CI, 1.067-1.093; full-term: AOR,1.065; 95% CI, 1.061-1.069). For both preterm and full-term infants, ages 18 to 23 weeks were associated with the greatest odds of all-cause ED visits (AORs ranged from 1.034; 95% CI, 0.976-1.094 to 1.077; 95% CI, 1.022-1.135). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Increasing PM2.5 exposure was associated with an increased ED visit risk for both preterm and full-term infants during the first year of life, which may have implications for interventions aimed at minimizing air pollution.",JAMA NETWORK OPEN,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.0262,2,2,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper explores the possibilities for developing a proactive system, based on a machine-learning model (XGBoost), for predicting the occurrence of unwanted indoor environmental conditions: either a too high or a too low relative humidity, within the forthcoming 24Â h. The features used in the model were hourly indoor and outdoor climate recordings, and it was applied to two indoor heritage environments; a storage facility and a church building. The test accuracy (f1-score) of the model was good (0.93 for high RH; 0.93 for low RH) when applied to the storage building, but only 0.78; 0.62 (high RH; low RH) for the church building test. Challenges encountered include difficulties in obtaining good historical climate data sets for training and testing the model, and the dependency of external IT systems, which, if they fail, inactivates the model without a warning. Several issues call for more research: A desirable improvement of the model would be predictions for periods longer than 24Â h ahead, still maintaining a high test accuracy. Further perspectives of using machine learning for indoor environmental forecasting could be for indoor air pollution, or energy consumption due to climate control.

Air Pollution (AP) is one of the most significant global issues. Prevailing AP systems have low accuracy and require laboratory-based analysis. Therefore, improved prediction systems are needed. To overcome such problems, this paper proposes an IoT based efficient APprediction system utilizing the Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) classifier. Initially, the faulty node detection is done in the sensor nodes using the H-ANFIS algorithm. Here, ANFIS is hybridized with the K-Medoid algorithm. After that, the features are extracted from the sensed data and the unnecessary features are reduced by using the MPCA algorithm. Next, based on the reduced features, the data are balanced by using Entropy-HOA. Then, the balanced sensed data are pre-processed using replacing of missing attributes and HDFS. Next, the pre-processed data are tested with an AP prediction system employing the DLMNN classifier, where the Pity Beetle Algorithm (PBA) is used for weight optimization. Then, the predicted result is stored in the cloud server. Finally, the stored data is visualized. Experimental results have proved that the proposed system gives a better result than the existing systems.

Over the past decades, the frequency and intensity of wildfires has increased in many areas, resulting in longer smoke episodes with higher concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). There are also many communities where seasonal open burning and residential wood heating have short- and long-term impacts on ambient air quality. Understanding the acute and chronic health effects of biomass smoke exposure requires reliable estimates of PM2.5 concentrations during the wildfire season and throughout the year, particularly in areas without regulatory air quality monitoring stations. We have developed a machine learning approach to estimate PM2.5 across all populated regions of Canada from 2010 to 2019. The random forest machine learning model uses potential predictor variables integrated from multiple data sources and estimates daily mean (24-hour) PM2.5 concentrations at a 5 km Ã 5 km spatial resolution. The training and prediction datasets were generated using observations from National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between predicted and observed PM2.5 concentrations was 2.96 ?g/m3 for the entire prediction set, and more than 96 % of the predictions were within 5 ?g/m3 of the NAPS PM2.5 measurements. The model was evaluated using 10-fold, leave one-region-out, and leave-one-year-out cross-validations. Overall, CanOSSEM performed well but performance was sensitive to removal of large wildfire events such as the Fort McMurray interface fire in May 2016 or the extreme 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons in British Columbia. Exposure estimates from CanOSSEM will be useful for epidemiologic studies on the acute and chronic health effects associated with PM2.5 exposure, especially for populations affected by biomass smoke where routine air quality measurements are not available.

The opening state of the windows can modify the air exchange rate and as such the pollutant transfer between indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, we focus on the modeling of the windows opening state in a real open-plan office with five windows. For this purpose, three machine learning-based models were implemented: (i) Decision Tree, (ii) k-Nearest Neighbors and (iii) Kernel Approximation. IAQ, climatic parameters and the opening state of the windows have been monitored during an entire period of 18 months. The information about: (i) the environmental factors from the previous 24th hour and (ii) the current time (month, day of the week, hour of the day) was used to predict the current state of the windows. The predictor importance estimation and the calculated autocorrelation functions showed that the three most relevant factors were: the previous 24th hour of the windows status, the current time and the previous 24th hour of the prevailing mean outdoor air temperature. The three models perform well with the testing sets according to the different evaluation indicators. The developed methods can be helpful for understanding occupant behavior and also for controlling indoor air pollutants levels in buildings, either as a standalone model or a part of a real-time IAQ monitoring system.

Thus, ozone forecasting is a critical task that can help people avoid dangerously high ozone concentrations. Conventional numerical approaches, as well as data-driven forecasting approaches, have been studied for ozone forecasting. Data-driven forecasting models, in particular, have gained momentum with the introduction of machine learning advancements. We consider planetary boundary layer (PBL) height as a new input feature for data-driven ozone forecasting models. PBL has been shown to impact ozone concentrations, making it an important factor in ozone forecasts. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of utilization of PBL height on the performance of surface ozone forecasts. We present both surface ozone forecasting models, based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) and bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models. These two models forecast hourly ozone concentrations for an upcoming 24-h period using two types of input data, such as measurement data and PBL height. We consider the predicted values of PBL height obtained from the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, since it is difficult to gather actual PBL measurements. We evaluate two ozone forecasting models in terms of index of agreement (IOA), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). Results showed that the MLP-based and bidirectional LSTM-based models yielded lower MAE and RMSE when considering forecasted PBL height, but there was no significant changes in IOA when compared with models in which no forecasted PBL data were used. This result suggests that utilizing forecasted PBL height can improve the forecasting performance of data-driven prediction models for surface ozone concentrations.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/s22207864,2,1,Yes,"LSTM,MLP",,No,"South Korea,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three main results substantiate the importance of this research. First, the classification analysis corroborates the idea of a neutrality principle of road traffic on the target since the respective coefficient is significant, but quantitatively close to zero. This result, which may be the first sign of a paradigm shift regarding the adoption of electric vehicles in addition to reflect the success of previously implemented measures in the city of Lisbon, is reinforced by evidence that the carbon monoxide emitted mostly by diesel vehicles exhibits a significant, negative and permanent effect on satisfying the hourly limit value associated with the target. Second, robustness checks confirm that the period between 8 h and 16 h is particularly remarkable for influencing the target. Finally, the predictive exercise demonstrates that the internationally patented Variable Split Convolutional Attention model has the best predictive performance among several deep learning neural network alternatives. Results indicate that the concentration of nitrogen dioxide is expected to be volatile and only a redundant downward trend is likely to be observed. Therefore, in terms of policy recommendations, additional measures to avoid exceeding the legal nitrogen dioxide ceiling at the local level should be focused on reducing carbon monoxide emissions, rather than just being concerned about halting the intensity of road traffic.

The high infectivity of COVID-19 is primarily transmitted between people via respiratory droplets on contact routes, which makes it more difficult to prevent it. Air quality has been considered to be highly correlated with respiratory diseases. In addition, population movement increases contact routes, which increases the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks. For epidemic prevention, the governmentÂs strategies are also one of the factors that affect the risk of outbreaks, including whether it is mandatory to wear masks, stay-at-home orders, or vaccination. Wearing masks can reduce the risk of droplet infection, while stay-at-home orders can reduce contact between people. In this study, the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and active cases of COVID-19 will be estimated according to the population movement, outdoor air pollution, and vaccination rates. Using the estimated results, the average recovery time will be predicted by Queuing Theory. The predicted average recovery time will be brought into risk analysis to estimate the possible high-risk periods. We compare the estimated high-risk periods with epidemic-prevention measures to provide a reference to evaluate the epidemic prevention plans enforced by relevant government agencies to achieve an improved control measure over the epidemic situation.

Traditional pollutant control adopts post-treatment process to degrade the generated pollutants, but there is little research on controlling the generation of pollutants from the source. Therefore, starting from the source, this paper predicts the pollutants through the prediction model, so as to provide countermeasures for production regulation and avoiding excessive emission. In this paper, a pollution emission prediction method of CHP systems based on feature engineering and a hybrid deep learning model is proposed. Feature engineering performs multi-step preprocessing on the original data, refines the correlation factors, and removes redundant variables. The hybrid deep learning model has a multi-variable input and is established by combining the convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network with the attention mechanism. The case study is conducted on the collected actual dataset. The influence of the prediction target periodicity on the prediction results is analyzed seasonally to verify the effectiveness of the hybrid model. The results show that the root mean square error of the proposed method is less than one, and the error is reduced compared to the other basic methods, which proves the superiority of the proposed pollution emission prediction method over the existing methods.

In 2017, 77% of population of India were subjected to Particulate Matter (PM2.5) exposure, resulting in mortality of 6.7 lakh throughout the country. In this study, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a powerful deep learning technique, is applied for PM2.5 prediction. Three variants of LSTM model, LSTM for regression, LSTM for regression using window, and LSTM for regression with time steps, are developed to predict PM2.5 concentration in India. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the predictive models are root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The models are applied to continuous ambient air quality data collected from 14 stations in India, for the period from May 01, 2019, to April 30, 2020, at an interval of every 15 minutes. The optimal results are obtained from the models with the tuned parameters of 64 epochs and batch size of 32. All the three variants of LSTM model performed equally well in predicting PM2.5 concentration. The experimental results revealed that the value of R2 is maintained at 0.9 consistently for all the variants of LSTM model. The low values of RMSE and high values of R2 proved the reliability of the model. Thus, the proposed model gives awareness about the air pollution level in India and alerts the society to take precautionary steps to save their lives. Further, the urban planners can have an idea of the pollution levels for their planning and decision making. Â© 2022 University of Kuwait.

Diwali, a Hindu festival, coincides with these months where a large number of firecrackers are set off followed by high emissions of air pollutants. As a result, the air quality index (AQI) deteriorates to Âvery poorÂ (301 ? AQI ? 400) and ÂpoorÂ (201 ? AQI ? 300) categories. This situation stays for several days to a month. The present study aims to identify the thresholds for PM2.5 and PM10 that cause the AQI of Kolkata to deteriorate to Âvery poorÂ and Âpoor.Â For this purpose, we have used a rough set theory-based condition-decision support system to predict the aforementioned categories of AQI. We have developed a Z-number-based novel quantification measure of semantic information of AQI to assess the reliability of the outcomes, as generated from the condition-decision-based decision rules, during post-monsoon season. The result reveals the best possible forecast of AQI with linguistic summarization of the reliability or confidence for different threshold ranges of PM10 and PM2.5. Inverse-decision rules based on rough set theory are utilized to justify and validate the forecasts. The explainability of the condition-decision support system is demonstrated/visualized using a flow graph that maps rough-rule-based different decision paths between input and output with strength, certainty, and coverage. The investigation resulted in an advanced intelligent environmental decision support system (IEDSS) for air-quality prediction.

Spatially linking social and environmental exposures to electronic health records (EHR) can aid exposure assessment, epidemiology, and clinical treatment, but EHR data on exposures are missing for many children with asthma. To address the issue, we predicted presence of indoor asthma trigger allergens, and estimated effects of their key geospatial predictors. Methods: Our study samples were comprised of children with asthma who provided self-reported IHEE data in EHR at a safety-net hospital in New England during 2004Â2015. We used an ensemble machine learning algorithm and 86 multilevel features (e.g., individual, housing, neighborhood) to predict presence of cockroaches, rodents (mice or rats), mold, and bedroom carpeting/rugs in homes. We reduced dimensionality via elastic net regression and estimated effects by the G-computation causal inference method. Results: Our models reasonably predicted presence of cockroaches (area under receiver operating curves [AUC] = 0.65), rodents (AUC = 0.64), and bedroom carpeting/rugs (AUC = 0.64), but not mold (AUC = 0.54). In models adjusted for confounders, higher average household sizes in census tracts were associated with more reports of pests (cockroaches and rodents). Tax-exempt parcels were associated with more reports of cockroaches in homes. Living in a White-segregated neighborhood was linked with lower reported rodent presence, and mixed residential/commercial housing and newer buildings were associated with more reports of bedroom carpeting/rugs in bedrooms. Conclusions: We innovatively applied a machine learning and causal inference mixture methodology to detail IHEE among children with asthma using EHR and geospatial data, which could have wide applicability and utility.

This study proposed a technical framework and applied it to predict VI attenuation factors based on site-specific parameters recorded in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)Âs and the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA)Âs VI databases, which can overcome the limitations of traditional VI models. We examined the databases with multivariate analysis of variance to identify effective covariates, which were then employed to develop VI models with three machine learning algorithms. The results of multivariate analysis show that the effective covariates include soil texture, source depth, foundation type, lateral separation, surface cover, and land use. Based on these covariates, the predicted attenuation factors by these new models are generally within one order of magnitude of the observations recorded in the databases. Then the developed models were employed to generate the generic indoor attenuation factors to subsurface vapor (i.e., the 95th percentile of selected dataset), the values of which are different between the USEPA's and CalEPA's databases by one order of magnitude, although comparable to recommendations by the USEPA and literature, respectively. Such a difference may reflect the significant regional disparity in factors such as building structures or operational conditions (e.g., indoor air exchange rates), which necessitates generating generic VI attenuation factors on a state-specific basis. This study provides an alternative for VI risk screens on a site-specific basis, especially in states with a good collection of datasets. Although the proposed technical framework is used for the VI databases, it can be equally applied to other environmental science problems.

Research has been devoted to its clinical study but only a few studies have addressed the issue from a holistic perspective that included social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Therefore, in this study, risk factors or features, such as air pollution, tobacco use, socioeconomic status, employment status, marital status, and environment, were comprehensively considered when constructing a predictive model. These risk factors were analyzed and selected using stepwise regression and the variance inflation factor to eliminate the possibility of multicollinearity. To build efficient and informative prediction models of lung cancer incidence rates, several machine learning algorithms with cross-validation were adopted, namely, linear regression, support vector regression, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, and cubist model tree. A case study in Taiwan showed that the cubist model tree with feature selection was the best model with an RMSE of 3.310 and an R-squared of 0.960. Through these predictive models, we also found that apart from smoking, the average NO2 concentration, employment percentage, and number of factories were also important factors that had significant impacts on the incidence of lung cancer. In addition, the random forest model without feature selection and with feature selection could support the interpretation of the most contributing variables. The predictive model proposed in the present study can help to precisely analyze and estimate lung cancer incidence rates so that effective preventative measures can be developed. Furthermore, the risk factors involved in the predictive model can help with the future analysis of lung cancer incidence rates from a holistic perspective.

We installed a continuous air quality monitoring station in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and monitored several air pollutants and meteorological parameters over a 2-year period (2018Â2019). Here, we developed two supervised machine learning models, known as quantile regression mod-els, to analyze the whole distribution of the modeled pollutants, not only the mean values. Two pollutants, namely NO2 and O3, were modeled by dividing their concentrations into several quan-tiles (0.05, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 0.95) and the effect of several pollutants and meteorological variables was analyzed on each quantile. The effect of the explanatory variables changed at different segments of the distribution of NO2 and O3 concentrations. For instance, for the modeling of O3, the coefficients of wind speed at quantiles 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.95 were 1.40, 2.15, 2.34, 2.31, and 1.56, respectively.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that environmental parameters, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and vegetation, interact with air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), NO2, SO2, O3, and CO, contributing to frameworks for forecasting air quality. The objective of the present study is to explore these interactions in three Iranian metropolises of Tehran, Tabriz, and Shiraz from 2015 to 2019 and develop a machine learning-based model to predict daily air pollution. Three distinct assessment criteria were used to assess the proposed XGBoost model, including R squared (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Preliminary results showed that although air pollutants were significantly associated with meteorological factors and vegetation, the formulated model had low accuracy in predicting (R2PM2.5 = 0.36, R2PM10 = 0.27, R2NO2 = 0.46, R2SO2 = 0.41, R2O3 = 0.52, and R2CO = 0.38). Accordingly, future studies should consider more variables, including emission data from manufactories and traffic, as well as sunlight and wind direction. It is also suggested that strategies be applied to minimize the lack of observational data by considering second-and third-order interactions between parameters, increasing the number of simultaneous air pollution and meteorological monitoring stations, as well as hybrid machine learning models based on proximal and satellite data.

The accurate prediction of pollutant concentrations remains a challenging issue owing to the inherent complexity and volatility of pollutant series. In this study, a novel hybrid forecasting method for hourly pollutant concentration prediction that comprises a mode decomposition-recombination technique and a deep learning approach was designed. First, a Hampel filter was used to remove outliers from the original data. Subsequently, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is employed to divide the original pollution data into a finite set of intrinsic mode function (IMF) components. Further, a feature extraction method based on sample-fuzzy entropy and K-means is proposed to reconstruct the main features of IMFs. In conclusion, a deterministic forecasting model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) was established for pollutant prediction. The empirical results of six-hourly pollutant concentrations from Baoding illustrate that the proposed decomposition-recombination technique can effectively handle nonlinear and highly volatile pollution data. The developed hybrid model is significantly better than other comparative models, which is promising for early air quality warning systems.

Across the world, strategies aimed at quickly recognizing risk factors have also helped shape public health guidelines and direct resources; however, they are challenging to analyze and predict since those events still happen. This paper intends to invesitgate the association between air pollutants and COVID-19 confirmed cases using Deep Learning. We used Delhi, India, for daily confirmed cases and air pollutant data for the dataset. We used LSTM deep learning for training the combination of COVID-19 Confirmed Case and AQI parameters over the four different lag times of 1, 3, 7, and 14 days.

In this work, we have demonstrated a novel deep-learning method based on the wavelet covariance transform (WCT) for the PBLH evaluation from atmospheric lidar measurements. Lidar profiles are evaluated according to the WCT with a series of dilation values from 200 m to 505 m to generate 2-dimensional wavelet images. A large number of wavelet images and the corresponding PBLH-labelled images are created as the training set for a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is implemented based on a modified VGG16 (VGG - Visual Geometry Group) convolutional neural network. Wavelet images obtained from lidar profiles have also been prepared as the test set to investigate the performance of the CNN. The PBLH is finally retrieved by evaluating the predicted PBLH-labelled image and the wavelet coefficients. Comparison studies with radiosonde data and the Micro-Pulse-Lidar Network (MPLNET) PBLH product have successfully validated the promising performance of the deep-learning method for the PBLH retrieval in practical atmospheric sensing.

Recently, more and more machine-learning-based methods are being used to solve the air-quality-prediction problem, and gated recurrent units (GRUs) are a representative method because of their advantage for processing time-series data. However, in the same air-quality-prediction task, different researchers have always designed different structures of the GRU due to their different experiences. Data-adaptively designing a GRU structure has thus become a problem. In this paper, we propose an adaptive GRU to address this problem, and the adaptive GRU structures are determined by the dataset, which mainly contributes with three steps. Firstly, an encoding method for the GRU structure is proposed for representing the network structure in a fixed-length binary string; secondly, we define the reciprocal of the sum of the loss of each individual as the fitness function for the iteration computation; thirdly, the genetic algorithm is used for computing the data-adaptive GRU network structure, which can enhance the air-quality-prediction result. The experiment results from three real datasets in XiÂan show that the proposed method achieves better effectiveness in RMSE and SAMPE than the existing LSTM-, SVM-, and RNN-based methods.

Long-term exposure to constituents of air pollutants has exerted serious health implications in both humans and plants leading to a detrimental impact on economy. Among the pollutants contributing to air quality determination, particulate matter has been linked to serious health implications causing pulmonary complications, cardiovascular diseases, growth retardation and ultimately death. In agriculture, crop yield is also negatively impacted by the deposition of particulate matter on stomata of the plant which is alarming and can cause food security concerns. The deleterious impact of air pollutants on human health, agricultural and economic well-being highlights the importance of quantifying and forecasting particulate matter. Several deterministic and deep learning models have been employed in the recent years to forecast the concentration of particulate matter. Among them, deep learning models have shown promising results when it comes to modeling time series data and forecasting it. We have explored recurrent neural networks with LSTM model which shows potential to predict the particulate matter (PM2.5) based on multi-step multi-variate data of two of the most polluted regions of South Asia, Beijing, China and Punjab, Pakistan effectively. The LSTM model is tuned using Bayesian optimization technique to employ the appropriate hyper-parameters and weight initialization strategies based on the dataset. The model was able to predict PM2.5 for the next hour with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.1913 (91.5% accuracy) and this error gradually increases with the number of time steps with next 24 hours steps prediction having RMSE of 0.7290. While in case of Punjab dataset with data recorded once a day, the RMSE for the next day forecast is 0.2192. These multi-step short-term forecasts would play a pivotal role in establishing an early warning system based on the air quality index (AQI) calculated and enable the government in enacting policies to contain it.

However, whether air pollution affects implantation in frozen embryo transfer (FET) process is under debate. We aimed to find the association between ambient air pollution and implantation potential of FET and test the value of adding air pollution data to a random forest model (RFM) predicting intrauterine pregnancy. Using a retrospective study of a 4-year single-center design?we analyzed 3698 cycles of women living in Shanghai who underwent FET between 2015 and 2018. To estimate patientsÂ individual exposure to air pollution, we computed averages of daily concentrations of six air pollutants including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3 measured at 9 monitoring stations in Shanghai for the exposure period (one month before FET). Moreover, A predictive model of 15 variables was established using RFM. Air pollutants levels of patients with or without intrauterine pregnancy were compared. Our results indicated that for exposure periods before FET, NO2 were negatively associated with intrauterine pregnancy (OR: 0.906, CI: 0.816Â0.989). AUROC increased from 0.712 to 0.771 as air pollutants features were added. Overall, our findings demonstrate that exposure to NO2 before transfer has an adverse effect on clinical pregnancy. The performance to predict intrauterine pregnancy will improve with the use of air pollution data in RFM.

It plays an important role in the fields of air pollution, meteorology, weather forecasting, and climate. Continuous observation of lidar makes obtaining the dayÂnight PBL height (PBLH) with a high temporal resolution possible. A high-precision PBLH retrieval method is the key to achieving this goal. In this study, we propose a new method based on a bagged tree model to retrieve the PBLH from micro-lidar backscatter profiles. With the radiosonde measurements taken as the true reference, lidar features (the ten maximum slopes identified by the maximum gradient method) and four meteorological parameters (atmospheric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) serve as characteristic variables. The PBLH retrieval model is evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) method and then compared with the four traditional methods (i.e., maximum gradient, maximum standard deviation, wavelet covariance, and the ideal profile method). The correlation coefficient (R) between the retrieved PBLHs and the radiosonde measurements is 0.89, which is much bigger than the R (0.2Â0.48) from the four traditional methods. More-over, the root mean square error and mean absolute error for the retrieved PBLH are 0.3 km and 0.2 km, respectively, which are lower than those of the four traditional methods (0.5~0.6 km for RMSE and 0.4Â0.5 for MAE). Cases with different conditions show that this new method is almost undisturbed by cloud and suspended/thick aerosol layers. It can also be used to retrieve shallow PBL in cases in which using traditional methods would be difficult. Long-term analysis of averaged PBLHs retrieved by the proposed model from 2013 to 2016 shows that the hourly PBLH rises at sunrise and sets at sunset, and that the monthly PBLH in summer is higher than that in winter. The results suggest that the proposed method is better than the four traditional methods and available for use in conditions such as existing cloud layers and multiple-layers. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Precise prediction of air quality parameters can assist in the effective action of air pollution control and prevention. In this work, a deep learning framework is proposed to predict parameters such as fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based model that processes sequences in forward and backward direction to consider the influence of timesteps in both directions is employed. For further learning, unidirectional layers' stacking is implemented. The performance of the model is optimized by fine-tuning hyperparameters, regularization techniques for overfitting resolution, and various merging options for the bidirectional input layer. The proposed model achieves good optimization and performs better than the simple LSTM and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based model. Moreover, an attention-based mechanism is adopted to focus on more significant timesteps for prediction. The self-attention approach improves performance further and works well especially for longer sequences and extended time horizons. Experiments are conducted using real-world data collected, and results are evaluated using the mean square error loss function.

The PSDF model requires backward trajectories and sampling data at a receptor site in the calculation as in the conventional model to locate source areas of ambient trace species, such as the potential source contribution function (PSCF). The PSDF model can identify source areas quantitatively and provide information on the reliability of the estimation, while the PSCF model cannot. To verify and evaluate the capability of the PSDF model, tests are carried out using three scenarios based on ambient trajectory analysis data and simulated source distributions. The test results demonstrate that the PSDF model can identify the sources of ambient trace species more accurately than the PSCF model. The PSDF model can quantify the size of the source contaminating the air parcels passing through it, and the model can detect the variation of source intensity.

Like all models they suffer from errors, particularly systematic and location-specific representation errors. One way to reduce these errors is model output statistics (MOS) where the model output is fitted to observational data with machine learning. In this work, we assess the use of convolutional Deep Learning climate MOS approaches and present the ConvMOS architecture which is specifically designed based on the observation that there are systematic and location-specific errors in the precipitation estimates of climate models. We apply ConvMOS models to the simulated precipitation of the regional climate model REMO, showing that a combination of per-location model parameters for reducing location-specific errors and global model parameters for reducing systematic errors is indeed beneficial for MOS performance. We find that ConvMOS models can reduce errors considerably and perform significantly better than three commonly used MOS approaches and plain ResNet and U-Net models in most cases. Our results show that non-linear MOS models underestimate the number of extreme precipitation events, which we alleviate by training models specialized towards extreme precipitation events with the imbalanced regression method DenseLoss. While we consider climate MOS, we argue that aspects of ConvMOS may also be beneficial in other domains with geospatial data, such as air pollution modeling or weather forecasts.

Considerable research has been devoted to predicting instances of poor air quality, but most studies are limited by insufficient longitudinal data, making it difficult to account for seasonal and other factors. Several prediction models have been developed using an 8-year dataset collected by Beijing Environmental Protection Monitoring Center (BEPMC). The small spatial and temporal scales and nonlinearity of climate effects are significant challenges to precise Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. As a result, data normalization is applied to enhance air quality features without distorting divergences. Machine learning methods, including simple linear regression (SLR), support vector regressor (SVR), random forest (RF), and probabilistic voting ensemble, were used to build regression models for predicting the AQI of six central and outskirt regions of Beijing city. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the regression models. Experimental results showed that the max probabilistic voting ensemble performed better in the prediction of the AQI in terms of R2, whereas RF performed better in the prediction of the AQI in terms of MAE and RMSE scores.

The essential idea of this approach is to use the correlation degree between node information to fuse the spatial correlational feature and temporal correlational feature of air quality data to construct spatiotemporal graph structure data, which are used for anomaly detection in air quality data. In this proposed approach, (1) the weighted adjacency matrix is established to characterize the spatial correlation, and the feature matrix is constructed to characterize the temporal correlation; (2) changes in node information are transformed into changes in edge weights using the correlation degree between node information, and spatiotemporal graph structure data are constructed to characterize the spatiotemporal correlation; and (3) an advanced deep learning model, Context augmented Graph Autoencoder (Con-GAE), is utilized to handle the above spatiotemporal graph structure data and detect abnormal air quality events. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated by anomaly detection on synthetic test sets produced from real-world datasets.

Air pollution is a significant issue confronted by the environment particularly by highly populated countries like India. Due to increased population, the number of vehicles also continues to increase. Each vehicle has its individual emission rate; however, the issue arises when the emission rate crosses the standard value and the quality of the air gets degraded. Owing to the technological advances in machine learning (ML), it is possible to develop prediction approaches to monitor and control pollution using real time data. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics (BDA), there is a huge paradigm shift in how environmental data are employed for sustainable cities and societies, especially by applying intelligent algorithms. In this view, this study develops an optimal AI based air quality prediction and classification (OAI-AQPC) model in big data environment. For handling big data from environmental monitoring, Hadoop MapReduce tool is employed. In addition, a predictive model is built using the hybridization of ARIMA and neural network (NN) called ARIMA-NN to predict the pollution level. For improving the performance of the ARIMA-NN algorithm, the parameter tuning process takes place using oppositional swallow swarm optimization (OSSO) algorithm. Finally, Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) classifier is used to classify the air quality into pollutant and non-pollutant. A detailed experimental analysis is performed for highlighting the better prediction performance of the proposed ARIMA-NN method. The obtained outcomes pointed out the enhanced outcomes of the proposed OAI-AQPC technique over the recent state of art techniques. Â© 2022 Tech Science Press.

Overall, using wind to produce energy has fewer effects on the environment than many other energy sources. Wind and solar energy provide public health and environmental benefits to the social. Wind turbines may also reduce the amount of electricity generation from fossil fuels, which results in lower total air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. In order to better optimize the effect of social energy economic management and facilitate the multiobjective decision making of coordinated development of energy and socioeconomic environment, a modeling and analysis method of economic benefits of wind power generation based on deep learning is proposed. In this paper, based on the principle of deep learning, the evaluation indicators of wind power economic benefits are excavated, a scientific and reasonable economic benefit evaluation system is constructed, a wind power economic benefit analysis model supported by public management is constructed, and the steps of wind power economic benefit analysis are simplified. It is concluded that the modeling and analysis method of wind power economic benefits based on deep learning has high practicability in the actual application process, which is convenient for the prediction and analysis of energy demand for social and economic development.

This research work presents the modeling and analysis of cardiorespiratory mortality attributed to AP. The modeling and predictions are also completed using four Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for comparison. The AI techniques utilized for comparison are (1) Enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (ELSTM), (2) Vector Autoregressive (VAR) (3) Deep Learning (DL), and (4) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The research work is carried out at seven locations in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The five study locations i.e., Cheras, Petaling Jaya, Putrajaya, Shah Alam, and Klang have data from January 2006 to December 2016 and two relatively new monitoring stations, i.e., Banting and Batu Muda have data from April 2010 to December 2016 and January 2009 to December 2016, respectively.

In this study, we propose a new end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) for the retrieval of multiple atmospheric environmental parameters (RMEPs) from images. In contrast to other retrieval models, RMEP can retrieve a suite of atmospheric environmental parameters including atmospheric horizontal visibility, relative humidity (RH), ambient temperature, PM2.5, and PM10 simultaneously from a single image. Experimental results demonstrate that: 1) it is possible to simultaneously retrieve multiple atmospheric environmental parameters; 2) spatial and spectral resolutions of images are not the key factors for the retrieval on the horizontal scale; and 3) RMEP achieves the best overall retrieval performance compared with several classic CNNs such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-121, and the results are based on experiments on images extracted from webcams located in different continents (test 'R^{2}' values are 0.63, 0.72, and 0.82 for atmospheric horizontal visibility, RH, and ambient temperature, respectively).

To reduce the PM concentration, a remarkable amount of machine learning-based research has been proposed. However, increasing the accuracy of the predictions and providing clear interpretations of the predictions are challenging. In particular, no studies have addressed models that predict and interpret PM before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we present a two-step predictive and explainable model to obtain insights into reducing PM. We first use attentive multi-task learning to predict the air quality of cities. To accurately predict the concentration of particles with sizes of \sim 10~\mu ext{m}or \le 2.5~\mu ext{m}(PM10 and PM2.5, respectively), we demonstrate a performance difference between single-task and multi-task learning, as well as among the state-of-the art methods. The proposed attentive model with multi-task learning outperformed the others in terms of accuracy performance. We then used Shapley additive explanations, a representative explainable artificial intelligence framework, to interpret and determine the significance of features for predicting PM10 and PM2.5. We demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach in predicting and explaining both PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, and observed a statistically significant difference in air pollution before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To date, measurements of ALWC have been confined primarily to ground-based observations although vertical profiles of ALWC are crucial for understanding its interactions with meteorology. This study proposes a novel method for deriving profiles of ALWC using data acquired by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), a microwave radiometer, and a suite of aerosol instruments measuring aerosol physical and chemical properties, deployed during a five-month field experiment in Guangzhou, China. The retrieval approach is based on a machine-learning model named the gradient-boosted decision tree model. The inversion accuracy and stability are assessed through comparisons with ALWC data acquired on the ground and at the top of the Guangzhou tower of 532 m above ground. The agreements are encouraging: with the coefficient of determination ({R} {2}) = 0.870 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 3.28 \mu ext{g} \cdot m-3 for all data; {R} {2} = 0.776 and RMSE = 2.18 \mu ext{g} \cdot m-3 for tower data; and {R} {2} = 0.872 and RMSE = 4.1 \mu ext{g} \cdot m-3 for ground data. From the vertical distribution of the retrieved ALWC in Guangzhou, ALWC is higher in the lower boundary layer, especially when air pollution is severe. The proportion of liquid water in aerosol particles is closely related to the relative humidity in the environment, which will affect the morphology of aerosol particles (with about every 10% increase in liquid water, the depolarization ratio decreases by 0.02). The model may be of general use for studying air pollution and secondary aerosol generation.

We assess whether restrictions on human movement, particularly in blue-green spaces, affected the transmission of COVID-19. Our assessment uses a spatially resolved dataset of COVID-19 case numbers for 848 administrative units across 153 countries during the first year of the pandemic (February 2020 to February 2021). We measure mobility in blue-green spaces with planetary-scale aggregate and anonymized mobility flows derived from mobile phone tracking data. We then use machine learning forecast models and linear mixed-effects models to explore predictors of COVID-19 growth rates. After controlling for a number of environmental factors, we find no evidence that increased visits to blue-green space increase COVID-19 transmission. By contrast, increases in the total mobility and relaxation of other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as containment and closure policies predict greater transmission. Ultraviolet radiation stands out as the strongest environmental mitigant of COVID-19 spread, while temperature, humidity, wind speed, and ambient air pollution have little to no effect. Taken together, our analyses produce little evidence to support public health policies that restrict citizens from outdoor mobility in blue-green spaces, which corroborates experimental studies showing low risk of outdoor COVID-19 transmission. However, we acknowledge and discuss some of the challenges of big data approaches to ecological regression analyses such as this, and outline promising directions and opportunities for future research.

Recently, these methodologies have been combined to predict the influence of this pollutant on human health. However, traditional land-use regression models do not often consider the complex interactions between predictors, and most of these do not include socioeconomic variables. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to estimate suspended particle-related hospital admissions by employing remote sensing, meteorological, environmental, and demographic parameters. In this cohort study, we analyzed 1,612,049 hospital admissions from CÃ³rdoba city, Argentina, from 2005 to 2011, and developed several regression and machine learning land-use models to compare their predictive powers. We found that childhood was the age group with the highest number of hospital admissions related with upper respiratory tract diseases. When predicting population-normalized hospital admissions, the machine learning models, in particular the generalized boosted machine, revealed a better performance than regression models, exhibiting the lowest root mean square error (0.4264) in the test data set. This model also achieved the best R2adj (0.6088) when plotting predicted vs. reported normalized cases. The most important predictors were the meteorological variables, followed by the aerosol optical depth and the planet boundary layer height. Some other predictors, such as educational level, land value, and unsatisfied basic needs, showed less relevance but enhanced the model's prediction power. Furthermore, the predictive power increased after a 1-day lag in hospital admissions (RMSE = 0.4121), highlighting the importance of meteorological and environmental variables in the onset of respiratory diseases.

The first step consists of conventional linear models and supervised machine learning alternatives. Those regression methods do more than predict health outcomes in the EU-27 and relate those predictions to independent variables. Linear regression and its machine learning equivalents also inform unsupervised machine learning methods such as clustering and manifold learning. Lower-dimension manifolds of this datasetÂs feature space reveal the relationship among EU-27 countries and their success (or failure) in managing PM2.5 morbidity and mortality. Principal component analysis informs further interpretation of variables along economic and health-based lines. A nonlinear environmental Kuznets curve may describe the fuller relationship between economic activity and premature death from PM2.5 exposure.

Therefore, precise modeling techniques are necessary to predict air quality in congested areas such as megacities. Recently, machine learning algorithms such as Neural Networks show significant possibilities in air quality studies. This paper proposes a model to estimate air quality in a congested urban area in Baghdad city using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm and Geospatial Information System (GIS) techniques. Carbon Monoxide (CO) gas is selected as the main air pollutant. The model parameters involve; CO samples, traffic flow, weather data, and land use information collected in the field. The proposed model is implemented in Matlab environment and the results are processed after entering ArcGIS software. Using its spatial analysis tools, the outputs are presented as a map. The final findings indicate the highest value of CO emissions that reached 34 ppm during the daytime. The most polluted areas are located near congested roads and industrial locations in comparison with residential areas. The proposed model is validated by using actual values that are collected from the field, where the model's accuracy is 79%. The proposed model showed feasibility and applicability in a congested urban area due to the integration between the machine learning algorithm and GIS modeling. Therefore, the proposed model in this research can be used as a supportive model for decision making of city managers.

With the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, the natural environment has suffered some damages. In recent decades, the level of atmospheric visibility shows an overall downward trend. A decrease in atmospheric visibility will lead to a higher frequency of haze, which will seriously affect people's normal life, and also have a significant negative economic impact. The causal relationship mining of atmospheric visibility can reveal the potential relation between visibility and other influencing factors, which is very important in environmental management, air pollution control and haze control. However, causality mining based on statistical methods and traditional machine learning techniques usually achieve qualitative results that are hard to measure the degree of causality accurately. This article proposed the seq2seq-LSTM Granger causality analysis method for mining the causality relationship between atmospheric visibility and its influencing factors. In the experimental part, by comparing with methods such as linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, light gradient boosting machine, and extreme gradient boosting, it turns out that the visibility prediction accuracy based on the seq2seq-LSTM model is about 10% higher than traditional machine learning methods. Therefore, the causal relationship mining based on this method can deeply reveal the implicit relationship between them and provide theoretical support for air pollution control.

We obtain public health and ambient emission data from multiple sources in 2000Â2013 to model lung cancer in the period 2013Â2017. We compare several models using four sources of predictor variables: adult smoking, state, environmental quality index, and ambient emissions. The environmental quality index variables pertain to macro-level domains: air, land, water, socio-demographic, and built environment. The ambient emissions consist of Cyanide compounds, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Disulfide, Diesel Exhaust, Nitrogen Dioxide, Tropospheric Ozone, Coarse Particulate Matter, Fine Particulate Matter, and Sulfur Dioxide. We compare various models and find that the best regression model has variance explained of 62 percent whereas the best machine learning model has 64 percent variance explained with 10% less error. The most hazardous ambient emissions are Coarse Particulate Matter, Fine Particulate Matter, Sulfur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, and Tropospheric Ozone. These ambient emissions could be curtailed to improve air quality, thus reducing the incidence of lung cancer.

However, there is no API forecasting system available in Malaysia that can predict the coming day API readings. This paper aims to propose an API forecast system that utilizes the hourly API in Malaysia to predict the next day API.

Identification of trip mode distribution will allow transportation authorities to adopt appropriate strategies to reduce travel time, traffic, and air pollution.

However, human-selected features are sensitive to changes in traffic and environmental conditions and susceptible to personal biases, which can make them inefficient. One way to overcome these problems is to use neural networks capable of extracting high-level features from raw input. In this study, the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is used to predict the trip mode distribution based on raw GPS trajectory data. The key innovation of this paper is the design of the layout of the input layer of CNN as well as normalization operation, in a way that is not only compatible with the CNN architecture but can also represent the fundamental features of motion including speed, acceleration, jerk, and bearing rate.

While pollen concentrations are daily surveyed in most cities, data related to airborne bacteria or fungi are not usually available. This work presents the first effort to understand atmospheric pollution integrating both biotic and abiotic agents, trying to identify relationships among the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Ascomycota phyla with palynological, meteorological and air quality variables using all biological historical records available in the Madrid Greater Region. The tools employed involve statistical hypothesis contrast tests such as Kruskal-Wallis and machine learning algorithms. A cluster analysis was performed to analyse which abiotic variables were able to separate the biotic variables into groups. Significant relationships were found for temperature and relative humidity. In addition, the relative abundance of the biological phyla studied was affected by PM10 and O3 ambient concentration. Preliminary Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to predict the biotic relative abundances based on these atmospheric variables were developed. The results (r = 0.70) were acceptable taking into account the scarcity of the available data. These models can be used as an indication of the biotic composition when no measurements are available. They are also a good starting point to continue working in the development of more accurate models and to investigate causal relationships.

We compared multiple machine learning methods like artificial neural networks, support vector regression, decision tree regression, and extreme gradient boosting. We also investigated the effect of the pollution station and the meteorological station distance on the prediction result as well as explored the most relevant seasonal variables and the most important minimal set of features required for prediction to improve the prediction time.

Our results indicated that when the meteorological variables were obtained from the same pollution station the results were better. We were also able to reduce the time by reducing the set of variables required for prediction from 11 down to 3 and achieved major time improvement by about 80% for NO2, 92% for SO2, and 90% for PM10. The most important variables required for predicting NO2 were the previous day values of NO2, humidity and wind direction. While for SO2 they were the previous day values of SO2, temperature, and wind direction values of the previous day.

In this work, Random Forest (RF) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are used to analyze and predict air pollutants on the central island of the West Lake. We quantitatively demonstrate that the PM2.5 and PM10 were chiefly associated by the ups and downs of the gaseous air pollutants (SO2, NO2 and CO). Compared with the gaseous air pollutants, meteorological circumstances and regional transport played trivial roles in shaping PM. The predominant meteorological factor for SO2, NO2 and surface O3 was dew-point deficit. The proportion of sulfate in PM10 was higher than that in PM2.5. CO was strongly positively linked with PM. We discover that machine learning can accurately predict daily average wintertime SO2, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10, casting new light on the forecast and early warning of the high episodes of air pollutants in the future.

Nitrogen oxide (NOx) an is important factor which affects air pollution and is also the main gas emissions of the smoke and waste gas of FCC unit in petrochemical industry. It is important to accurately predict the NOx emission in advance for petrochemical industry to avoid air pollution incidents. In this paper, convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are combined to predict the NOx emission in Fluid Catalytic Cracking unit (FCC unit). Convolutional-LSTM (CLSTM) is able to extract the spatial and temporal features which are essential information in the prediction of the NOx emission. The features in the factors of production which would affect the NOx emission are extracted by CNN which prepares time series data for LSTM. The LSTM layer is connected after CNN to model the irregular trends in time series. CNN, Multi-layer perception (MLP), rand forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and LSTM are implemented as baseline models. The results from the proposed CLSTM model showed better performance than all the baseline models.

Currently, the core objective of air pollution control in China is to realize the joint treatment of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and O3. However, high-accuracy near-surface O3 maps remain lacking. Therefore, we established a new model to determine the full-coverage hourly O3 concentration with the WRF-Chem and random forest (RF) models combined with anthropogenic emission data and meteorological datasets. Based on this method, choosing the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in 2018 as an example, full-coverage hourly O3 maps were generated at a horizontal resolution of 9 km. The performance evaluation results indicated that the new model is reliable with a sample (station)-based 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) R2 value of 0.94 (0.90) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.58 (19.18) Âµg m?3. In addition, the estimated O3 concentration is accurately determined at varying temporal scales with sample-based 10-CV R2 values of 0.96, 0.98 and 0.98 at the daily, monthly, and seasonal scales, respectively, which is highly superior to traditional derivation algorithms and other techniques in previous studies. An initial increase and subsequent decrease, which constitute the diurnal variation in the O3 concentration associated with temperature and solar radiation variations, were captured. The highest concentration reached approximately 112.73 Â± 9.65 ?g m?3 at 15:00 local time (1500 LT) in the BTH region. Summertime O3 posed a high pollution risk across the whole BTH region, especially in southern cities, and the pollution duration accounted for more than 50% of the summer season. Additionally, 43 and two days exhibited light and moderate O3 pollution, respectively, across the BTH region in 2018. Overall, the new method can be beneficial for near-surface O3 estimation with a high spatiotemporal resolution, which can be valuable for research in related fields.

Several confounders (RH, T, light intensity, in chamber retention time) are controlled in chamber experiments to study their effect on the chemical transformation of a reactant (exposure variable) and the outcome [kinetic rate constant determination, new product/s formation e.g., secondary organic aerosol (SOA), product/s yield, etc.]. However, under ambient atmospheric conditions, it is not possible to control for these confounders which poses a challenge in assessing the outcome/s accurately. The approach of data interpretation must include randomization for an accurate prediction of the real-world scenario. One of the ways to achieve randomization is possible by the instrumental variable analysis (IVA). In this study, the IVA analysis revealed that the average ratio of fSOC/O3 (ppb?1) was 0.0032 (95% CI: 0.0009, 0.0055) and 0.0033 (95% CI: 0.0001, 0.0065) during daytime of Diwali and Post-Diwali period. However, during rest of the study period the relationship between O3 and fSOC was found to be insignificant. Based on IVA in conjunction with the concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT), cluster analysis, and fire count imageries, causal effect of O3 on SOA formation has been inferred for the daytime when emissions from long-range transport of biomass burning influenced the receptor site. To the best of our knowledge, the IVA has been applied for the first time in this study in the field of atmospheric and aerosol chemistry.

However, despite their success, most of the current data-driven solutions lack proper quantifications of model uncertainty that communicate how much to trust the forecasts. Recently, several practical tools to estimate uncertainty have been developed in probabilistic deep learning. However, there have not been empirical applications and extensive comparisons of these tools in the domain of air quality forecasts. Therefore, this work applies state-of-the-art techniques of uncertainty quantification in a real-world setting of air quality forecasts. Through extensive experiments, we describe training probabilistic models and evaluate their predictive uncertainties based on empirical performance, reliability of confidence estimate, and practical applicability. We also propose improving these models using ÂfreeÂ adversarial training and exploiting temporal and spatial correlation inherent in air quality data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed models perform better than previous works in quantifying uncertainty in data-driven air quality forecasts. Overall, Bayesian neural networks provide a more reliable uncertainty estimate but can be challenging to implement and scale. Other scalable methods, such as deep ensemble, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and stochastic weight averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), can perform well if applied correctly but with different tradeoffs and slight variations in performance metrics. Finally, our results show the practical impact of uncertainty estimation and demonstrate that, indeed, probabilistic models are more suitable for making informed decisions. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Two questions regarding SVOC reactivity with OH, NO3 and O3 in the gas and particle phases remain to be addressed: according to the existing measurements in the literature, which are the most reactive SVOCs in air, and how can the SVOC reactivity in the gas and particle phases be predicted? In the present study, a literature review of the second-order rate constant (k) was carried out to determine the SVOC reactivity with OH, NO3 and O3 in the gas and particle phases in ambient and indoor air at room temperature. Measured k values were available in the literature for 90 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organophosphates, dioxins, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and pesticides including pyrifenox, carbamates and terbuthylazine. PAHs and organophosphates were found to be more reactive than dioxins and PCBs. Based on the obtained data, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed to predict the k value using quantum chemical, molecular, physical property and environmental descriptors. Eight linear and nonlinear statistical models were employed, including regression models, bagging, random forest and gradient boosting. QSAR models were developed for SVOC/OH reactions in the gas and particle phases and SVOC/O3 reactions in the particle phase. Models for SVOC/NO3 and SVOC/O3 reactions in the gas phase could not be developed due to the lack of measured k values for model training. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and random forest models were identified as the most effective models for SVOC reactivity prediction according to a comparison of model performance metrics.

When analyzing air data, it is found that this type of data has not only temporal correlation, but also spatial correlation. For these temporal and spatial characteristics, this paper studies deep spatio-temporal learning method to global prediction. The purpose is to learn the evolution rule behind the spatio-temporal sequence, and give an estimation for future state. To be specific, we propose two novel forecasting models based on video processing technology: Spatio-temporal Orthogonal Cube model (STOR-cube) and Spatio-temporal Dynamic Advection model (ST-DA), which effectively capture the spatio-temporal correlation and accurately predict the long-term air quality. STOR-cube contains three branches, i.e., a spatial branch for capturing moving objects, a temporal branch for processing motion, and an output branch for coupling the first two mutually orthogonal branches to generate a prediction frame. ST-DA constructs a spatio-temporal reasoning network to learn the characteristics of the spatio-temporal domain, and its impact on the future is explicitly modeled by pixel motion. Experiments results on the real-world datasets demonstrate our proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.

Most of the existing PM2.5 concentration forecast methods lack the ability to model the dynamic temporal and spatial correlations of PM2.5 concentration. In an industrial park environment, in order to improve the accuracy of PM2.5 concentration forecast, based on deep learning technology, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph convolutional network based on the attention mechanism (STAM-STGCN) to solve the PM2.5 concentration forecast problem. When constructing the adjacency matrix, we not only use the Euclidean distance between sites but also consider the impact of wind fields and the impact of pollution sources near the nodes. In the process of model construction, we first use the spatiotemporal attention mechanism to capture the dynamic spatiotemporal correlations in PM2.5 data. In the spatiotemporal convolution module, we use graph convolutional neural networks to capture spatial features and standard convolution to describe temporal features. Finally, the output module adjusts the output shape of the data to produce the final forecast result. In this paper, the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as the performance evaluation metrics of the model, and the Dongmingnan Industrial Park atmospheric dataset is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that our STAM-STGCN model can more fully capture the spatial-temporal characteristics of PM2.5 concentration data; compared with the most advanced model in the comparison model, the RMSE can be improved about 24.2%, the MAE is improved about 35.8%, and the MAPE is improved about 34.6%.",WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING,10.1155/2021/7000986,2,1,Yes,"GCN,GRU,LSTM",,Yes,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in previous studies, new prediction algorithms have only been tested at stations or in a small region; a large-scale air quality forecasting model remains lacking to date. Huge dimensionality also means that redundant input data may lead to increased complexity and therefore the over-fitting of machine learning models. Feature selection is a key topic in machine learning development, but it has not yet been explored in atmosphere-related applications. In this work, a regional feature selection-based machine learning (RFSML) system was developed, which is capable of predicting air quality in the short term with high accuracy at the national scale. Ensemble-Shapley additive global importance analysis is combined with the RFSML system to extract significant regional features and eliminate redundant variables at an affordable computational expense. The significance of the regional features is also explained physically.

However, the conventional PM2.5 monitoring instruments used by the air quality monitoring stations are costly, bulkier, time-consuming, and power-hungry. Furthermore, due to limited data availability and non-scalability, it is challenging to provide high spatial and temporal resolution in real-time.

Public interest and concern over respiratory health are increasing in terms of a high reliability of a healthy life or the social sustainability of human beings. Air pollution can have various adverse or deleterious effects on human health. Respiratory diseases such as asthma, the subject of this study, are especially regarded as 'directly affected' by air pollution. Since such pollution is derived fromthe combined effects of atmospheric pollutants andmeteorological environmental factors, and it is not easy to estimate its influence on feasible respiratory diseases in various atmospheric environments. Previous studies have used clinical and cohort data based on relatively a small number of samples to determine how atmospheric pollutants affect diseases such as asthma. This has significant limitations in that each sample of the collections is likely to produce inconsistent results and it is difficult to attempt the experiments and studies other than by those in the medical profession. This study mainly focuses on predicting the actual asthmatic occurrence while utilizing and analyzing the data on both the atmospheric and meteorological environment officially released by the government. We used one of the advanced analytic models, often referred to as the vector autoregressivemodel (VAR),which traditionally has an advantage in multivariate time-series analysis to verify that each variable has a significant causal effect on the asthmatic occurrence. Next, the VAR model was applied to a deep learning algorithm to find a prediction model optimized for the prediction of asthmatic occurrence. The average error rate of the hybrid deep neural network (DNN)model was numerically verified to be about 8.17%, indicating better performance than other time-series algorithms. The proposedmodel can help streamline the national health andmedical insurance system and health budget management in South Korea much more effectively. It can also provide efficiency in the deployment andmanagement of the supply and demand ofmedical personnel in hospitals. In addition, it can contribute to the promotion of national health, enabling advance alerts of the risk of outbreaks by the atmospheric environment for chronic asthma patients. Furthermore, the theoretical methodologies, experimental results and implications of this study will be able to contribute to our current issues of global change and development in that the meteorological and environmental data-driven, deep-learning prediction model proposed hereby would put forward a macroscopic directionality which leads to sustainable public health and sustainability science.

While previous studies intensively evaluated air pollution episodes and extreme heat events, a limited number of studies comprehensively assessed atmospheric hot-and-polluted-episodes (HPE) - an episode with simultaneously high levels of air pollution and temperature - which have potential adverse synergic impacts on human health. This study focused on the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China due to its high temperature in summer and poor air quality throughout a year. We employed geostatistical downscaling to model meteorology at a spatial resolution of 1 km, and applied a machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) to estimate a high-resolution (1 km) daily concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) for June to October over 20 years (2000-2019). Our results indicate an increasing trend (similar to 50%) in the frequency of HPE occurrence in the first decade (2000-2010). Conversely, the annual frequency of HPE occurrence reduced (16.7%), but its intensity increased during the second decade (2010-2019). The northern cities in the PRD region had higher levels of PM2.5 and O-3 than their southern counterparts. During HPEs, regional daily PM2.5 exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese guideline levels by 75% and 25%, respectively, while the O-3 exceeded the WHO O-3 standard by up to 69%. Overall, 567,063 (95% confidence interval (CI): 510,357-623,770) and 52,231 (95%CI: 26,116-78,346) excessive deaths were respectively attributable to exposure to PM2.5 and O-3 in the PRD region. Our findings imply the necessity and urgency to formulate co-benefit policies to mitigate the region's air pollution and heat problems.",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119782,1,1,Yes,XGB,,Yes,"Peoples R China,Singapore",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The composition, distribution and size of these particles hazardously affect the human health causing cardiovascular health problems, lung dysfunction, respiratory problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lungs cancer. Classification models developed by analyzing mass concentration time series data of atmospheric particulate matter can be used for the prediction of air quality and for issuing warnings to protect the health of the public. In this study, mass concentration time series data of both outdoor and indoor particulates matters PM2.5 (aerodynamics size up to 2.5Â ?) and PM10.0 (aerodynamics size up to 10.0Â ?) were acquired using Haz-Dust EPAM-5000 from six different locations of the Muzaffarabad city, Azad Kashmir. The linear and nonlinear approaches were used to extract mass concentration time series features of the indoor and outdoor atmospheric particulates. These features were given as an input to the robust machine learning classifiers. The support vector machine (SVM) kernels, ensemble classifiers, decision tree and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) are used to classify the indoor and outdoor particulate matter time series. The performance was estimated in terms of area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, true negative rate, true positive rate, negative predictive value and positive predictive value. The highest accuracy (95.8%) was obtained using cubic and coarse Gaussian SVM along with the cosine and cubic KNN, while the highest AUC, i.e., 1.00, is obtained using fine Gaussian and cubic SVM as well as with the cubic and weighted KNN.

Often the air pollution and pollutant dispersion process depend on underlying meteorological conditions. Recently, Graph Neural Networks emerged as an effective deep learning model for discovering spatial patterns for various classification and regression tasks. This study proposes to employ a cluster-based Local Hybrid-Graph Neural Network (HGNN) methodology instead of using a single global Graph Neural Network for monitoring station-wise multi-step PM2.5 concentration forecasting across India's states. This methodology respects sudden changes in PM2.5 concentration due to the local meteorological variations. However, the local Hybrid GNN models consist of two parts: a spatio-temporal unit containing a Graph Neural Network layer along with a Gated Recurrent Unit layer to model the influence of wind speed and other meteorological variables on PM2.5 concentration. The other part is a station wise feature extraction unit to extract station-wise meteorological feature impact on PM2.5 concentration, along with the temporal dependency between historical records. The results from the two units are fused in step-wise manner for multi-step PM2.5 forecasting. The proposed methodology was used to develop separate PM2.5 concentration forecasting models, +24, +48 and +72 hours ahead. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is carried out to unfold the advantages of the proposed methodology.

In this work, a case study in wintry Hangzhou is made, for analysis of air pollutants and prediction of PM2.5/PM10 using two machine learning models, recurrent neural network (RNN) and random forest. The results signify that statistic-based and inventory-free machine learning is competently alternative to the inventory-predicted atmospheric models. Variable importance (VI) indicates that CO was the predominant factor for both PM2.5 and PM10. Dew-point deficit played an essential role in shaping gaseous air pollutants. Water vapor pressure and hydrostatic energy had trivial impact on atmospheric pollutants. RNN and random forest both show high accuracy in predicting PM2.5 and PM10. The inter-annual consistence of PMÂs components is confirmed. A method to pinpoint whether the high episodes of PM were spawned by long-range transport or increase of gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO2, and CO) is proposed.

It not only directly affects the environment and human health, but also influences the regional and even global climate by changing the atmospheric radiation budget, resulting in extensive and serious adverse effects. It is of great significance to accurately predict the concentration of pollutant. In this study, the domain knowledge of Atmospheric Sciences, advanced deep learning methods and big data are skillfully combined to establish a novel integrated model TSTM, derived from its fundamental features of Time, Space, Type and Meteorology, to achieve regional and multistep air quality forecast. Firstly, Expectation Maximization and Min-Max algorithms are used for the interpolation and normalization of data. Secondly, feature selection and construction are accomplished based on domain knowledge and correlation coefficient, and then Sliding Time Window algorithm is employed to build the supervised learning task. Thirdly, the features of pollution source and meteorological condition are learned and predicted by CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, the integrated model of convolutional neural network and Bidirectional long short-term memory network based on Sequence to Sequence framework with Attention mechanism, and then Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (ConvLSTM) integrates the two determinant features to obtain predicted pollutant concentration. The multiple-output strategy is also employed for the multistep prediction. Lastly, the forecast performance of TSTM for pollutant concentration, air quality and heavy pollution weather is tested systematically. Experiments are conducted in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Air Pollution Transmission Channel (Â2+26Â cities) of China for multistep prediction of hourly concentration of six conventional air pollutants. The results show that the performance of TSTM is better than other benchmark models especially for heavy pollution weather and it has good robustness and generalization ability.

It is practical application significance for how to establish a life model to evaluate the ECM of PCB under the interaction of soluble salt with temperature, relative humidity, and electric field strength. In this article, through the temperature humidity bias acceleration experiment, the ECM failure of PCB under the contamination of the different concentrations of NaCl solution is simulated, and the ECM characteristics and failure mechanism are studied through the change of surface insulation resistance (SIR) and the morphology and element compositions of migration products. The time to the insulation failure of PCB under different conditions are obtained by the analysis of SIR curves. Based on the data-driven method, the life modeling of ECM failure of PCB under soluble salt contamination is studied by multivariate non-linear regression and machine learning methods, such as support vector regression, gradient boost regression tree, and random forest regression.

Since their rapid spread can cause great distress to the real world, in addition to taking appropriate measures to curb the spread of infectious diseases in the event of an outbreak, proper prediction and early warning before the outbreak of the threat of infectious diseases can provide an important basis for early and reasonable response by the government health sector, reduce morbidity and mortality, and greatly reduce national losses. However, if only traditional medical data is involved, it may be too late or too difficult to implement prediction and early warning of an infectious outbreak. Recently, medical big data has become a research hotspot and has played an increasingly important role in public health, precision medicine, and disease prediction. In this paper, we focus on exploring a prediction and early warning method for influenza with the help of medical big data. It is well known that meteorological conditions have an influence on influenza outbreaks. So, we try to find a way to determine the early warning threshold value of influenza outbreaks through big data analysis concerning meteorological factors. Results show that, based on analysis of meteorological conditions combined with influenza outbreak history data, the early warning threshold of influenza outbreaks could be established with reasonable high accuracy.

As a result, the air pollution has become one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Therefore, an early cost-efficient warning system based on precise forecasting tools must be put in place to measure and avoid the harmful effects of exposure to the main air pollutants. Thus, it is essential to obtain reliable analytical information on air quality in a specific time and place. This paper focuses on monitoring air quality using a distributed intelligence which is a cost-efficient solution that enables a flexible prediction process distributed within a network of nodes and devices using a cross-platform solution. The suggested architecture enables collaborative learning along with collective knowledge graph building and knowledge sharing using the state of the art in Internet of Things, distributed machine learning, and ontologies. The proposed architecture suggests a flexible prediction system personalized for each node based on its need of information.

In this study, a multiple attention (MAT) mechanism based on multilayer perception, which includes monitoring site attention, time feature attention, and weather attention, was designed to obtain the spatial-temporal and meteorological dependences of PM2.5. A hybrid deep learning method based on MAT long short-term memory (MAT-LSTM) neural networks is proposed to predict PM2.5 concentration. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, hourly air pollution, and meteorological measurements were collected at 10 monitoring sites in Hefei City from May 13, 2014 to March 21, 2020. Comparison experiments were performed using the MAT-LSTM model, recurrent neural network (RNN), back propagation (BP), and LSTM neural network models. The comparison of the results demonstrated that the MAT-LSTM model was superior to the baseline models and achieved reductions of 86.44%, 69.64%, and 35.2% in the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared with RNN, BP, and LSTM, respectively.

(2) Methods: By selecting the air pollution complaint information in Beijing from 2019 to 2020, in this study, we extract the names and addresses of complaint points, as well as the complaint times and types by adopting the BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) + CRF (conditional random field) model deep learning method. Moreover, through further filtering and processing of the complaint points' address information, we achieve address matching and spatial positioning of the complaint points, and realize the regional spatial representation of air pollution complaints in Beijing in the form of a heat map. (3) Results: The experimental results are compared and analyzed with the ranking data of total suspended particulate (TSP) concentration of townships (streets) in Beijing during the same period, indicating that the key areas of air pollution complaints have a high correlation with the key polluted township (street) areas. The distribution of complaints and the types of complaints in each township (street) differ according to the population density in each township (street), the level of education, and economic activity. (4) Conclusions: The results of this study show that the public, as the intuitive perceiver of air pollution, is sensitive to the air pollution situation at a smaller spatial scale; furthermore, complaints can provide guidance and reference for the direction of air pollution control and law enforcement investigations when coupled with geographical features and economic status.",ATMOSPHERE,10.3390/atmos13071023,1,1,No,,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the actual intra-pandemic weighted mean GTSVs were compared to the intra-pandemic forecasts, the actual values were lower by -16.5% (SARIMA's error = 6.2%). Compared to the pre-pandemic period, in the intra-pandemic period, the number of search queries containing keywords connected with air pollution decreased. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic might have facilitated the decrease.

Several diseases such as asthma and cardiovascular conditions are becoming more diffuse, due to a rise in pollution exposure and a more sedentary lifestyle. Healthcare providers deal with increasing new challenges, and thanks to fast-developing big data technologies, they can be faced with systems that provide direct support to citizens. In this context, within the EU-funded Participatory Urban Living for Sustainable Environments (PULSE) project, we are implementing a data analytic platform designed to provide public health decision makers with advanced approaches, to jointly analyze maps and geospatial information with healthcare and air pollution data. In this paper we describe a component of such platforms, which couples deep learning analysis of urban geospatial images with healthcare indexes collected by the 500 Cities project. By applying a pre-learned deep Neural Network architecture, satellite images ofNewYork City are analyzed and latent feature variables are extracted. These features are used to derive clusters, which are correlated with healthcare indicators by means of a multivariate classification model. Thanks to this pipeline, it is possible to show that, in New York City, health care indexes are significantly correlated to the urban landscape.

The nodes in the cell are assumed to generate data samples periodically, which are to be transmitted to the AP. The AP hosts a machine learning model, such as a neural network, which is trained on the received data samples to make accurate inferences. We address the following tradeoff: The more often the IoT nodes transmit, the higher the accuracy of the inference made by the AP, but also the higher the energy expenditure at the IoT nodes. We propose distributed importance filtering, a scheme employed by the IoT nodes to filter out the redundant data and reduce the number of irrelevant transmissions. The IoT nodes do not have large on-device machine learning models and the data filtering scheme operates under periodic instructions from the model placed at the AP. The proposed scheme is evaluated using neural networks on a benchmark machine vision dataset, as well as in two practical scenarios: leakage detection in water distribution networks and air-pollution detection in urban areas. The results show that the proposed scheme offers significant benefits in terms of network longevity as it preserves the devices' resources, whilst maintaining high inference accuracy.

In addition to reducing truck fuel consumption and air pollution by reducing air resistance, effective platoon strategies can also maximize highway throughput while improving driving safety. However, the truck platoon strategy's current resource allocation model is still in the preliminary research stage. Therefore, inspired by the successful experience of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in solving resource allocation problems, this article proposes a dynamic resource allocation model for the truck platoon based on the semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) and DRL, which is used to maximize system revenue when considering the resource cost and income balance of the transportation system. Precisely, the proposed method first models the process of controlling the dynamic in and out of the truck platoon as SMDP. The action value in a specific state obtained by the planning algorithm is used as a DRL sample for model training. Finally, the SMDP is optimized through the trained model to obtain a truck platoon resource that approximates the optimal strategy distribution plan.

Now the effects of air pollutants on tumors in the airways, kidneys, bladder, breast, and colon have been investigated and are better understood. It is now known that particulates in air pollution can cross the blood-brain barrier and also reach the placenta. The aim of this study was to find a possible relationship between the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere and the formation of specific types of tumors in the Polish population. Two databases available on the Internet were used in the analysis: the bank of measurement data on air quality in Poland (the repository of Environmental Protection Inspection) and cancer statistics. The pollution measurement data for the years 2000-2016 were taken from the Chief Inspectorate for Environmental Protection website, a database with results from 264 stations located in Poland for 13 types of gases and atmospheric pollutants. Statistical data on cancer C00-D09 (according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10)) in the Polish population in the years 1999-2015 were retrieved from onkologia.org.pl. A novel code was constructed, allowing the downloading of statistics from the databases, examination of their correlation, and selection of the best model of regression through machine learning.

As carpooling solutions become more popular, they need to be implemented efficiently. Data analytics can help people make informed decisions when selecting a ride (Car or Bus). We applied machine learning algorithms to select the desired ride (Car or Bus) and used feature ranking algorithms to identify the foremost traits for selecting the desired ride.

To test the applicability of the framework, a large-scale experiment is carried out with the real-world dataset collected from New South Wales, Australia. Experimental results validate that the proposed framework provides a stable forecasting result, it confirms that the AQI of a place gets affected by the pollutant concentration of the nearby places and the comparison of forecasting result with the existing state of the art models shows that the proposed model outperforms the other models.

We developed an Artificial Neural Network Sequential Downscaling Method (ASDM) with Transfer Learning Enhancement (ASDMTE) to translate time-series data from coarse- to fine-scale while maintaining between-scale empirical associations as well as inherent within-scale correlations. Using assimilated aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) (2 years, daily, 7 km resolution) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) (20 years, daily, 50 km resolution), coupled with elevation (1 km resolution), we demonstrate the downscaling capability of ASDM and ASDMTE and compare their performances against a deep learning downscaling method, Super Resolution Deep Residual Network (SRDRN), and a traditional statistical downscaling framework called dissever ASDM/ASDMTE utilizes empirical between-scale associations, and accounts for within-scale temporal associations in the fine-scale data. In addition, within-scale temporal associations in the coarse-scale data are integrated into the ASDMTE model through the use of transfer learning to enhance downscaling performance. These features enable ASDM/ASDMTE to be trained on short periods of data yet achieve a good downscaling performance on a longer time-series.

This will aid in decreasing the time required to supply any type of service, as well as lowering the emissions produced by automobiles, allowing our planet to recover from air pollution emissions. The proposed model is a variation of the pointer networks that has a better ability to encode the TSPTW problems. The model proposed in this paper is inspired from our previous work that introduces a hybrid context encoder and a multi attention decoder. The hybrid encoder primarily comprises the transformer encoder and the graph encoder; these encoders encode the feature vector before passing it to the attention decoder layer. The decoder consists of transformer context and graph context as well. The output attentions from the two decoders are aggregated and used to select the following step in the trip. To the best of our knowledge, our network is the first neural model that will be able to solve medium-size TSPTW problems.

The modeling and reliable prediction of air quality remain substantial challenges because uncertainties residing in emissions data are unknown and the dynamic processes are not well understood. A number of machine learning approaches have been used to predict air quality to help alleviate air pollution, since accurate air quality estimation may result in significant social-economic development. From this perspective, a novel air quality estimation approach is proposed, which consists of two components: newly-designed dendritic neural regression (DNR) and customized scale-free network-based differential evolution (SFDE). The DNR can adaptively utilize spatio-temporal information to capture the nonlinear correlation between observations and air pollutant concentrations. Since the landscape of the weight space in DNR is vast and multimodal, SFDE is used as the optimization algorithm due to its powerful search ability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide stable and reliable performances in the estimation of both PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, being significantly better than several commonly-used machine learning algorithms, such as support vector regression and long short-term memory.

However, the environmental benefits of electric heating are restrained by regional resources endowment and regional electrical energy structure. In the context of the active promotion of electric heating in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the paper studied the development potential and limits of wind power electric heating under the constraints of environmental effects to provide reference for the orderly development of electric heating. A model to predict the capacity of the installed wind power improved by the fruit fly optimized ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) algorithm and an electric heating environment effect calculation model are constructed. The optimal value and critical value of the newly added heating area in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei are obtained through calculation under four scenarios of wind abandonment rate. As the wind abandonment rate increases from 4-10% (with interval of 2%), the optimal value of the newly added electric heating area in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei will be 19.15, 29.47, 36.26, and 47.90 million m(2) by the year 2030. Additionally, as the utilization rate of thermal power exceeds 41.16%, electric heating will produce more carbon emissions compared to coal-fired heating. Therefore, if we want to develop electric heating on a large scale, we need to control the proportion of thermal power in the power supply structure and increase the proportion of new energy. This study can be used as theoretical reference to the development programme of electric energy substitution in the future.

Therefore, multiple systems have been developed for early prediction of air pollution levels in large cities. However, deterministic models produce uncertainties due to the complexity of the physical and chemical processes of individual systems and transport. In turn, statistical and machine learning techniques require a large amount of historical data to predict the behavior of a variable. In this paper, we propose a data fusion model to spatially and temporally predict air quality and assess its situation and risk for public health. Our model is based on the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) model and focused on Information Quality (IQ), which allows us to fine tune hyper-parameters in different processes and trace information from raw data to knowledge. Expert systems use the information assessment to select and process data, information, and knowledge. The functionality of our model is tested using an environmental database of the Air Quality Monitoring Network of Ãrea Metropolitana del Valle de AburrÃ¡ (AMVA in Spanish) in Colombia. Different levels of noise are added to the data to analyze the effects of information quality on the systems' performance throughout the process. Finally, our system is compared with two conventional machine learning-based models: Deep Learning and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The results show that our proposed model exhibits better performance, in terms of air quality forecasting, than conventional models.

Research on utilizing various data sources, such as remote sensing and in situ sensors, for PM2.5 concentrations modeling remains a hot topic. In this study, the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) is used as a supplementary weather data source, along with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), solar angles, and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES16) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) to model high spatial-temporal PM2.5 concentrations. PM2.5 concentrations as well as in situ weather condition variables are collected from the 31 sensors that are deployed in the Dallas Metropolitan area. Four machine learning models with different predictor variables are developed based on an ensemble approach. Since in situ weather observations are not widely available, ECMWF is used as an alternative data source for weather conditions in studies. Hence, the four established models are compared in three groups. Both models in this first group use weather variables collected from deployed sensors, but one uses NEXRAD and the other does not. In the second group, the two models use weather variables retrieved from ECMWF, one using NEXRAD and one without. In the third group, one model uses weather variables from ECMWF, and the other uses in situ weather variables, both without NEXRAD. The first two environmental groups investigate how NEXRAD can enhance model performances with weather variables collected from in situ observations and ECMWF, respectively. The third group explores how effective using ECMWF as an alternative source of weather conditions. Based on the results, the incorporation of NEXRAD achieves an R-2 score of 0.86 and 0.83 for groups 1 and 2, respectively, for an improvement of 2.8% and 9.6% over those models without NEXRAD. For group three, the use of ECMWF as an alternative source of in situ weather observations results in a 0.13 R-2 drop. For PM2.5 estimation, weather variables including precipitation, temperature, pressure, and surface pressure from ECMWF and deployed sensors, as well as NEXRAD velocity, are shown to be significant factors.",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs14030495,2,1,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in early 2020 led to substantial reductions in hospital admissions, but the specific contribution of changes in air quality through this natural experiment has not been examined. Capitalizing on the timing of the stay-at-home order, we quantified the specific contribution of fine-scale changes in PM2.5 concentrations to reduced respiratory emergency department (ED) visits in the pediatric population of San Diego County, California. We analyzed data on pediatric ED visits (n = 72,333) at the ZIP-code level for respiratory complaints obtained from the ED at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego County (2015-2020) and ZIP-code level PM(2.5 )from an ensemble model integrating multiple machine learning algorithms. We examined the decrease in respiratory visits in the pediatric population attributable to the stay-at-home order and quantified the contribution of changes in PM2.5 exposure using mediation analysis (inverse of odds ratio weighting). Pediatric respiratory ED visits dropped during the stay-at-home order (starting on 19 March 2020) Immediately after this period, PM2.5 concentrations, relative to the counterfactual values based in the 4-year baseline period, also decreased with important spatial variability across ZIP codes in San Diego County. Overall, we found that decreases in PM2.5 attributed to the stay-at-home order contributed to explain 4% of the decrease in pediatric respiratory ED visits. We identified important spatial inequalities in the decreased incidence of pediatric respiratory illness and found that brief decline in air pollution levels contributed to a decrease in respiratory ED visits.

Results To answer the former question, we utilized 6 months of state employment level data from California, United States, as a method of gauging the economic health of agency-regulated industries. We implemented a machine learning model to predict weekly employment data and a t-test to indicate any significant changes in employment. We found that, following California's state-issued stay-at-home order and the agency's regulation suspension, oil and certain manufacturing industries had statistically significant lower employment values. To answer the latter question, we used 10 years of PM2.5 levels in California, United States, as a metric for local air quality and treatment-control county pairs to isolate the impact of regulation rollbacks from the impacts of the state lockdown. Using the agency's data, we performed a t-test to determine whether treatment-control county pairs experienced a significant change in PM2.5 levels. Even with the statewide lockdown-a measure we hypothesized would correlate with decreased mobility and pollution levels-in place, counties with oil refineries experienced the same air pollution levels when compared to historical data averaged from the years 2009 to 2019. Conclusions In contrast to the expectation that the suspension would improve the financial health of the oil and manufacturing industry, we can conclude that these industries are not witnessing economic growth with the suspension and state shutdown in place. Additionally, counties with oil refineries could be taking advantage of these rollbacks to continue emitting the same amount of PM2.5, in spite of state lockdowns. For these reasons, we ask international policymakers to reconsider the suspension of enforcement regulations as these actions do not fulfill their initial expectations. We recommend the creation and maintenance of pollution control and prevention programs that develop emission baselines, mandate the construction of pollution databases, and update records of pollution emissions.",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,10.1186/s12302-021-00489-9,3,1,No,,,,"United States,Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, traditional methods, such as deterministic and statistical approaches, have large prediction errors and cannot provide effective information to prevent the negative effects of air pollution. Therefore, few existing methods could obtain accurate air pollutant time series predictions. To this end, a deep learning-based air pollutant prediction method, namely, the autocorrelation error-Informer (AE-Informer) model, is proposed in this study. The model implements the AE based on the Informer model. The AE-Informer model is used to predict the hourly concentrations of multiple air pollutants, including PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and O3. The experimental results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values of AE-Informer in multivariate prediction are 3% less than those of the Informer model; thus, the prediction error is effectively reduced. In addition, a stacking ensemble model is proposed to supplement the missing air pollutant time series data.

Therefore, mathematical models that do not relate the source to the air quality do not offer guidance on how to regulate the air quality. This is often due to a lack of information about sources or a limited budget to measure emissions from sources that are expected to have a major contribution. A proxy for emission rate was used in modeling to improve the prediction of pollutant concentration and to investigate major sources. The daily average air concentration of NO2 and SO2 were predicted at five different locations using supervised machine learning methods, including random forests and support vector machines regression. Three models were constructed using different combinations of features. In model I, only features relating to the weather were used. Model II used only features of the types and quantities of fossil fuels consumed by power plants, which serve as a proxy for emission rates. In model III, all features from models I and II were used. Model III was found to be the most accurate. The average improvement in R2 for NO2 and SO2 regressions for all sites and using both methods were between 61% and 33%, respectively. This improvement in the prediction indicates that power plants are major sources and contribute significantly to the ambient level of SO2 and NO2 levels. The relative importance of all fuel consumption features was found to be comparable to the value of all weather features. The relative importance values of the fuel consumption features show an opportunity to improve air quality by burning a quantity of fuel in a power plant that has a smaller relative importance value instead. However, whether the receptors are located in rural or urban areas must be considered to maximize the net benefits. © 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Kuwait University.

Static stations typically collect air pollution data by utilizing a small number of costly and high-quality sensors and numerous low-cost micro stations. However, data collected from micro stations usually suffers from large noise and thus calibration would be necessary for operating good air pollution governance. Point-to-point models and sequence-to-point models have the potential limitations of either failing to mine latent patterns embedded in historical time series or ignoring spatial dependency within a certain region. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called Spatio-Temporal Calibration Model (STCM) based on dual encoders. STCM consists of long-term encoder, short-term encoder, and decoder modules. The long-term encoder encodes historical reference data via GRU and extracts the trend, periodicity, and adjacency of the target pollutant through a temporal attention mechanism. The short-term encoder then reflects real-time conditions through a spatial attention mechanism, quantifying dynamic station-wise correlations between micro stations and the static station. The decoder ultimately integrates outputs of dual encoders and generates calibration results of all micro stations. STCM has been experimentally justified by comparing against nine baseline methods based on two real-world datasets. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Information Sciences,10.1016/j.ins.2023.119307,1,1,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, policymakers in cities worldwide seek to improve bicycle mode shares. Efforts to increase the bicycle's mode share involve many measures, one of them being the improvement of cycling safety often requiring an analysis of the factors surrounding accidents. However, meaningful analysis of cycling safety requires accurate bicycle flow data that are generally sparse or only available at the aggregate level. Therefore, safety engineers often rely on aggregated variables or calibration factors that fail to account for variations in the cycling traffic relevant to policymaking. This paper illustrates how machine learning can support policy analysis by delivering detailed bicycle flow predictions. The illustration applies a Deep Learning approach, the Long Short-Term Memory Mixture Density Network (LSTMMDN), to estimate hourly bicycle flow in Copenhagen, conditional on weather, temporal and road conditions at the segment level. The method addresses some shortcomings in the calibration factor method resulting in 66–77% more accurate bicycle traffic estimates. To quantify the impact of more accurate bicycle traffic estimates in cycling safety analysis, we test the effect of different flow estimates in a bicycle crash risk model, i.e. the models are identical except for the exposure variables. One model is estimated using the LSTMMDN estimates, one using the calibration-based estimates, and one using yearly mean traffic estimates. The results show that investing in more advanced methods for obtaining bicycle volume estimates can improve the quality of safety analyses and other performance measures. © 2023 The Author(s)",Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103783,1,1,No,,,,Denmark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, this paper proposes a methodology to develop a data-driven model for predicting the level of indoor air quality and thermal comfort in naturally ventilated educational buildings, and identifies the key influential factors. The model was developed using the class-weighted random forest algorithm with data collected from a large measurement campaign. The developed model demonstrated good accuracy, generalization ability, and robustness. The analysis concluded that occupancy, windows and doors operation, and outdoor environmental parameters are key factors must be involved, whereas building characteristics have no practical contribution to the prediction. The model inputs are easily accessible data for schools. Once the model is developed with data collected from an initial measurement campaign in representative educational buildings, it can be used in all local schools without requiring monitoring sensor networks, thereby rendering a “cost-effective” way of assessing indoor air quality and thermal comfort to help relevant stakeholders improve building management practices in schools. © 2023 The Authors",Journal of Building Engineering,10.1016/j.jobe.2023.108001,1,1,No,,,,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate prediction of PM2.5 (a category of particulate pollutant with a diameter of less than 2.5μm) has been a critical topic, as it can provide valuable information for government decision-making and policy control in environmental management affairs. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the next 48hr PM2.5 concentration in Taiwan. In this model, monitoring stations are regarded as nodes and edges are the distances between monitoring stations. Hence, the distribution of the stations can be perceived as a graph. GNNs are promising in processing non-grid structure data that can be represented as a graph. By incorporating the GNN and gated recurrent units (GRUs), this model can effectively capture the long-term spatial–temporal features in air quality time-series data. In addition, we also investigated the problem of predicting PM2.5 concentrations in the areas without monitoring stations or at sites far away from the stations. This problem has not captured researchers’ attention whose methods are based on GNN. The problem is, however, quite challenging as these areas do not have historical air quality data, leading to low prediction quality. Finally, we performed experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model based on actual data sources obtained in Taiwan. The results show that the proposed model exhibits satisfactory prediction performance compared to existing models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Expert Systems with Applications,10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121074,1,1,Yes,GNN,,Yes,Taiwan,forecast,PM25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long and short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are integrated to create a CNN-LSTM time series prediction model to predict the concentration of PM2.5 and its chemical components (i.e., heavy metals, carbon component, and water-soluble ions) using meteorological data and air pollutants (PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3). In the integrated CNN-LSTM model, the CNN uses convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from the data, whereas the powerful nonlinear mapping and learning capabilities of LSTM enable the time series prediction of air pollution. The experimental results showed that the CNN-LSTM exhibited good generalization ability in the prediction of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn, with a mean R2 above 0.9. Mean R2 predicted for PM2.5, Pb, Ti, EC, OC, SO42−, and NO3− ranged from 0.85 to 0.9. Shapley value showed that PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO had a greater influence on the predicted heavy metal results of the model. Regarding water-soluble ions, the predicted results were dominantly influenced by PM2.5, CO, and humidity. The prediction of the carbon fraction was affected mainly by the PM2.5 concentration. Additionally, several input variables for various components were eliminated without affecting the prediction accuracy of the model, with R2 between 0.70 and 0.84, thereby maximizing modeling efficiency and lowering operational costs. The fully trained model prediction results showed that most predicted components of PM2.5 were lower during January to March 2020 than those in 2018 and 2019.

Due to rapid expansion in commercial social, and economic aspects, the pollutant concentrations in different parts of the world continue to increase and disrupt human life. Thus, monitoring the pollutant levels is of primary importance to keep the pollutant concentrations under control. Regular monitoring enables the authorities to take appropriate measures in case of high pollution. However, monitoring the pollutant concentrations is not straightforward as it requires installing monitoring stations to collect the relevant pollutant data, which comes with high installation and maintenance costs. In this research, an attempt has been made to simulate the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 at two sites in Stuttgart (Marienplatz and Am Neckartor) using Machine Learning methods. These pollutants are measured with the help of monitoring stations at these locations. Five Machine Learning methods, namely ridge regressor, support vector regressor, random forest, extra trees regressor, and xtreme gradient boosting, were adopted for this study. Meteorological parameters, traffic data, and pollutant information from nearby monitoring stations for the period from January 01, 2018 to 31.03.2022 were considered as inputs to model the pollutants. From the results, it was concluded that the pollutant information from the nearby stations has a significant effect in predicting the pollutant concentrations. Further, it was investigated if a similar methodology can be applied at other locations to estimate pollutant concentrations. This procedure was tested on the data of the monitoring station Karlsruhe-Nordwest which is located in another German city named Karlsruhe. The results demonstrated that this method is applicable in other areas as well. © 2023 The Authors",Atmospheric Environment,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119987,1,1,Yes,"RR,SVR,RF,ERT,GBELM",,Yes,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to evaluate the sociodemographic, lifestyle, and environmental determinants associated with circulating vitamin D levels in Spanish pregnant women. Methods: We used data from the Spanish INMA (“Infancia y Medio Ambiente”) prospective birth cohort study from the regions of Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, and Valencia. 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) was measured in plasma collected in the first trimester of pregnancy. Information on 108 determinants was gathered: 13 sociodemographic, 48 lifestyle including diet, smoking and physical activity, and 47 environmental variables, representing the urban and the chemical exposome. Association of the determinants with maternal 25(OH)D3 levels was estimated in single- and multiple-exposure models. Machine learning techniques were used to predict 25(OH)D3 levels below sufficiency (30 ng/mL). Results: The prevalence of < 30 ng/mL 25(OH)D3 levels was 51 %. In the single-exposure analysis, older age, higher socioeconomic status, taking vitamin D, B12 and other sup*plementation, and higher humidity, atmospheric pressure and UV rays were associated with higher levels of 25(OH)D3 (IQR increase of age: 1.2 [95 % CI: 0.6, 1.8] ng/mL 25(OH)D3). In the multiple-exposures model, most of these associations remained and others were revealed. Higher body mass index, PM2.5 and high deprivation area were associated with lower 25(OH)D3 levels (i.e., Quartile 4 of PM2.5 vs Q1: −3.6 [95 % CI: −5.6, −1.5] ng/mL of 25(OH)D3). History of allergy and asthma, being multiparous, intake of vegetable fat, vitamin B6, alcohol consumption and molybdenum were associated with higher levels. The machine learning classification model confirmed some of these associations. Conclusions: This comprehensive study shows that younger age, higher body mass index, higher deprived areas, higher air pollution and lower UV rays and humidity are associated with lower 25(OH)D3 levels. © 2023",Environment International,10.1016/j.envint.2023.108293,1,1,No,,,,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Air quality, however, is difficult to predict due to the complex dynamics, and its accurate forecast still remains a challenge. This study suggests a spatiotemporal Informer model, which uses a new spatiotemporal embedding and spatiotemporal attention, to improve AQI forecast accuracy. In the first phase of the proposed forecast mechanism, the input data is transformed by the spatiotemporal embedding. Next, the spatiotemporal attention is applied to extract spatiotemporal features from the embedded data. The final forecast is obtained based on the attention tensors. In the proposed forecast model, the input is a 3-dimensional data that consists of air quality data (AQI, PM2.5, O3, SO2, NO2, CO) and geographic information, and the output is a multi-positional, multi-temporal data that shows the AQI forecast result of all the monitoring stations in the study area. The proposed forecast model was evaluated by air quality data of 34 monitoring stations in Beijing, China. Experiments showed that the proposed forecast model could provide highly accurate AQI forecast: the average of MAPE values for from 1 h to 20 h ahead forecast was 11.61%, and it was much smaller than other models. Moreover, the proposed model provided a highly accurate and stable forecast even at the extreme points. These results demonstrated that the proposed spatiotemporal embedding and attention techniques could sufficiently capture the spatiotemporal correlation characteristics of air quality data, and that the proposed spatiotemporal Informer could be successfully applied for air quality forecasting. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122402,1,1,Yes,STI,,Yes,"China,North Korea",forecast,AQI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite extensive research on HONO observation in recent years, knowledge regarding its sources and sinks in urban areas remains inadequate. In this study, we monitored the atmospheric concentrations of HONO and related pollutants, including gaseous nitric acid and particulate nitrate, simultaneously at a supersite in downtown Chengdu, a megacity in southwestern China during spring, when was chosen due to its tolerance for both PM2.5 and O3 pollution. Furthermore, we employed the random forest model to fill the missing data of HONO, which exhibited good predictive performance (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 0.36 ppbv). During this campaign, the average mixing ratio of HONO was measured to be 1.0 ± 0.7 ppbv. Notably, during periods of high O3 and PM2.5 concentrations, the mixing ratio of HONO was >50 % higher compared to the clean period. We developed a comprehensive parameterization scheme for the HONO budget, and it performed well in simulating diurnal variations of HONO. Based on the HONO budget analysis, we identified different mechanisms that dominate HONO formation at different times of the day. Vehicle emissions and NO2 heterogeneous conversions were found to be the primary sources of HONO during nighttime (21.0 %, 30.2 %, respectively, from 18:00 to 7:00 the next day). In the morning (7:00–12:00), NO2 heterogeneous conversions and the reaction of NO with OH became the main sources (35.0 %, 32.2 %, respectively). However, in the afternoon (12:00–18:00), the heterogeneous photolysis of HNO3 on PM2.5 was identified as the most substantial source of HONO (contributing 52.5 %). This study highlights the significant variations in primary HONO sources throughout the day. © 2023",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166605,1,1,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The airborne pollutants have been a major threat in Delhi both in the past and coming years. The air quality index is a figure, based on the cumulative effect of major air pollutant concentrations, used by Government agencies, for air quality assessment. Thus, the main aim of the present study is to predict the daily AQI one year in advance through three different neural network models (FF-NN, CF-NN and LR-NN) for the year 2020 and compare them. The models were trained using AQI values of previous year (2019). In addition to main air pollutants like PM10/PM2.5, O3, SO2, NOx, CO and NH3, the non-criteria pollutants and meteorological data were also included as input parameter in this study. The model performances were assessed using statistical analysis. The key air pollutants contributing to high level of daily AQI were found to be PM2.5/PM10, CO and NO2. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of 31.86 and 28.03 were obtained for the FF-NN and CF-NN models respectively whereas the LR-NN model has the minimum RMSE value of 26.79. LR-NN algorithm predicted the AQI values very closely to the actual values in almost all the seasons of the year. The LR-NN performance was also found to be the best in post-monsoon season i.e., October and November (maximum R2 = 0.94) with respect to other seasons. The study would aid air pollution control authorities to predict AQI more precisely and adopt suitable pollution control measures.

Traditionally, statistical models have been used to model heat-health relationships, but they do not consider potential interactions between temperature-related and air pollution predictors. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods, which have gained popularity for health applications in recent years, can account for these complex and non-linear interactions, but have been underutilized in modelling heat-related health impacts. In this paper, six machine and deep learning models were considered to model the heat-mortality relationship in Montreal (Canada) and compared to three statistical models commonly used in the field. Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Single- and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (SLP and MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Generalized Linear and Additive Models (GLM and GAM), and Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model (DLNM) were employed. Heat exposure was characterized by air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, while air pollution was also included in the models using five pollutants. The results confirmed that air temperature at lags of up to 3 days was the most important variable for the heat-mortality relationship in all models. NO2 concentration and relative humidity (at lags 1 to 3 days) were also particularly important. Ensemble tree-based methods (GBM and RF) outperformed other approaches to model daily mortality during summer months based on three performance criteria. However, a partial validation during two recent major heatwaves highlighted that non-linear statistical models (GAM and DLNM) and simpler decision tree may more closely reproduce the spike of mortality observed during such events. Hence, both machine learning and statistical models are relevant for modelling heat-health relationships depending on the end user goal. Such extensive comparative analysis should be extended to other health outcomes and regions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164660,1,1,No,,,,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many deep learning and mode decomposition techniques have been explored to capture the temporal and nonlinear features of PM2.5 concentration data. However, most of the existing methods ignore the differences in prediction losses of individual subsequences, resulting in lower prediction accuracy. To address this limitation, we proposed an ensemble gated recurrent unit (GRU) model that incorporated a self-weighted total loss function based on variational mode decomposition (VMD). In this approach, the PM2.5 concentration series were decomposed using the VMD, and then each decomposed subsequence (including the residual sequence) was fed into the GRU and the predicted loss of the subsequence was then calculated. For the model to output optimal predictions, we used a self-weighted ensemble loss function to adaptively optimize the prediction loss for each subsequence. Specifically, larger weights were assigned to the model's subsequences with higher predictive losses to better focus on those with higher predictive losses. In addition, the hyperparameter of the model was adjusted to adapt to various datasets in different domains. Experimental results on the three datasets show that our model performs better than the VMD-GRU and single GRU models. This validates the effectiveness of our model. Our approach has the advantage of plug-and-play, making it easier to seamlessly integrate deep learning techniques and pattern decomposition methods into air quality prediction. © 2023",Ecological Indicators,10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111138,1,1,Yes,GRU,ENS,,China,forecast,PM25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, aerosol optical depth (AOD) offers high resolution and wide coverage, making it a viable way to estimate PM concentrations. Recent years have also witnessed in-creasing promise in refining air quality predictions via deep neural network (DNN) models, out-performing other techniques. However, learning the weights and biases of the DNN is a task classified as an NP-hard problem. Current approaches such as gradient-based methods exhibit significant limitations, such as the risk of becoming ensnared in local minimal within multi-objective loss functions, substantial computational requirements, and the requirement for continuous objective functions. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines the binary gray wolf optimizer (BGWO) with DNN to improve the optimization of models for air pollution prediction. The BGWO algorithm, inspired by the behavior of gray wolves, is used to optimize both the weight and bias of the DNN. In the proposed BGWO, a novel sigmoid function is proposed as a transfer function to adjust the position of the wolves. This study gathers meteorological data, topographic information, PM10 pollution data, and satellite images. Data preparation includes tasks such as noise removal and handling missing data. The proposed approach is evaluated through cross-validation using metrics such as correlation rate, R square, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and accuracy. The effectiveness of the BGWO-DNN framework is compared to seven other machine learning (ML) models. The experimental evaluation of the BGWO-DNN method using air pollution data shows its superior performance compared with traditional ML techniques. The BGWO-DNN, CapSA-DNN, and BBO-DNN models achieved the lowest RMSE values of 16.28, 19.26, and 20.74, respectively.

Additionally, the correlation between predicted and actual values shows that the proposed model surpasses the performance of other ML techniques.

However, due to the mobility and dynamics of pollution sources, meteorological conditions, and transformation processes, pollutant concentration predictions are characterized by great uncertainty and instability, making it difficult for existing prediction models to effectively extract spatial and temporal correlations. In this paper, a powerful pollutant prediction model (STA-ResConvLSTM) is proposed to achieve accurate prediction of pollutant concentrations. The model consists of a deep learning network model based on a residual neural network (ResNet), a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, and a convolutional long short-term memory neural network (ConvLSTM). The spatial-temporal attention mechanism is embedded in each residual unit of the ResNet to form a new residual neural network with the spatial-temporal attention mechanism (STA-ResNet). Deep extraction of spatial-temporal distribution features of pollutant concentrations and meteorological data from several cities is carried out using STA-ResNet. Its output is used as an input to the ConvLSTM, which is further analyzed to extract preliminary spatial-temporal distribution features extracted from the STA-ResNet. The model realizes the spatial-temporal correlation of the extracted feature sequences to accurately predict pollutant concentrations in the future.

This approach presents certain limitations when it comes to deeply mining the joint influence of multiple monitoring sites and their inherent connections with meteorological factors. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative deep-learning-based multi-graph model using Beijing as the study case. This model consists of two key modules: firstly, the 'Meteorological Factor Spatio-Temporal Feature Extraction Module'. This module deeply integrates spatio-temporal features of hourly meteorological data by employing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for spatial and temporal encoding respectively. Subsequently, through an attention mechanism, it retrieves a feature tensor associated with air pollutants. Secondly, these features are amalgamated with PM2.5 concentration values, allowing the 'PM2.5 Concentration Prediction Module' to predict with enhanced accuracy the joint influence across multiple monitoring sites. Our model exhibits significant advantages over traditional methods in processing the joint impact of multiple sites and their associated meteorological factors. By providing new perspectives and tools for the in-depth understanding of urban air pollutant distribution and optimization of air quality management, this model propels us towards a more comprehensive approach in tackling air pollution issues. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Environmental Research,10.1016/j.envres.2023.117286,1,1,Yes,"GNN,CNN,LSTM",ENS,yes,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also directly affects fuel consumption, traffic flow, public health, and air pollution along with psychology and personal mental health. For advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) and autonomous vehicles, predicting driver behavior helps to facilitate interaction between ADAS and the human driver. Consequently, driver behavior prediction has emerged as an important research topic and has been investigated largely during the past few years. Often, the investigations are based on simulators and controlled environments. Driving behavior can be inferred using control actions, visual monitoring, and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This study leverages the IMU data recorded using a smartphone placed inside the vehicle. The dataset contains the accelerometer and gyroscope data recorded from the real traffic environment. Extensive experiments are performed regarding the use of a different set of features, the combination of original and derived features, and binary versus multiclass classification problems; a total of six scenarios are considered. Results reveal that 'timestamp' is the most important feature and using it with accelerometer and gyroscope features can lead to a 100% accuracy for driver behavior prediction. Without using the 'timestamp' feature, the number of wrong predictions for 'slow' and 'normal' classes is high due to the feature space overlap. Although derived features can help elevate the performance of the models, the models show inferior performance to that of using the 'timestamp' feature. Deep learning models tend to show poor performance than machine learning models where random forest and extreme gradient boosting machines show a 100% accuracy for multiclass classification. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",IEEE Sensors Journal,10.1109/jsen.2023.3256000,1,1,No,,,,"Pakistan,Ireland,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accurate prediction of air quality is crucial to enable management authorities and vulnerable populations to take measures to minimize their exposure to hazardous pollutants. Although many methods have been developed to predict air quality data, the spatio-temporal correlation of air quality data is complex and nonstationary, which makes air quality prediction still challenging. To address this, we propose a novel spatio-temporal neural network, GCNInformer, that combines the graph convolution network with Informer to predict air quality data. GCNInformer incorporates information about the spatial correlations among different monitoring sites through GCN layers and acquires both short-term and long-term temporal information in air quality data through Informer layers. Moreover, GCNInformer uses MLP layers to learn low-dimensional representations from meteorological and air quality data. These designs give GCNInformer the ability to capture the complex and nonstationary relationships between air pollutants and their surrounding environment, allowing for more accurate predictions. The experimental results demonstrate that GCNInformer outperforms other methods in predicting both short-term and long-term air quality data. Thus, the use of GCNInformer can provide useful information for air pollutant prevention and management, which can greatly improve public health by alerting individuals and communities to potential air quality hazards. © 2023 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su15097624,1,1,Yes,"GNN,CNN",ENS,yes,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In total, 1,086 patients with CRSwNP were recruited from nine hospitals in China during 2014–2019. The average annual concentrations of ambient PMs before surgery were assessed using satellite-based daily concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 for a 1 × 1-km2 area. Linear regression and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations of PM exposure with eosinophilia and risks of eosinophilic CRSwNPs. In addition, mediation effect analysis was used to validate the interrelationships of the aforementioned factors. Finally, machine learning algorithms were used to predict the recurrence risks of CRSwNPs. Results: There was a significantly increased risk of eosinophilic CRSwNPs with each 10 μg/m3 increase in PMs, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.039 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.007–1.073) for PM10 and 1.058 (95% CI = 1.007– 1.112) for PM2.5. Eosinophils had a significant mediation effect, which accounted for 52% and 35% of the relationships of CRSwNP recurrence with PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. Finally, we developed a naïve Bayesian model to predict the risk of CRSwNP recurrence based on PM exposure, inflammatory data, and patients’ demographic factors. Conclusions: Increased PM exposure is associated with an increased risk of eosinophilic CRSwNP in China. Therefore, patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP should reduce PM exposure to mitigate its harmful impacts. © 2023",Environment International,10.1016/j.envint.2023.108031,1,1,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate air pollution forecasting can help people to reduce exposure risks and promote environmental pollution control, and it is also an extremely important part of smart city management. However, the current deep-learning-based models for air pollution forecasting usually focus on prediction accuracy improvement without considering the model interpretability. These models usually fail to explain the complex relationships between prediction targets and external factors (e.g., ozone concentration (O (Formula presented.)), wind speed, temperature variation, etc.) The relationships between variables in air pollution time series prediction problems are very complex, with intricate relationships between different types of variables, often with nonlinear multivariate dependencies. To address these problems mentioned above, we proposed a hybrid autoformer network with a genetic algorithm optimization to predict air pollution temporal variation as well as establish interpretable relationships between pollutants and external variables. Furthermore, an elite variable voting operator was designed to better filter out more important external factors such as elite variables, so as to perform a more refined search for elite variables. Moreover, we designed an archive storage operator to reduce the effect of neural network model initialization on the search for external variables. Finally, we conducted comprehensive experiments on the Ma’anshan air pollution dataset to verify the proposed model, where the prediction accuracy was improved by 2–8%, and the selection of model influencing factors was more interpretable. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14050869,1,1,Yes,TNN,ENS,yes,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban air quality is pivotal, given its impact on health, necessitating accurate pollutant forecasting and emission reduction strategies to ensure overall well-being. This study forecasts the influence of green energy transport systems on the air quality in Lahore and Islamabad, Pakistan, while noting the projected surge in electric vehicle adoption from less than 1% to 10% within three years. Predicting the impact of this change involves analyzing data before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown led to minimal fossil fuel vehicle usage, resembling a green energy transportation scenario. The novelty of this work is twofold. Firstly, remote sensing data from the Sentinel-5P satellite were utilized to predict air quality index (AQI) trends before, during, and after COVID-19. Secondly, deep learning models, including long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM, and machine learning models, including decision tree and random forest regression, were utilized to forecast the levels of NO (Formula presented.), SO (Formula presented.), and CO in the atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that implementing green energy transportation systems in urban centers of developing countries can enhance air quality by approximately 98%. Notably, the bidirectional LSTM model outperformed others in predicting NO (Formula presented.) and SO (Formula presented.) concentrations, while the LSTM model excelled in forecasting CO concentration.

However, environmental concerns, such as air pollution from fossil fuels, are becoming limiting factors for energy sources. Therefore, the appropriate and sustainable solution is to transition towards renewable energy sources to meet global energy demands by using environmentally friendly sources, such as geothermal. The Harrat Rahat volcanic field, located in the western region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), gets more attention due to its geothermal potential as a viable site for geothermal energy exploration due to its high enthalpy. The prime objective of this study is to present up-to-date and comprehensive information on the utilization of borehole temperature and remote sensing data to identify the most prospective zones with significant geothermal activity favorable for exploration and drilling. A brief description of the selected wells and the methodology used to determine the petrophysical parameters relevant to the geothermal potential assessment are presented.

Moreover, models for predicting visibility are lacking due to the lack of accurate visibility observations to verify. This study formulated an artificial intelligence method for measuring atmospheric visibility in five topographical regions: hills, basins, plains, alluvial plains, and rift valleys. Four air pollution factors and five meteorological factors were selected as independent variables for predicting visibility by using three artificial intelligence models, namely a support vector machine (SVM) model, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, and an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model. The GridSearchCV function was used to automatically tune model hyperparameters to determine the optimal parameter values of the three models for the five target areas. The predictions of the aforementioned three models underwent considerable considerably scale shrinking relative to observed values. The inappropriately low predicted visibility values might have been caused by the use of inaccurate observations for training. To solve this problem, formulas of scale ratio and downshift were used to adjust the predicted values. Statistical measurements of model performance measures by five quantitative methods (e.g., correlation coefficient, mean absolute error) showed that adjusted predictions were in strong agreement with the observation data for the five target areas. Therefore, the adjusted prediction has high reliability. Because of obvious differences in the topography, weather, and air quality of the five target areas, different models provided optimal predictions for different areas. In densely populated western Taiwan, the MLP model is most suitable for predicting visibility on hills whereas the XGBoost model is most suitable for predicting visibility on basins and plains. In eastern Taiwan, the SVM model is most suitable for predicting visibility on alluvial plains and rift valleys. Thus, the optimal prediction model should be identified according to the conditions in each area. These results can inform decision-making processes or improve visibility predicting in specific areas. © 2023 The Authors",Heliyon,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e19281,1,1,No,,,,Taiwan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For all the error metrics considered in this work, namely MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, HETL outperformed the baseline models including standalone and conventional transfer learning strategies. Transfer learning, coupled with hybrid ensemble techniques, can ensure favorable transfer performance, even if source and target offices lack data.

Objective: This study integrated multiple approaches to develop new models to estimate within-city spatial variations in annual median (i.e. average) outdoor UFP and BC concentrations as well as mean UFP size in Canada's two largest cities, Montreal and Toronto. Methods: We conducted year-long mobile monitoring campaigns in each city that included evenings and weekends. We developed generalized additive models trained on land use parameters and deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models trained on satellite-view images. Using predictions from these models, we developed final combined models. Results: In Toronto, the median observed UFP concentration, UFP size, and BC concentration values were 16,172pt/cm3, 33.7 nm, and 1225 ng/m3, respectively. In Montreal, the median observed UFP concentration, UFP size, and BC concentration values were 14,702pt/cm3, 29.7 nm, and 1060 ng/m3, respectively. For all pollutants in both cities, the proportion of spatial variation explained (i.e., R2) was slightly greater (1–2 percentage points) for the combined models than the generalized additive models and a greater (approximately 10 percentage points) than the deep CNN models. The Toronto combined model R2 values in the test set were 0.73, 0.55, and 0.61 for UFP concentrations, UFP size, and BC concentration, respectively. The Montreal combined model R2 values were 0.60, 0.49, and 0.60 for UFP concentration, UFP size, and BC concentration models respectively. For each pollutant, predictions from the combined, deep CNN, and generalized additive models were highly correlated with each other and differences between models were explored in sensitivity analyses.

However, several natural and artificial aspects such as fog and air pollution make it difficult to extract correct geometric information. To overcome the limitation of optical images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images can be used to access more accurate information with respect to the targeted area. In this manner, optical and SAR images can be utilized together to detect the scale of change even in bad weather conditions. To process optical and SAR images, an image translation process-oriented Deep Adaptation-based Change Detection Technique (DACDT) is proposed. An optimized U-Net++ model is proposed that helps to improve the global and regional impacts of the images. Moreover, a multi-scale loss function is utilized to access the features of different dimensions. In this manner, the final change maps are generated by transferring the features of optical images to the SAR images for better change analysis.

Here, the hyperparameters of the LSTM model, such as the number of layers, number of neurons, number of epochs, and kernel size, are optimized to achieve the highest prediction rate. Against this backdrop, the present study uses for the first time a hybrid GA-LSTM model to predict PM_2.5 concentrations in Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, and London. The Beijing dataset consists of 13 attributes, the Shanghai dataset consists of 10 attributes, the London dataset consists of 5 attributes, and the Singapore dataset consists of 7 attributes. In this study, input variables such as PM_2.5, DEWP, TEMP, PRESS, WS, WD, PRE, Snowfall hours, Rain hours, and Season were used. To assess the effectiveness of this hybrid method, the developed GA-LSTM model was compared with k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), LSTM, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Experimental results showed that GA-LSTM outperformed the compared models. In addition, one of the best results was obtained compared to other models in the literature. © 2023 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",Atmospheric Pollution Research,10.1016/j.apr.2023.101836,1,1,Yes,LSTM,ENS,,"Turkey,Saudi Arabia,Australia,Spain",prediction,PM25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A gap-filling model was first adopted to impute the missing NO2 column densities from satellite, then an ensemble machine learning model incorporating three base learners was developed to estimate the spatiotemporal pattern of monthly mean NO2 concentrations at 0.05° spatial resolution from 2005 to 2020 in China. Further, we applied the exposure data set with epidemiologically derived exposure response relations to estimate the annual NO2 associated mortality burdens in China. The coverage of satellite NO2 column densities increased from 46.9% to 100% after gap-filling. The ensemble model predictions had good agreement with observations, and the sample-based, temporal and spatial cross-validation (CV) R2 were 0.88, 0.82, and 0.73, respectively. In addition, our model can provide accurate historical NO2 concentrations, with both by-year CV R2 and external separate year validation R2 achieving 0.80. The estimated national NO2 levels showed a increasing trend during 2005–2011, then decreased gradually until 2020, especially in 2012–2015. The estimated annual mortality burden attributable to long-term NO2 exposure ranged from 305 thousand to 416 thousand, and varied considerably across provinces in China. This satellite-based ensemble model could provide reliable long-term NO2 predictions at a high spatial resolution with complete coverage for environmental and epidemiological studies in China. Our results also highlighted the heavy disease burden by NO2 and call for more targeted policies to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides in China. © 2023 The Authors.

It is very important to establish high-precision and high-performance air quality prediction models and take corresponding control measures. In this paper, based on 4 years of air quality and meteorological data from Tianjin, China, the relationships between various meteorological factors and air pollutant concentrations are analyzed. A hybrid deep learning model consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) is proposed to predict pollutant concentrations. In addition, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal combination of hyperparameters for the proposed deep learning model, which enhances the generalization ability of the model. Furthermore, based on air quality data from multiple stations in the region, a multistation collaborative prediction method is designed, and the concept of a strongly correlated station (SCS) is defined. The predictive model is modified using the idea of SCS and is used to predict the pollutant concentration in Tianjin. The coefficient of determination R 2 of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 are 0.89, 0.84, 0.69, 0.83, 0.92, and 0.84, respectively.

The present study is part of a collective effort that begun in recent years to evaluate the efficiency of these techniques involving a large range of measurements to trace the source signals. Here we explore the possibilities provided by the very simple but robust k-near-neighbors algorithm (kNN) for classification in a source-to-sink approach. For this purpose, in a first phase, the magnetic properties of the traffic-related sources of particulate matter (tire, brake pads, exhaust pipes, etc.) are used to parameterize and train the model. Then, the magnetic parameters measured on accumulating surfaces exposed to a polluted air as urban plant leaves and passive filters are confronted to the model. The results are very encouraging. The algorithm predicts the dominant traffic-related sources for different kinds of accumulative surfaces. The model predictions are generally consistent according to the sampling locations. Its resolution seems adequate since different dominant sources could be identified within one street. We demonstrate the possibility to trace traffic-derived pollutants from sources to sinks based only on magnetic properties, and to eventually quantify their contributions in the total magnetic signal measured. Because magnetic mapping has a high-resolution efficiency, these results open the opportunity to complement conventional methods used to measure air quality and to improve the numerical models of pollutant dispersion. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Environmental Research,10.1016/j.envres.2023.116006,1,1,No,,,,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This planning should be based on a unified classification model, which evaluates the conditions of different municipal assets (i.e., water and sewer pipes and road pavements) at the segment-level. The objectives of this paper are: (1) Developing a machine learning method for systematic condition classification of different spatially collocated underground municipal assets within a segment; and (2) Applying a heuristic approach for determining street closures based on the synchronized or unsynchronized interventions at the segment level induced from combining the interventions of individual assets within each segment. The conditions of all three assets are determined using three independent ensemble machine learning models, each made up of Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Deep Learning as base learners. The required asset-level interventions are determined by these conditions combined with heuristics specific to each spatially collocated asset in a street segment to decide the segment-level synchronized or unsynchronized interventions and the nature of the street closures (partial, complete, or both) needed to undertake the interventions. The accuracies of the three models are 98.64%, 96.37%, and 82.38% for the pavement, water and sewer pipes, respectively. The segment-level intervention strategies resulted in both synchronized and unsynchronized interventions leading to complete, partial, or a combination of both partial and complete street closures. The predicted segment-level interventions had an accuracy of 79.92%. This research will aid municipal decision-makers in identifying and prioritizing synchronized segment-level interventions, therefore, improving the planning and estimation of the intervention durations and street closures. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Expert Systems with Applications,10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119671,1,1,No,,,,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-complexity machine learning models have been widely used for PM concentration prediction, but such models are often considered as “black boxes”, lacking interpretability. Here, a simple structure lightGBM model is built for ground PM estimation, and the SHAP approach is used to separate the meteorological contributions due to its strong influence on PM concentration. The models show good performance with correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.84–0.88, 0.80–0.85, and 0.71–0.79, for PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5-10 (2.5–10 μm), respectively. The lightGBM model trains 45 times faster than the XGBoost model while showing similar accuracy. More importantly, the models have small performance gaps between training and predicting (delta R2: 0.07–0.12), effectively reducing overfitting risk. The PM datasets (10 km daily) of three size ranges are then generated over China from 2000 to 2020. The SHAP method shows good agreement with the meteorological normalization approach in separating the meteorological contributions (R2 > 0.5). In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH), meteorology has greater influence on PM2.5-10 (−5.66%–9.99%) than PM2.5 and PM10. In the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD), albedo has a large contribution to PM2.5 concentration under the influence of solar radiation. Notably, relative humidity (RH) has different seasonal effects on PM of three size ranges. In the BTH region, RH has negative effects on PM2.5 (−0.52 μg/m3) and positive effects on PM10 (1.01 μg/m3) and PM2.5-10 (3.39 μg/m3) in spring, but has opposite effects in summer. The results of SHAP approach are consistent with existing conclusions and imply its feasibility in explaining haze formation. The generated PM datasets are useful in health assessment, environmental management, and climate change studies. © 2023",Chemosphere,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138742,1,1,Yes,"SHAP,LGBM",,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particulate matter (PM) is a significant air pollutant composed of liquid droplets such as acids, organic chemicals, metals, dirt, and dust. The concentration of PM in the air leads to numerous clinical symptoms of pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders. In many cases, respiratory diseases caused by the high concentration of PM has led to death in both human and animal. Hence, forecasting and sensing the PM concentration, specifically PM 2.5 and PM 10 in the air, turns out to be crucial. Such a prediction will help both the public and state administration of the region to take precautionary measures. Few studies have attempted to anticipate PM 2.5 in a single region, but their results have shown low efficiency. In this letter, a hybrid eigenvalue decomposition of the Hankel matrix (EVDHM) along with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) based model has been used to construct a highly efficient model. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the created EVDHM and ARIMA-based model, three cities in India have been chosen. Three cities (Kolkata, Siliguri, and Haldia) have been selected as per the tier-wise classification of cities by the Government of India based on population. From 2021 to 2023, the daily PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations have been recorded. After training and testing the EVDHM-ARIMA-based model, it is compared with some well-performed models from the literature. The created EVDHM-ARIMA model is highly efficient and robust for practical applications. © 2017 IEEE.",IEEE Sensors Letters,10.1109/lsens.2023.3270905,1,1,No,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current approaches rarely consider relative geographical locations when capturing spatial-temporal relations, instead the latent inter-dependencies (i.e., implicit spatial relations) of data as a replacement. However, such relations cannot necessarily reflect the diffusion of air pollutants in the real world, and genuine location-related information could be lost during the implicit relation learning process. In this article, we introduce a new concept, geospatial-temporal data, and propose a novel deep neural network architecture, CoupledGT, to learn the geospatial-temporal couplings within data for air quality prediction. Specifically, the asymmetric diffusion relation of air quality data between two areas is first explicitly represented by the newly developed planar Gaussian diffusion (PGD) equation. And then, a geospatial couplings diffuser (GCD) is designed to parameterize the PGD equation and learn multi-areas diffusion mutually affected geospatial couplings. Besides, the RNN is employed to capture temporal couplings of each area, and incorporated with GCD to learn both shared and unique characteristics of the geospatial-temporal data simultaneously, which empowers the generalization and efficiency of the model. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate our method is robust and outperforms existing baseline methods in air quality prediction tasks. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Different lags and the changing patterns of four European Reanalysis (ERA5) meteorological variables, rainfall, mean temperature, wind speed and relative humidity, and one soil parameter, the soil moisture, were used to select the suitable set of predictors using a non-greedy algorithm known as simulated annealing (SA). The selected predictors were used to simulate the temporal and spatial variability of air PM2.5 concentration over Iraq during the early summer (May-July), the most polluted months, using three advanced ML models, extremely randomized trees (ERT), stochastic gradient descent backpropagation (SGD-BP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) integrated with Bayesian optimizer. The spatial distribution of the annual average PM2.5 revealed the population of the whole of Iraq is exposed to a pollution level above the standard limit. The changes in temperature and soil moisture and the mean wind speed and humidity of the month before the early summer can predict the temporal and spatial variability of PM2.5 over Iraq during May-July.

The air pollutants considered in this study comprised particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO), whereas wind direction (WD), ambient temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (SR), and wind speed (WS) were analyzed for meteorological information. On average, air pollutants demonstrated lower concentrations than in 2019 for both locations except PM2.5 in Kuala Lumpur. The cumulative COVID-19 cases were negatively correlated with SR and WS but positively correlated with O3, NO2, RH, PM10, and PM2.5. Overall, RH (r = 0.494; p < 0.001) and PM2.5 (r = −0.396, p < 0.001) were identified as the most significant parameters that correlated positively and negatively with the total cases of COVID-19 in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, respectively.

Conventional air quality monitoring relies on expensive and cumbersome monitoring stations. Such stations are sparsely deployed over a region – typically one to a few per city. The extrapolation of the dynamic spatiotemporal data away from these stations might be inaccurate. In this paper, we present a participatory Vehicle Sensor Network (VSN) based on low-cost mobile nodes deployed on public (taxi) vehicles. The system enables continuous real-time data acquisition, transmission, and utilization. As compared to the conventional approaches, our system greatly improves sensing coverage. The proposed platform enables the acquisition of a large amount of georeferenced and time-stamped data. It provides real time pollution mapping and historical data view. The system’s operational stability and continuity are examined and confirmed through the analysis of background data collected during 15 days of experimental implementation. © 2023 by the authors.",Journal of Advances in Information Technology,10.12720/jait.14.1.39-45,1,1,No,,,,Kosovo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate forecasting of PM2.5 concentration is essential for air pollution control and prevention of health complications. A survey of the available scientific literature on random forest model for PM2.5 prediction is presented here. Methods: The scientific literature is extracted from Science Direct database based on a set of specified search criteria. The input features, data length, and evaluation parameters used in PM2.5 prediction were analyzed in this study. Results: The study shows that majority of the publications are aimed at the daily prediction of outdoor PM2.5. Most publications base their PM2.5 prediction on features aerosol optical depth (AOD) and boundary layer height (BLH). PM10 and NO2 are the main air pollutants employed in the PM2.5 estimation. Majority studies utilized input data lengths covering more than one year, and the effectiveness of prediction models are unaffected by the length of investigation. The coefficient of determination, R2, is the primary evaluation parameter used in all publications. The majority of research study indicated R2 values greater than 0.85, demonstrating the reasonable dependability and efficiency of random forest regression-based PM2.5 prediction models. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the publications use a variety of meteorological and geological features for PM2.5 estimation, depending on the context of the research as well as data accessibility. The findings demonstrate that it is hard to pinpoint the optimal model in any particular way. © 2023 The Author(s).

Estimation errors have limited the development of exposure science and environmental epidemiology. Thus, we developed a scenario-based exposure (SBE) model that covered 8 outdoor exposure scenarios and 1 indoor scenario with corresponding time-activity patterns in Baoding City. The linear regression analysis of the SBE yielded an R2 value of 0.913 with satisfactory accuracy and reliability. To apply the SBE model to large-scale studies, we predicted time-activity patterns with the random forest model and atmosphere-to-scenario ratios with the linear regression model to obtain the essential parameters of the SBE model; their R2 was 0.65–0.93. The developed model would economize the study expenditure of field sampling for personal PM2.5 and deepen the understanding of the influences of indoor and outdoor factors on personal PM2.5. Using this method, we found that the personal PM2.5 exposure of Chinese residents was 10.50–347.02 μg/m3 in 2020, higher than the atmospheric PM2.5 concentration.

In the context of global climate change, air quality prediction work has a substantial impact on humans’ daily lives. The current extensive usage of machine learning models for air quality forecasting has resulted in significant improvements to the sector. The long short-term memory network is a deep learning prediction model, which adds a forgetting layer to a recurrent neural network and has several applications in air quality prediction. The experimental data presented in this research include air pollution data (SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, and CO) and meteorological data (temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, and wind speed). Initially, using air pollution data to calculate the air pollution index (AQI) and the wavelet transform with the adaptive Stein risk estimation threshold is utilized to enhance the quality of meteorological data. Using detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA), the mutual association between pollution elements and meteorological elements is then quantified. On short, medium, and long scales, the prediction model’s accuracy increases by 1%, 1.6%, 2%, and 5% for window sizes (h) of 24, 48, 168, and 5000, and the efficiency increases by 5.72%, 8.64%, 8.29%, and 3.42%, respectively.

People can use the AQI to organize their activities in a way that reduces or prevents exposure to air pollution altogether. Based on the AQI, governments, organizations, and businesses can also make plans to reduce air pollution. The multi-model ensemble has recently become a popular method for forecasting time series; however, it encounters the research problems of multi-parameter optimization and interaction analysis. To this end, a reduced-form ensemble of short-term air quality forecasting with the Sparrow search algorithm and decomposition error correction model is proposed in this paper. First, the data are decomposed using the CEEMDAN decomposition algorithm. Second, the Sparrow search algorithm is used in the model training process to obtain the optimal hyperparameters of the deep learning model and construct the optimal deep learning model. Next, the constructed models are used to predict the decomposed data, and the Lagrange multiplier method is used to determine the weights of each deep learning model. At last, the prediction results of each deep learning model are combined according to the weights to obtain the combined prediction results. Experiments show that (1) GRU, Bi-GRU, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM are used to predict the undecomposed data and the data decomposed by CEEMADN. The outcomes demonstrate that the CEEMDAN decomposition technique can enhance the accuracy of the forecast, specifically an 11.248% reduction in average RMSE and a 0.865% increase in average R2. (2) A multi-model combination method based on the Lagrange multiplier method is designed, which can obtain the weights of each deep learning model, and the weights can combine multiple models. The results of the multi-model combination are better than those of the single model. (3) The Lagrange multiplier method was compared with the simple average combination model and the MAE inverse combination model. The experimental results show that the results obtained using the Lagrange multiplier method are better than the other two. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1007/s11356-023-25735-w,1,1,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternatively, high-resolution satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data can be employed for high-resolution mapping of PM2.5. For this purpose, different data-driven methods have been used in the literature. Recently, deep learning methods have demonstrated their ability to estimate PM2.5 from AOD data. However, these methods have several weaknesses in solving the problem of estimating PM2.5 from satellite AOD data. In this paper, the potential of the deep ensemble forest method for estimating the PM2.5 concentration from AOD data was evaluated. The results showed that the deep ensemble forest method with R2= 0.74 gives a higher accuracy of PM2.5 estimation than deep learning methods (R2= 0.67) as well as classic data-driven methods such as random forest (R2= 0.68). Additionally, the estimated values of PM2.5 using the deep ensemble forest algorithm were used along with ground data to generate a high-resolution map of PM2.5.

The wind of the typhoon periphery results in poor diffusion conditions and favorable conditions for transboundary air pollution. Random forest models are established to predict typhoon-Associated air quality in the area. The correlation coefficients and the root mean square errors in the air quality index (AQI) and PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and O3 concentrations are 0.84 (14.88), 0.86 (10.31μgm-3), 0.84 (17.03μgm-3), 0.51 (8.13μgm-3), 0.80 (13.64μgm-3) and 0.89 (22.43μgm-3), respectively. Additionally, the prediction models for non-Typhoon days are established. According to the feature importance output of the models, the differences in the meteorological drivers of typhoon days and non-Typhoon days are revealed. On typhoon days, the air quality is dominated by local source emission and accumulation as the sink of pollutants reduces significantly under stagnant weather, while it is dominated by the transportation and scavenging effect of sea breeze on non-Typhoon days. Therefore, our findings suggest that different air pollution control strategies for typhoon days and non-Typhoon days should be proposed. © 2023 The Author(s).",Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,10.5194/amt-16-1279-2023,1,1,No,,,,"China,Hong Kong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before fracking there is a lengthy period of preparation, which can represent a significant proportion of the well lifecycle. Extensive infrastructure is delivered onto site, leading to increased volumes of heavy traffic, energy generation and construction work on site. Termed the “pre-operational” period, this is rarely investigated as air quality evaluations typically focus on the extraction phase. In this work we quantify the change in air pollution during pre-operational activities at a shale gas exploration site near Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire, England. Baseline air quality measurements were made two years prior to any shale gas activity and were used as a training dataset for random forest (RF) machine learning models. The models allowed for a comparison between observed air quality during the pre-operational phase and a counterfactual business as usual (BAU) prediction. During the pre-operational phase a significant deviation from the BAU scenario was observed. This was characterised by significant enhancements in NOx and a concurrent reduction in O3, caused by extensive additional vehicle movements and the presence of combustion sources such as generators on the well pad. During the pre-operational period NOx increased by 274 % and O3 decreased by 29 % when compared to BAU model values. There was also an increase in primary emissions of NO2 during the pre-operational phase which may have implications for the attainment of ambient air quality standards in the local surroundings. Unconventional O&G development remains under discussion as a potential option for improving the security of supply of domestic energy, tensioned however against significant environmental impacts. Here we demonstrate that the preparative work needed to begin fracking elevates air pollution in its own right, a further potential disbenefit that should be considered. © 2022 The Author(s)",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159702,1,1,No,,,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in air pollution forecasting and monitoring research using artificial neural networks. Most prior work relied on modeling pollutant concentrations collected from ground-based monitors and meteorological data for long-term forecasting of outdoor ozone (O3), oxides of nitrogen, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Given that traditional, highly sophisticated air quality monitors are expensive and not universally available, these models cannot adequately serve those not living near pollutant monitoring sites. Furthermore, because prior models were built based on physical measurement data collected from sensors, they may not be suitable for predicting the public health effects of pollution exposure. Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate models to nowcast the observed pollution levels using web search data, which are publicly available in near real time from major search engines. Methods: We developed novel machine learning–based models using both traditional supervised classification methods and state-of-the-art deep learning methods to detect elevated air pollution levels at the US city level by using generally available meteorological data and aggregate web-based search volume data derived from Google Trends. We validated the performance of these methods by predicting 3 critical air pollutants (O3, nitrogen dioxide, and PM2.5) across 10 major US metropolitan statistical areas in 2017 and 2018. We also explore different variations of the long short-term memory model and propose a novel search term dictionary learner-long short-term memory model to learn sequential patterns across multiple search terms for prediction. Results: The top-performing model was a deep neural sequence model long short-term memory, using meteorological and web search data, and reached an accuracy of 0.82 (F1-score 0.51) for O3, 0.74 (F1-score 0.41) for nitrogen dioxide, and 0.85 (F1-score 0.27) for PM2.5, when used for detecting elevated pollution levels. Compared with using only meteorological data, the proposed method achieved superior accuracy by incorporating web search data. Conclusions: The results show that incorporating web search data with meteorological data improves the nowcasting performance for all 3 pollutants and suggest promising novel applications for tracking global physical phenomena using web search data. ©Chen Lin, Safoora Yousefi, Elvis Kahoro, Payam Karisani, Donghai Liang, Jeremy Sarnat, Eugene Agichtein.",JMIR Formative Research,10.2196/23422,1,1,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reports prepared by IQAir revels that India is 3rd most polluted country after Bangladesh and Pakistan, on the basis of fine particulates (PM2.5) concentration for the year 2020. In this article, the quality of air in six Indian cities is predicted using data-driven Artificial Neural Network. The data was taken from the 'Kaggle' online source. For six Indian cities, 6139 data sets for ten contaminants (PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, C6H6 and C7H8) were chosen. The datasets were collected throughout the last five years, from 2016 to 2020, and were used to develop the predictive model. Two machine learning model are proposing in this study namely Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) The R-value of ANN and GPR models are 0.9611 and 0.9843 sequentially. The other performance indices such as RMSE, MAPE, MAE of the GPR model are 21.4079, 7.8945% and 13.5884, respectively. The developed model is quite useful to update citizens about the predicted air quality of the urban spaces and protect them from getting affected by the poor ambient air quality.

At present, there is also a large amount of air pollution data. How to efficiently mine its hidden features to obtain the future concentration of pollutants is very important for the prevention and control of air pollution. Therefore we build a pollutant prediction model based on Lightweight Gradient Boosting Model (LightGBM) shallow machine learning and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Firstly, the PM2.5 pollutant concentration data of 34 air quality stations in Beijing and the data of 18 weather stations were matched in time and space to obtain an input data set. Subsequently, the input data set was cleaned and preprocessed, and the training set was obtained by methods such as input feature extraction, input factor normalization, and data outlier processing. The hourly PM2.5 concentration value prediction was achieved in accordance with experiments conducted with the hourly PM2.5 data of Beijing from January 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020. Ultimately, the optimal hourly series prediction results were obtained after model comparisons. Through the comparison of these two models, it is found that the RMSE predicted by LSTM model for each pollutant is nearly 50% lower than that of LightGBM, and is more consistent with the fitting curve between the actual observations. The exploration of the input step size of LSTM model found that the accuracy of 3-h input data was higher than that of 12-h input data. It can be used for the management and decision-making of environmental protection departments and the formulation of preventive measures for emergency pollution incidents. © 2022, The Author(s).",Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-022-24470-5,1,1,No,,,,"China,France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outdoor air pollution causes millions of premature deaths every year, mostly due to anthropogenic fine PM (Formula presented.). In addition, the prediction of ground-level PM (Formula presented.) is challenging, as it behaves randomly over time and does not follow the interannual variability. To maintain a healthy environment, it is essential to predict the PM (Formula presented.) value with great accuracy. We used different supervised machine learning algorithms based on regression and classification to accurately predict the daily PM (Formula presented.) values. In this study, several meteorological and atmospheric variables were retrieved from the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality’s monitoring stations corresponding to 2014–2019. These variables were analyzed by six different machine learning algorithms with various evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate that ML models effectively detect the effect of other variables on PM (Formula presented.) and can predict the data accurately, identifying potentially risky territory.

Air Quality (AQ) prediction has become critical recently to take action to reduce pollution. This research introduces a unique methodology for assessing the effectiveness of PM10 and PM2.5. Enhanced spatial, temporal sequence-Improved Sparse Auto Encoder with Deep Learning (EISAE-DL) has been proposed to predict AQ affected by the prolonged dependency of air pollution congregation. However, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) used in EISAE-DL has suffered from the learning of a long-term dependent sequence of the training dataset. In addition, it is hard to create very reliable AQ forecasts at higher periodic frequencies, such as daily, weekly, or even monthly. This paper proposes Transfer learning (TL) in a Stacked Bidirectional and Unidirectional LSTM to solve the learning issue in LSTM for long-term dependencies. So, EISAE-DL with TL and modified LSTM model is named as EISAEDeep Transfer Learning (EISAE-DTL). TL with a modified structure can handle large-size datasets effectively. However, training time is increased more than twice for non-transfer learning way of modeling due to TL, Wasserstein Distance-based adversarial learning is proposed in EISAE-DTL to decrease the variances among AQ data collected from any two sites.

The train test approach of machine learning and Akaike information criterion (AIC) have been used on the monthly data of five years to select the best auto-regressive model. Using the auto-correlation functions (ACF and PACF) and the seasonality component in the time-series dataset, a seasonal autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model with its minimum AIC has been chosen to forecast the AQI. This model is also validated by comparing its predicted values with the actual values of AQI. The results showed that the seasonal ARMA model of (1,0,0)(1,0,0)12 could forecast AQI based on a stationary dataset.

The concept of the green city has emerged as an urban solution by which to confront environmental challenges worldwide and is founded on air pollution levels that have increased meaningfully as a result of traffic in urban areas. Local governments are attempting to meet environmental challenges by developing public traffic policies such as air pollution protocols. However, several problems must still be solved, such as the need to link smart cars to these pollution protocols in order to find more optimal routes. We have, therefore, attempted to address this problem by conducting a study of local policies in the city of Madrid (Spain) with the aim of determining the importance of the vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the need to optimise a set of routes for a fleet. The results of this study have allowed us to propose a framework with which to dynamically implement traffic constraints. This framework consists of three main layers: the data layer, the prediction layer and the event generation layer. With regard to the data layer, a dataset has been generated from traffic data concerning the city of Madrid, and deep learning techniques have then been applied to this data. The results obtained show that there are interdependencies between several factors, such as weather conditions, air quality and the local event calendar, which have an impact on drivers’ behaviour. These interdependencies have allowed the development of an ontological model, together with an event generation system that can anticipate changes and dynamically restructure traffic restrictions in order to obtain a more efficient traffic system. This system has been validated using real data from the city of Madrid. © Copyright 2023 Ruiz de Gauna et al.",PeerJ Computer Science,10.7717/peerj-cs.1534,1,1,No,,,,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, research is needed to evaluate the consistency and efficiency of methods for studying these associations at local scales. Objective: To assess socioexposomic associations with COVID-19 outcomes across New Jersey and evaluate consistency of findings from multiple modeling approaches. Methods: We retrieved data for COVID-19 cases and deaths for the 565 municipalities of New Jersey up to the end of the first phase of the pandemic, and calculated mortality rates with and without long-term-care (LTC) facility deaths. We considered 84 spatially heterogeneous environmental, demographic and socioeconomic factors from publicly available databases, including air pollution, proximity to industrial sites/facilities, transportation-related noise, occupation and commuting, neighborhood and housing characteristics, age structure, racial/ethnic composition, poverty, etc. Six geostatistical models (Poisson/Negative-Binomial regression, Poison/Negative-Binomial mixed effect model, Poisson/Negative-Binomial Bersag-York-Mollie spatial model) and two Machine Learning (ML) methods (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting) were implemented to assess association patterns. The Shapley effects plot was established for explainable ML and change of support validation was introduced to compare performances of different approaches. Results: We found robust positive associations of COVID-19 mortality with historic exposures to NO2, population density, percentage of minority and below high school education, and other social and environmental factors. Exclusion of LTC deaths does not significantly affect correlations for most factors but findings can be substantially influenced by model structures and assumptions. The best performing geostatistical models involved flexible structures representing data variations. ML methods captured association patterns consistent with the best performing geostatistical models, and furthermore detected consistent nonlinear associations not captured by geostatistical models. Significance: The findings of this work improve the understanding of how social and environmental disparities impacted COVID-19 outcomes across New Jersey.

While many relevant issues have been widely studied, research into ambient air pollutant concentration prediction (APCP) during COVID-19 is still in its infancy. Most of the existing study on APCP is based on machine learning methods, which are not suitable for APCP during COVID-19 due to the different distribution of historical observations before and after the pandemic. Therefore, to fulfill the predictive task based on the historical observations with a different distribution, this paper proposes an improved transfer learning model combined with machine learning for APCP during COVID-19. Specifically, this paper employs the Gaussian mixture method and an optimization algorithm to obtain a new source domain similar to the target domain for further transfer learning. Then, several commonly used machine learning models are trained in the new source domain, and these well-trained models are transferred to the target domain to obtain APCP results. Based on the real-world dataset, the experimental results suggest that, by using the improved machine learning methods based on transfer learning, our method can achieve the prediction with significantly high accuracy. In terms of managerial insights, the effects of influential factors are analyzed according to the relationship between these influential factors and prediction results, while their importance is ranked through their average marginal contribution and partial dependence plots. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Knowledge-Based Systems,10.1016/j.knosys.2022.109996,1,1,Yes,"LR,BR,LASSO,GBDT,ER,SHAP",,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An integral part of the DT pipeline is the presence of feedback that can influence future input data. Estimated values of PM2.5 obtained from an ensemble of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are used to provide recommendations for decreasing the agglomeration levels.

We identify the most important air pollutants influencing the air quality of Kolkata during three different periods using Random Forest, a tree-based machine learning (ML) algorithm. It is found that the ambient air quality of Kolkata is mainly affected with the aid of particulate matter or PM (PM10 and PM2.5). However, the effect of the lockdown is most prominent on PM2.5 which spreads in the air of Kolkata due to diesel-driven vehicles, domestic and commercial combustion activities, road dust, and open burning. To predict urban PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations 24 h in advance, we use a deep learning (DL) model, namely, stacked-bidirectional long short-term memory (stacked-BDLSTM). The model is trained during the normal periods, and it shows the superiority over some supervised ML models, like support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor classifier, multilayer perceptron, long short-term memory, and statistical time series forecasting model autoregressive integrated moving average. This pre-trained stacked-BDLSTM is applied to predict the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 during the pandemic situation of two cases, viz., complete lockdown and partial lockdown using a deep model-based transfer learning (TL) approach (TLS-BDLSTM). Transfer learning aims to utilize the information gained from one problem to improve the predictive performance of a learning model for a different but related problem. Our work helps to demonstrate how TL is useful when there is a scarcity of data during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the drastic change in concentration of pollutants. The results reveal the best prediction performance of TLS-BDLSTM with a lead time of 24 h as compared to some well-known traditional ML and statistical models and the pre-trained stacked-BDLSTM. The prediction is then validated using the real-time data obtained during the complete lockdown due to COVID second wave (16 May–15 June 2021) with different time steps, e.g., 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96–120 h. TLS-BDLSTM involving transfer learning is seen to outperform the said comparing methods in modeling the long-term temporal dependency of multivariate time series data and boost the forecast efficiency not only in single step, but also in multiple steps. The proposed methodologies are effective, consistent, and can be used by operational organizations to utilize in monitoring and management of air quality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,10.1007/s10661-022-10761-x,1,1,Yes,LSTM,STACK,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, machine learning (ML) approaches were used to approximate the impact of air pollutants and metrological parameters on SO2 quality levels. The parameters, NO, NO2, O3, PM10, RH, HyC, T, and P are significant factors affecting air pollution in Jeddah city. These factors were considered as the input parameters of the ANNs, MARS, SVR, and Hybrid model to determine the effect of those factors on the SO2 quality level. Hence, ANN was employed to approximate the nonlinear relation between SO2 and input parameters. The MARS approach has successful applications in air pollution predictions as an ML tool, employed in this study. The SVR approach was used as a nonlinear modeling tool to predict the SO2 quality level. Furthermore, the MARS and SVR approaches were integrated to develop a novel hybrid modeling scheme for providing a nonlinear approximation of SO2 concentration. The main innovation of this hybrid approach applied for predicting the SO2 quality levels is to develop an efficient approach and reduce the time-consuming calibration processes. Four comparative statistical considerations, MAE, RMSE, NSE, and d, were applied to measure the accuracy and tendency.

Increased air pollution in the air is one of the main reasons for premature deaths around the globe. It was determined that while many methods provide adequate information about pollution levels, improvements could be made to avoid major errors. The traditional methods are either expensive or require a lot of data and human resources to correctly evaluate those data arrays. To avoid these problems, artificial neural networks (ANN) and other machine learning methods are widely used nowadays. Many ANN models for ship pollution evaluation in ports either included the whole port area or went even further and included cities near port areas. These studies show that ANNs can be effectively used to evaluate air pollution in a wide area. However, there is a lack of research on ANN usage for individual ship pollution or ship plume evaluation. This study attempts to fill this gap by developing an ANN model to evaluate an individual ship’s plumes by combining several data sources such as AIS data, meteorological data, and measured the ship’s plume pollutants concentration. Results show good correlation; however, additional limitations have to be overcome regarding data filtering and the overall accuracy of the model. © 2023 by the authors.",Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,10.3390/jmse11010150,1,1,No,,,,Lithuania,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to provide scientific support for the prevention and treatment of lung cancer by analyzing the epidemiological trends of lung cancer in China from 1990 to 2019. Based on the global health exchange database (GHDx), joinpoint and age-period-cohort analyses were performed to explore the trend of lung cancer incidence and mortality rates from 1990 to 2019. According to incidence rates from 1990 to 2019, a model was constructed to predict the incidence rates in the next 5 years. In addition, changes in risk factors associated with lung cancer deaths were compared between 1990 and 2019 and between males and females in 2019. The results are as follows. The age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs), and age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) of lung cancer among Chinese had overall upward trends from 1990 to 2019. The ASDRs of females and males in China decreased since 2010. Interestingly, from 2016 to 2019, the ASIRs and ASDRs of females rose significantly. The age-period-cohort model showed that the incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer in China increased with age, and the growth rate accelerated after 45 years old. After 2004, the relative risks of lung cancer incidence increased with the passage of the period. Also, after the 1950–1954 birth cohort, the risks of lung cancer incidence and death began to decrease. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model predicted that the incidence rates of lung cancer in China would continue to rise in the next 5 years. The top five risk factors for lung cancer deaths of both genders in 2019 were smoking, ambient particulate matter pollution, secondhand smoke, high fasting plasma glucose, and household air pollution from solid fuels. The above results provided precise clues for the prevention and treatment of lung cancer in China.

However, low-cost sensor data commonly exhibit non-linear biases with respect to environmental conditions that cannot be captured by linear models, therefore requiring extensive lab calibration. Further, these calibration models traditionally produce point estimates or uniform variance predictions which limits their downstream in exposure assessment. Objective: Build direct field-calibration models using probabilistic gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) that eliminate the need for resource-intensive lab calibration and that can be used to conduct probabilistic exposure assessments on the neighborhood level. Methods: Using data from Plantower A003 particulate matter (PM) sensors deployed in Baltimore, MD from November 2018 through November 2019, a fully probabilistic NGBoost GBDT was trained on raw data from sensors co-located with a federal reference monitoring station and compared against linear regression trained on lab calibrated sensor data. The NGBoost predictions were then used in a Monte Carlo interpolation process to generate high spatial resolution probabilistic exposure gradients across Baltimore. Results: We demonstrate that direct field-calibration of the raw PM2.5 sensor data using a probabilistic GBDT has improved point and distribution accuracies compared to the linear model, particularly at reference measurements exceeding 25 μg/m3, and also on monitors not included in the training set. Significance: We provide a framework for utilizing the GBDT to conduct probabilistic spatial assessments of human exposure with inverse distance weighting that predicts the probability of a given location exceeding an exposure threshold and provides percentiles of exposure. These probabilistic spatial exposure assessments can be scaled by time and space with minimal modifications. Here, we used the probabilistic exposure assessment methodology to create high quality spatial-temporal PM2.5 maps on the neighborhood-scale in Baltimore, MD. Impact statement: We demonstrate how the use of open-source probabilistic machine learning models for in-place sensor calibration outperforms traditional linear models and does not require an initial laboratory calibration step. Further, these probabilistic models can create uniquely probabilistic spatial exposure assessments following a Monte Carlo interpolation process.

While it is well-known that smoking is an avoidable high-risk factor for lung cancer, it is necessary to identify the extent to which other modified risk factors might further affect the cell’s genetic predisposition for lung cancer susceptibility, and the spreading of carcinogens in various geographical zones. This study aims to examine the association between lung cancer mortality (LCM) and major risk factors. We used Fuzzy Inference Modeling (FIM) and Random Forest Modeling (RFM) approaches to analyze LCM and its possible links to 30 risk factors in 100 countries over the period from 2006 to 2016. Analysis results suggest that in addition to smoking, low physical activity, child wasting, low birth weight due to short gestation, iron deficiency, diet low in nuts and seeds, vitamin A deficiency, low bone mineral density, air pollution, and a diet high in sodium are potential risk factors associated with LCM. This study demonstrates the usefulness of two approaches for multi-factor analysis of determining risk factors associated with cancer mortality. © 2022 by the authors.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,10.3390/ijerph192114161,2,1,No,,,,"United States,China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, it is difficult to determine whether the front vehicle brake lights are turned on due to various lights installed in a highway tunnel, reflections on the surface of vehicles, movement of high-speed vehicles, and air pollution. Since driving vehicles turn on headlights in highway tunnels, it is difficult to detect whether the vehicle brake lights are on or not through color and brightness change analysis in the brake light area only with a single image. Therefore, there is a need for a method of detecting whether the vehicle brake lights are turned on by using a sustainable change obtained from image sequences and estimated distance information. In the proposed method, a deep convolutional neural network(DCNN) is used to detect vehicles, and inverse perspective mapping is used to estimate the distance. Then, a long short-term memory (LSTM) Network that can analyze temporal continuity information is used to detect whether the brake lights of the detected vehicles are turned on. The proposed method detects whether or not the vehicle brake lights are turned on by learning the long-term dependence of the detected vehicles and the estimated distances in an image sequence. Experiments on the proposed method in highway tunnels show that the detection accuracy of whether the front vehicle brake lights are turned on or not is 90.6%, and collision accidents between vehicles can be prevented in highway tunnels. © 2022 by the author.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su142114322,2,1,No,,,,South Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is of great importance to detect APEs timely and effectively using contaminant measurements from the air quality monitoring network (AQMN) in the CIP. Traditionally, APE can be detected by determining whether the contaminant concentration at any ambient monitoring station exceeds the national environmental standard. However, the environmental standards used are unified in various ambient monitoring stations, which ignores the source–receptor relationship in the CIP and challenges the effective detection of excessive emissions in some scenarios. In this paper, an approach based on a multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) method is proposed to detect the APEs caused by excessive emissions from CIPs. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the spatial relationships hidden among the historical environmental monitoring data are extracted, and the high-dimensional data are projected into only two subspaces. Then, two monitoring indices, T2 and Q, which represent the variability in these subspaces, are utilized to monitor the pollution status and detect the potential APEs in the CIP. In addition, the concept of APE detectability is also defined, and the condition for APE detectability is derived, which explains when the APEs can be detectable. A simulated case for a CIP in Zhejiang province of China is studied to evaluate the performance of this approach. The study indicates that the method can have an almost 100% APE detection rate. The real-world measurements of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) at a 10-min time interval from 3 December 2020 ∼ 12 December 2020 are also analyzed, and 64 APEs caused by excessive TVOC emissions are detected in a total of 1440 time points. © 2022 by the authors.

An increasing trend in particulate matter, PM 2.5, is a threat because it can lead to uncontrollable consequences like worsening of asthma and cardiovascular disease. The metric used to measure air quality is the air pollutant index (API). In Malaysia, machine learning (ML) techniques for PM 2.5 have received less attention as the concentration is on predicting other air pollutants. To fill the research gap, this study focuses on correctly predicting PM 2.5 concentrations in the smart cities of Malaysia by comparing supervised ML techniques, which helps to mitigate its adverse effects. Methods In this paper, ML models for forecasting PM 2.5 concentrations were investigated on Malaysian air quality data sets from 2017 to 2018. The dataset was preprocessed by data cleaning and a normalization process. Next, it was reduced into an informative dataset with location and time factors in the feature extraction process. The dataset was fed into three supervised ML classifiers, which include random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). Finally, their output was evaluated using the confusion matrix and compared to identify the best model for the accurate prediction of PM 2.5. Results Overall, the experimental result shows an accuracy of 97.7% was obtained by the RF model in comparison with the accuracy of ANN (61.14%) and LSTM (61.77%) in predicting PM 2.5. Discussion RF performed well when compared with ANN and LSTM for the given data with minimum features. RF was able to reach good accuracy as the model learns from the random samples by using decision tree with the maximum vote on the predictions. © 2022 Palanichamy N et al.",F1000Research,10.12688/f1000research.73166.1,2,1,Yes,"RF,ANN,LSTM",,,"Malaysia,India",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, decision-makers need low-cost, efficient tools with high spatiotemporal representation for monitoring air pollutants around urban areas and sensitive regions. Air pollution forecasting models with different time steps and forecast lengths are used as an alternative and support to traditional air quality monitoring stations (AQMS). In recent decades, given their eligibility to reconcile the relationship between parameters of complex systems, artificial neural networks have acquired the utmost importance in the field of air pollution forecasting. In this study, different machine learning regression methods are used to establish a mathematical relationship between air pollutants and meteorological factors from four AQMS (A-D) located between Çerkezköy and Süleymanpaşa, Tekirdağ. The model input variables included air pollutants and meteorological parameters. All developed models were used with the intent to provide instantaneous prediction of the air pollutant parameter NOx within the AQMS and across different stations. In the GMDH (group method of data handling)-type neural network method (namely the self-organizing deep learning approach), a five hidden layer structure consisting of a maximum of five neurons was preferred and, choice of layers and neurons were made in a way to minimize the error. In all models developed, the data were divided into a training (80%) and a testing set (20%). Based on R2, RMSE, and MAE values of all developed models, GMDH provided superior results regarding the NOx prediction within AQMS (reaching 0.94, 10.95, and 6.65, respectively for station A) and between different AQMS. The GMDH model yielded NOx prediction of station B by using station A input variables (without using NOx data as model input) with R2, RMSE and MAE values 0.80, 10.88, 7.31 respectively. The GMDH model is found suitable for being employed to fill in the gaps of air pollution records within and across-AQMS.

To address this gap, we develop and evaluate four Machine Learning (ML) models on two disparate datasets using Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) parameters as primary features and components of self-reported IAQ satisfaction and sleep quality as target variables. In each case, we compare models to each other as well as to a simple model that always predicts the majority outcome. In the first analysis, we use open-source data collected from 93 California residences to predict occupant’s satisfaction with their indoor environment. Results indicate building ventilation rate, Relative Humidity (RH), and formaldehyde are most influential when predicting IAQ perception and do so with an accuracy greater than the simplified model. The second analysis uses IAQ data gathered from a field study we conducted with 20 participants over 11 weeks to train similar models. We obtain accuracy and F1 scores similar to the simplified model where PM2.5 and TVOCs represent the most important predictors. Our results underscore the ability of IAQ to affect a person’s perception of their built environment and health and highlight the utility of ML models to explore the strength of these relationships. Implications: The results from this study show that two outcome variables–occupant’s indoor air quality (IAQ) satisfaction and perceived sleep quality–are related to the measured IAQ parameters but not heavily influenced by typical values measured in apartments and homes. This study highlights the ability of machine learning models as exploratory analysis tools to determine underlying relationships within and across datasets in addition to understanding the importance of certain features on the outcome variable. We compare four different models and find that the random forest classifier has the best performance in both analysis on IAQ satisfaction and perceived sleep quality. It is a suitable model for predicting IAQ-related subjective metrics and also provides value insight into the feature importance of the IAQ parameters. The accuracy of any of these machine learning models in predicting occupants’ comfort or sleep quality is limited by the dataset size, how data is collected, and range of data. This study identifies the factors that are important to IAQ perception: ventilation rate, relative humidity, and concentrations of formaldehyde, NO2, and particulate matter. It indicates that sensors that can measure these variables are necessary for future, related studies that model occupants’ IAQ satisfaction. However, this study does not find strong relationships between any of the IAQ parameters measured in this study and perceived sleep quality despite the logical pathway between these many pollutants and respiratory issues. A prediction model of IAQ perception or sleep quality can be integrated into home management systems to automatically adjust building operations such as ventilation rates in smart buildings. Once buildings are equipped with a network of low-cost sensors that measure concentrations of pollutants and operating conditions of the ventilation system, the prediction model can be used to predict the occupants’ comfort and facilitate the control of the ventilation system. © 2022 Air & Waste Management Association.",Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association,10.1080/10962247.2022.2105439,1,1,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Predicting air pollutant concentration can provide useful information for urban environmental governance decision-making and residents' daily health control. However, existing methods fail to model the temporal dependencies or have suffer from a weak ability to capture the spatial correlations of air pollutants. In this paper, we propose a general approach to predict air pollutant concentration, named DSTFN, which consists of a data completion component, a similar region selection component, and a deep spatial-Temporal fusion network. The data completion component uses tensor decomposition method to complete the missing data of historical air quality. The similar region selection component uses region metadata to calculate the spatial similarity between regions. The deep spatial-Temporal fusion network fuses urban heterogeneous data to capture factors affecting air quality and predict air pollutant concentration.

However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of air pollution, the contribution of various factors to them, and the resultant health impacts have yet to be evaluated comprehensively. This study integrates machine learning (random forest) into LUR modeling (LURF) with intensive evaluations to develop high spatiotemporal resolution prediction models to estimate daily and diurnal PM2.5 and NO2 in Seoul, South Korea, at the spatial resolution of 500 m for a year (2019) and to then evaluate the contribution of driving factors and quantify the resultant premature mortality. Our results show that incorporating the random forest algorithm into our LUR model improves the model performance. Meteorological conditions have a great influence on daily models, while land-use factors play important roles in diurnal models. Our health assessment using dynamic population data estimates that PM2.5 and NO2 pollution, when combined, causes a total of 11,183 (95% CI: 5837-16,354) premature mortalities in Seoul in 2019, of which 64.9% are due to PM2.5, while the remaining are attributable to NO2. The air pollution-attributable health impacts in Seoul are largely caused by cardiovascular diseases including stroke. This study pinpoints the significant spatiotemporal variations and health impact of PM2.5 and NO2 in Seoul, providing essential data for epidemiological research and air quality management.",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,10.1021/acs.est.2c03027,1,1,No,,,,"Peoples R China,South Korea,Singapore",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This poses a serious need of the hour for the Indian scientists, engineers, and authorities as a whole to fight and reduce it as much as possible. The time has come when one needs to plan their outside activities on pollution levels and air quality status. Air Quality Index (AQI) varies daily; hence it is difficult to predict future trends for the same. The current study proposed a machine learning-based model that uses sensors, past/present pollutants concentration data, and satellite data to predict air pollution in the regions in India. We emphasize the fact that other than measurable pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, etc.); meteorological data like wind, temperature, and fire are also important factors in determining pollution. The model uses Long Short-Term Memory, which is the state-of-the-art technique used for time series prediction. The model could predict the concentration of the pollutants and calculate the AQI for the areas where data was available for the near future. The Root Mean Square Error on test data is 54. The results are quite promising and future model can be made, taking this as a base model.

The negative impact of air pollution on housing prices decreases when the degree of air pollution intensifies.

The traditional process of turning observations into physical understanding is slow. Imperfect models are constructed and tested to explain relationships in data. Powerful new algorithms can enable computers to learn physics by observing images and videos. Inspired by this idea, instead of training machine learning models using physical quantities, we used images, that is, pixel information. For this work, and as a proof of concept, the physics of interest are wind-driven spatial patterns. These phenomena include features in Aeolian dunes and volcanic ash deposition, wildfire smoke, and air pollution plumes. We use computer model simulations of spatial deposition patterns to approximate images from a hypothetical imaging device whose outputs are red, green, and blue (RGB) color images with channel values ranging from 0 to 255. In this paper, we explore deep convolutional neural network-based autoencoders to exploit relationships in wind-driven spatial patterns, which commonly occur in geosciences, and reduce their dimensionality. Reducing the data dimension size with an encoder enables training deep, fully connected neural network models linking geographic and meteorological scalar input quantities to the encoded space. Once this is achieved, full spatial patterns are reconstructed using the decoder. We demonstrate this approach on images of spatial deposition from a pollution source, where the encoder compresses the dimensionality to 0.02% of the original size, and the full predictive model performance on test data achieves a normalized root mean squared error of 8%, a figure of merit in space of 94% and a precision-recall area under the curve of 0.93.",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/s41598-023-28590-4,1,1,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this in mind, Macau needs an air quality forecast system that accurately predicts pollutant concentration during the occurrence of pollution episodes to warn the public ahead of time. Five different state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to create predictive models to forecast PM2.5, PM10, and CO concentrations for the next 24 and 48 h, which included artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), and multiple linear regression (MLR), to determine the best ML algorithms for the respective pollutants and time scale. The diurnal measurements of air quality data in Macau from 2016 to 2021 were obtained for this work. The 2020 and 2021 datasets were used for model testing, while the four-year data before 2020 and 2021 were used to build and train the ML models. Results show that the ANN, RF, XGBoost, SVM, and MLR models were able to provide good performance in building up a 24-h forecast with a higher coefficient of determination (R-2) and lower root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and biases (BIAS). Meanwhile, all the ML models in the 48-h forecasting performance were satisfactory enough to be accepted as a two-day continuous forecast even if the R-2 value was lower than the 24-h forecast. The 48-h forecasting model could be further improved by proper feature selection based on the 24-h dataset, using the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) value test and the adjusted R-2 value of the 48-h forecasting model. In conclusion, the above five ML algorithms were able to successfully forecast the 24 and 48 h of pollutant concentration in Macau, with the RF and SVM models performing the best in the prediction of PM2.5 and PM10, and CO in both 24 and 48-h forecasts.",SUSTAINABILITY,10.3390/su15065341,1,1,Yes,"ANN,RF,XGB,SVM,LR",,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maritime ports are essential interfaces that support cargo handling between sea and hinterland transportation. Besides, in this area, environmental protection is becoming extremely important. Global warming, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions are all having a detrimental influence on the environment and will most likely continue to do so for future generations. Hence, there is a growing need to promote environmental sustainability in maritime-based transportation. The application of machine learning (ML), as one of the main subdomains of artificial intelligence (AI), can be considered a component within the process of digital transformation to advance green activities in maritime port logistics. Thus, this article presents the results of a systematic literature review of the recent literature on machine learning for promoting environmentally sustainable maritime ports.

Although metrics and indexes of vulnerability have been associated with COM, advanced methods are required to account for the intricate intertwining of associations. This cross-sectional study utilized a novel approach that combined machine learning and epidemiol-ogy to identify high-risk sociodemographic and environmental factors linked to COM in United States counties. The study consisted of 987,009 decedents from 2,717 counties, and the Classification and Regression Trees model identified 9 county socio-environmental clusters that were closely associated with COM, with a 64.1% relative increase across the spectrum. The most important variables that emerged from this study were teen birth, pre-1960 housing (lead paint indicator), area deprivation index, median household income, number of hospitals, and exposure to particulate matter air pollution. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the socio-environmental drivers of COM and highlights the importance of utilizing machine learning approaches to identify high-risk populations and inform targeted interventions for reducing disparities in COM. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Pedestrian height areas in adjacent external spaces (AES) of street canyons are most severely affected by traffic pollutants. In order to find block morphological optimization strategies that can mitigate the concentration of pollutants in the area, machine learning (ML) regression models were investigated to replace the time-intensive computer fluid dynamic (CFD) model. Data from 1000 CFD simulation cases were used to train and test the ML models. The best surrogate model was selected and coupled with optimization algorithms. Both single-objective and multi-objective optimization problems based on regional concentration parameters were discussed. The results showed that the block's standard deviation of building height (BHstd) was an essential morphological parameter that can effectively impact the pollutant concentration. The effect mechanism of the building height at different locations in the block on the concentration of the pollutant in the different regions also varies. The optimum block configuration obtained from the optimizations coupled ML model can facilitate reducing pollutant concentrations. This study provides a framework for residential block design optimization that can help urban designers efficiently evaluate and select block layouts conducive to reducing the impact of traffic pollutants.",BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110587,1,1,No,,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the interaction between atmospheric pollution-related health burdens and urbanization, this study employed deep learning technology to obtain high-resolution satellite-derived PM2.5 concentration data across the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Using the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM), this study estimated premature mortality resulting from long-term exposure to PM2.5 and innovatively incorporated exposure factors to improve accuracy. Results indicated that while PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 16.13% from 2015 to 2019, the region still experienced 239,000 premature mortalities in 2019, with notable disparities among cities of different economic levels and sizes. Furthermore, it was found through correlation analysis that residential density and GDP per capita were highly associated with premature mortality.

In this work we propose a machine-learning approach to forecast high-frequency spatial fields which has two distinctive advantages from standard neural network methods in time: (1) sparsity of the neural network via a spike-and-slab prior and (2) a small parametric space. The introduction of stochastic neural networks generates additional uncertainty, and in this work we propose a fast approach for ensure that the forecast is correctly assessed (calibration), both marginally and spatially.

Accurate forest flame segmentation is vital for effective fire management and protection of ecosystems. It improves detection, response, and understanding of fire behavior. Due to the easy accessibility and rich information content of forest remote sensing images, remote sensing techniques are frequently applied in forest flame segmentation. With the advancement of deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques have been widely adopted for forest flame segmentation and have achieved remarkable results. However, forest remote sensing images often have high resolutions, and relative to the entire image, forest flame regions are relatively small, resulting in class imbalance issues. Additionally, mainstream semantic segmentation methods are limited by the receptive field of CNNs, making it challenging to effectively extract global features from the images and leading to poor segmentation performance when relying solely on labeled datasets. To address these issues, we propose a method based on the deeplabV3+ model, incorporating the following design strategies: (1) an adaptive Copy-Paste data augmentation method is introduced to learn from challenging samples (Images that cannot be adequately learned due to class imbalance and other factors) effectively, (2) transformer modules are concatenated and parallelly integrated into the encoder, while a CBAM attention mechanism is added to the decoder to fully extract image features, and (3) a dice loss is introduced to mitigate the class imbalance problem. By conducting validation on our self-constructed dataset, our approach has demonstrated superior performance across multiple metrics compared to current state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods. Specifically, in terms of IoU (Intersection over Union), Precision, and Recall metrics for the flame category, our method has exhibited notable enhancements of 4.09%, 3.48%, and 1.49%, respectively, when compared to the best-performing UNet model. Moreover, our approach has achieved advancements of 11.03%, 9.10%, and 4.77% in the same aforementioned metrics as compared to the baseline model.",FORESTS,10.3390/f14091887,1,1,No,,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present a comparative analysis of urban ozone (O-3) responses to nitrogen oxide (NOx) changes in China and the United States (US) over 2015-2020 by integrating various data- and model-based methods. The data-based deep learning (DL) model exhibited good performance in simulating urban air quality: the correlation coefficients (R) of O-3 daily variabilities with respect to independent O-3 observations are 0.88 and 0.79 over N. China, 0.87 and 0.90 over S. China, and 0.87 and 0.49 over E. United States by the DL and GEOS-Chem chemical transport models, respectively. Furthermore, the data-based methods suggest volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regimes in urban areas over northern inland China and transitional regimes over eastern US urban areas; in contrast, GEOS-Chem model suggests strong NOx-limited regimes. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the inconsistent O-3 responses are partially caused by the inaccurate representation of O-3 precursor concentrations at the locations of urban air quality stations in the simulations, while the data-based methods are driven by the variabilities in local O-3 precursor concentrations and meteorological conditions. The O-3 responses to NOx changes reported here provide a better understanding of urban O-3 pollution; for example, reductions in NOx emissions are suggested to have resulted in an increase in surface O-3 by approximately 7 ppb in the Sichuan Basin in 2014-2020.",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,10.1029/2022jd038228,1,1,Yes,"CNN,LSTM",,,"Peoples R China,Canada,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present the spatiotemporal evolution of ozone concentrations from 2010 to 2021 using measurements of the national air quality monitoring network. We evaluate the effectiveness of the national air pollution control programme, including Phase 1 (2013-2017) and Phase 2 (2018-2021), in reducing the ozone level over China, using an optimized machine learning approach, high-resolution emission estimates and an improved air quality model. We find that while emission changes in Phase 1 increased the ozone level over the five highly developed regions, further reductions of nitrogen oxide emissions in Phase 2 have generally constrained the ozone pollution. The changing effect of emission controls on ozone pollution is due to the shift in the prevailing regime for ozone formation and the weakened effects of aerosol declines, as emission reductions continue. We further find that current emission controls have been more effective in rural locales in four of the five regions, and more effective in summer than winter. Therefore, further control of ozone pollution should consider these regional and seasonal variations to identify the most important precursors for the pollution. Sustained emission reductions have altered the prevailing regime for ozone formation over China, weakening the trade-off in pollution control between aerosols and ozone, according to analyses of ozone pollution chemistry between 2013 and 2021.",NATURE GEOSCIENCE,10.1038/s41561-023-01284-2,1,1,No,,,,"Peoples R China,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to investigate the relationship between exposure to the chemical constituents of PM2.5 air pollution and decreased sperm quality and to further explore the exposure-response relationship. We conducted a multicenter population-based cohort study including 78,952 semen samples from 33,234 donors at 6 provincial human sperm banks (covering central, northern, southern, eastern, and southwestern parts of China) between 2014 and 2020. Daily exposure to PM2.5 chemical composition was estimated using a deep learning model integrating a density ground-based measure network at a 1 km resolution. Linear mixed models with subject- and center-specific intercepts were used to quantify the harmful impacts of PM2.5 constituents on semen quality and explore their exposure-response relationships. Per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 exposure levels during spermatogenesis was significantly associated with decreased sperm concentration, progressive motility, and total motility.

A change in the microclimate, fluid mechanics, geomorphic, ecological, or biogeochemical conditions will impact the water's quantity and quality. There is a reduction in the groundwater because of the difficulty that water has soaked into the earth as more roads are built.

Next, it identifies the air quality in Urban Development (Conv. LSTM).

Objectives: We estimated associations of long-term exposure to PM2.5 chemical constituents with allergic disease risks and effect modification. Methods: We used the baseline of a newly established, provincially representative cohort of 51,480 participants in southwest China. The presence of allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, urticaria, and allergic conjunctivitis was selfreported by following a formed questionnaire in face-to-face interviews. The average concentrations of PM2.5 chemical constituents (NO3-, SO42-, NH4+, organic matter [OM], and black carbon [BC]) over participants' residence were estimated using machine learning models. Logistic regression with double robust estimator and weighted quantile sum regression were used to estimate the effects of PM2.5 chemical constituents on allergic disease risks, as well as relative importance of each PM2.5 chemical constituent. Results: Per interquartile range increase in the concentration of all PM2.5 chemical constituents was associated with the elevated risks for allergic asthma (OR = 1.79 [1.41-2.26]), allergic conjunctivitis (1.54 [1.19-2.00]), urticaria (1.36 [1.25-1.48]), and allergic rhinitis (1.18 [1.11-1.26]). NO3- contributed more to risks for allergic asthma (weight = 46.05 %), urticaria (72.29 %), and allergic conjunctivitis (47.65 %), while NH4+ contributed more to allergic rhinitis (78.07 %). OM contributed most to the risks for allergic asthma (30.81 %) and allergic conjunctivitis (31.40 %). BC was also associated with allergic rhinitis, urticaria, and allergic conjunctivitis, only with a considerable weight for urticaria (24.59 %). Joint effects of PM2.5 chemical constituents on risks for allergic rhinitis and urticaria were stronger in minorities and farmers than their counterparts.

The Amazon rain forest is one of the Brazilian biomes that suffers the most with fires caused by droughts and illegal deforestation. These fires can bring respiratory diseases associated with air pollution, and the State of Para in Brazil is the most affected. COVID-19 pandemics associated with air pollution can potentially increase hospitalizations and deaths related to respiratory diseases. Here, we aimed to evaluate the association of fire occurrences with the COVID-19 mortality rates and general respiratory diseases hospitalizations in the State of Para, Brazil. Methods We employed machine learning technique for clustering k-means accompanied with the elbow method used to identify the ideal quantity of clusters for the k-means algorithm, clustering 10 groups of cities in the State of Para where we selected the clusters with the highest and lowest fires occurrence from the 2015 to 2019. Next, an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous (ARIMAX) model was proposed to study the serial correlation of respiratory diseases hospitalizations and their associations with fire occurrences. Regarding the COVID-19 analysis, we computed the mortality risk and its confidence level considering the quarterly incidence rate ratio in clusters with high and low exposure to fires. Findings Using the k-means algorithm we identified two clusters with similar DHI (Development Human Index) and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) from a group of ten clusters that divided the State of Para but with diverse behavior considering the hospitalizations and forest fires in the Amazon biome. From the auto-regressive and moving average model (ARIMAX), it was possible to show that besides the serial correlation, the fires occurrences contribute to the respiratory diseases increase, with an observed lag of six months after the fires for the case with high exposure to fires. A highlight that deserves attention concerns the relationship between fire occurrences and deaths. Historically, the risk of mortality by respiratory diseases is higher (about the double) in regions and periods with high exposure to fires than the ones with low exposure to fires. The same pattern remains in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the risk of mortality for COVID-19 was 80% higher in the region and period with high exposure to fires. Regarding the SARS-COV-2 analysis, the risk of mortality related to COVID-19 is higher in the period with high exposure to fires than in the period with low exposure to fires. Another highlight concerns the relationship between fire occurrences and COVID-19 deaths. The results show that regions with high fire occurrences are associated with more cases of COVID deaths. Interpretation The decision-make process is a critical problem mainly when it involves environmental and health control policies. Environmental policies are often more cost-effective as health measures than the use of public health services. This highlight the importance of data analyses to support the decision making and to identify population in need of better infrastructure due to historical environmental factors and the knowledge of associated health risk. The results suggest that The fires occurrences contribute to the increase of the respiratory diseases hospitalization. The mortality rate related to COVID-19 was higher for the period with high exposure to fires than the period with low exposure to fires. The regions with high fire occurrences is associated with more COVID-19 deaths, mainly in the months with high number of fires. Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Various estimation methods are employed to determine the PM10 concentration using historical data on controlling PM10 air pollution, early warning, and protecting public health and the environment. The present study analyses different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models that can predict hourly PM10 concentration. In parallel, the study also investigates the effectiveness of the data preprocessing and feature selection (DPFS) process on the prediction accuracy of the LSTM models. For this purpose, three different LSTM models, namely Vanilla, Bi-Directional, and Stacked, were developed. Then, a comprehensive data preprocessing stage is used to eliminate missing and erroneous data and outliers from real-world raw data, and a feature selection process is applied to extract unnecessary features. The LSTM models consider three air quality parameters, including SO2, O3, and CO, and three meteorological factors, including relative humidity, wind direction, and wind speed. The prediction performances of the LSTM models are compared using the RMSE, MAE and R2 performance index according to whether DPFS is used in the models or not. As a result, when the DPFS process was applied, the proposed LSTM models achieved high prediction performance and can be used to predict hourly PM10 concentrations. Overall, the DPFS process significantly enhanced the developed LSTM modelsÂ prediction performance. Furthermore, the proposed model might be a useful tool for city administrators to make decisions and improve air quality management efforts.

Heavy metals have attracted extensive attention because of their non-degradability, significant biotoxicity, and persistence. In this work, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) combined with random forest (RF) was utilized to directly evaluate the potential ecological risk of metals. The LIBS spectra of 17 atmospherically deposited particulate matter samples were collected, and three metal elements (V, Cr, and Zn) were identified from the National Institute of Standards and Technology database. The influence of predictive ability with different spectral preprocessing methods on the RF calibration model was then investigated, and the input variable was selected by variable importance measurement to further enhance the accuracy of predictive ability. Under the optimized spectral preprocessing method, VI threshold, and model parameters, the mean relative error of prediction set (MREP) for potential ecological risk index analysis (V, Cr, and Zn) was calculated as 0.0206, 0.0529, and 0.2218, respectively, and the determination coefficient of prediction set (RP2) was 0.9220, 0.9458, and 0.9359, respectively. These values inferred the overall lack of significant contamination at the time of the study. In summary, a novel approach based on LIBS combined with RF provides a new idea and method to directly evaluate the potential ecological risk of air pollution.

Consequently, this research examines the influence of various urban block typologies on urban pollutant distribution. Four typologies are simulated by ENVI-MET software. These typologies are cubic-shaped, L-shaped, C-shaped, and linear-shaped models. Urban air quality was assessed using relative humidity, temperature, and pollution PM2.5 concentration. The performance of typologies in terms of temperature, relative humidity, and reduction of air permeability is strongly dependent on the blocks' orientation, the block shape's rotation concerning the horizontal and vertical extensions, the height of the blocks, and the type of typology. According to these parameters, the performance is different in each of these studied typologies. Regression models propose a more reliable prediction of PM2.5 when the independent variables are temperature, relative humidity, and height of buildings, among various block typologies. Hence, this article suggests a machine learning approach, and the model evaluation shows that the Polynomial Linear Regression (PLR) model is excellent for measuring air pollution and temperature.

In this context, the association between meteorological factors and poor air quality possibly contributes to the transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, analyzing historical data of particulate matter (PM (Formula presented.) and PM (Formula presented.)) and meteorological factors in indoor and outdoor environments to discover patterns that allow predicting future confirmed cases of COVID-19 is a challenge within a long pandemic. In this study, a hybrid approach based on machine learning and deep learning is proposed to predict confirmed cases of COVID-19. On the one hand, a clustering algorithm based on K-means allows the discovery of behavior patterns by forming groups with high cohesion. On the other hand, multivariate linear regression is implemented through a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, building a reliable predictive model in the training stage. The LSTM prediction model is evaluated through error metrics, achieving the highest performance and accuracy in predicting confirmed cases of COVID-19, using data of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations and meteorological factors of the outdoor environment. The predictive model obtains a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0897, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0837, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.4229 in the testing stage. When using a dataset of PM2.5, PM10, and meteorological parameters collected inside 20 households from 27 May to 13 October 2021, the highest performance is obtained with an RMSE of 0.0892, MAE of 0.0592, and MAPE of 0.2061 in the testing stage.

Decision tree recursive analysis combined with a spatial autoregressive model is used to identify governance factors in China. Empirical results show several interesting findings. First, geographic location, administrative level, economic zones and regional planning are the main heterogeneous features of accurate air pollution governance in Chinese cities. Second, significant influencing factors of air pollution in different delineated regions are identified, especially significant differences between coastal and non-coastal cities. Third, the trends of heterogeneity in urban air governance in China are to some extent consistent with national policies.

Because air quality greatly affects the everyday existence of human, it is essential to examine the changes in air quality and predict them precisely. Our investigation focused on gauging and foreseeing the air quality of 145 crossways/intersections for smart urban communities, like Ahmedabad, Gujarat in India independently because air quality varies from intersection to intersection as it depends on several parameters, like traffic, industrial area, time of the day, etc. The significant issue with this investigation is the accessibility of the dataset for every crossway of the city. To address the issue we have created the estimation information for the air quality index (AQI) for Ahmedabad city from a similar approach as the dataset produced for Aarhus city, Denmark. The aftereffect of this examination is promising to foresee the air quality index for the intersections, utilizing artificial neural network (ANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). At last, we examine and compare the correctness of different configurations using root mean square error in the prediction of the actual vs predicted AQI using the proposed configuration. In this paper air quality index for Ahmedabad city is generated from the same methodology as the data of Aarhus city, Denmark generated for the period of 1/8/2018 to 1/10/2018. The previous studies were based on predicting an AQI for the whole city. The novel part of this study is to develop a dataset for the Ahmedabad city, Gujarat, India and junctionwise prediction of the AQI. Moreover, the paper has proposed the client-server model to get the prediction of AQI for different 145 crossways in the city. Paper derives the conclusion that for the given dataset, the LSTM predicts AQI more accurately than the ANN.

Since the 1990s, Saudi ArabiaÂs cities have undergone tremendous urban growth, causing urban heat islands, groundwater depletion, air pollution, loss of ecosystem services, etc. This study evaluates the variance and heterogeneity in land surface temperature (LST) because of LULC changes in Abha-Khamis Mushyet, Saudi Arabia, from 1990 to 2020. The research aims to determine the impact of urban biophysical parameters on the HighÂHigh (HÂH) LST cluster using geospatial, statistical, and machine learning techniques. The support vector machine (SVM) was used to map LULC. The land surface temperature (LST) has been derived using the mono-window algorithm (MWA). The local indicator of spatial associations (LISA) model was implemented on the spatiotemporal LST maps to identify LST clusters. Also, the parallel coordinate plot (PCP) approach was employed to examine the relationship between LST clusters and urban biophysical variables as a proxy of LULC. LULC maps show that urban areas rose by > 330% between 1990 and 2020. Built-up areas had an 83.6% transitional probability between 1990 and 2020. In addition, vegetation and agricultural land have been transformed into built-up areas by 17.9% and 21.8% respectively between 1990 and 2020. Uneven LULC changes in terms of built-up areas lead to increased LST hotspots. High normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) was linked to LST hotspots but not normalized difference water index (NDWI) or normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This research could help policymakers develop mitigation strategies for urban heat islands.

On the one hand, this new approach effectively simulated the temporal and spatial distribution of the PM2.5 concentration with an10-fold cross-validation R2 of 0.76 and screened out four major pollution characteristics. On the other hand, it effectively captured the short-term population mobility risk. Short-term population mobility increased the PM2.5 exposure risk by 0.30~0.97 times, even keeping PM2.5 concentration unchanged. After combining PM2.5 concentration and population mobility simultaneously, four major PM2.5 exposure risk modes were identified. 6.5% of the areas of Nanjing were at high risk, and 23.0% were at low risk. During the 14th Five Year Plan, it is suggested that the government should speed up the application of modern science and technology in environmental protection and implement gridding and differentiated policies on air pollution risk control to promote human health.

Among all trajectory analysis techniques in mobile IoT, classifying moving device trajectories is a fundamental research problem due to its importance for numerous important mobile IoT applications such as travel demand analysis and animal migration patterns. However, existing classification methods for moving object trajectories either are dynamic programming problems (such as similarity-based methods with dynamic time wrapping or Fr&#x00E9;chet distance) with a quadratic time complexity in all cases, or need abundant labeled samples to training classification model, thus limit the scalability of these methods for given resource-constrained mobile IoT devices. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for trajectory classification in mobile IoT with linear time complexity by firstly encoding a trajectory as a vector via deep representation learning, then utilizing a meta-learning based approach to learn the ability of classifying trajectory with few annotated samples.

Therefore, air pollution estimation and prediction are crucial for effecting timely control measures. This paper proposes an ensemble deep particulate forecaster (EDPF) to predict hourly PM2.5 concentrations for a day ahead. Air quality data from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala (an Indian state), is used as a case study to demonstrate the model. The effect of other pollutant concentrations and various meteorological parameters on PM2.5 prediction is first studied using Pearson correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination method. Thus, the most relevant features for the forecast of PM2.5 concentrations are identified. Then preliminary PM2.5 predictions are made using two base predictors: an attention-based convolutional neural network - bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory model (BiLSTM). Finally, a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) model combines the preliminary predictions yielding the final PM2.5 predictions. The proposed model is validated for long-term forecasting of PM2.5 at Thiruvananthapuram, and the model attains root mean squared error of 12.96 Âµg/m3 and mean absolute error of 9.28 Âµg/m3 for forecasting 24 h ahead PM2.5 concentrations. The experimental results demonstrate that the model performs better compared to various deep learning models in the literature. The effectiveness of the model in all four seasons is also evaluated, which reveals winter is the most challenging season to forecast.

The FCM as an interpretable prediction method not only can predict future air quality more accurately, but also can analyze and interpret the affecting of various energy types on the future air quality. As the time delay of various energy consumptions affecting concentration of air pollutants, the quantitative time sequence influencing relationships (causality) in the FCM is mined directly from these data, and the air quality affected by various types of energy consumptions is predicted based on the FCM. Accordingly, the energy types affecting air pollution can be obtained for prior decision of energy consumption structure adjustment. The experimental results in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei show that the FCM modeling is better than Support Vector Regression (SVR), Linear Regression (LR), Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based forecasting, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) methods in predicting air quality affected by energy resources, meanwhile according to the interpretable prediction results of the FCM, we obtain some interesting results and suggestions on energy consumption types in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regions in advance.

Current screening guidelines and eligibility criteria can miss more than 50% of lung cancers, and in some geographic areas, such as East Asia, a large proportion of the missed lung cancers are in never-smokers. Although randomized trials revealed the benefits of screening for people who smoke, these trials generally excluded never-smokers. Thus, the feasibility and effectiveness of lung cancer screening of individuals who never smoked are uncertain. Several known and suspected risk factors for lung cancers in never-smokers such as exposure to secondhand smoke, occupational carcinogens, radon, air pollution, and pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung diseases, and intrinsic factors, such as age, are well noted. In this regard, knowledge of risk factors may make possible quantification and prediction of lung cancer risk in never smokers. It is worth considering if and how never smokers could be included in population-based screening programs. As the implementation of these programs is challenging in many countries owing to multiple factors and the epidemiologic differences by global regions, these issues will need to be evaluated in each country taking into account various factors, including accuracy of risk assessment and cost-effectiveness of screening in never smokers. This report aims to outline current knowledge on risk factors for lung cancer in never smokers to propose research strategies for this topic and initiate a broader discussion on lung cancer screening of never smokers. Similar considerations can be made in current and ex-smokers, which do not fulfill the current screening inclusion criteria, but otherwise are at increased risk. Although screening of never smokers may in the future be effectively conducted, current evidence to support widespread implementation of this practice is lacking.

However, there is growing interest in going beyond black box prediction models to understand discriminatory features of the time series and their associations with outcomes. One promising method is time-series shapelets (TSS), which identifies maximally discriminative subsequences of time series. For example, in environmental health applications TSS could be used to identify short-term patterns in exposure time series (shapelets) associated with adverse health outcomes. Identification of candidate shapelets in TSS is computationally intensive. The original TSS algorithm used exhaustive search. Subsequent algorithms introduced efficiencies by trimming/aggregating the set of candidates or training candidates from initialized values, but these approaches have limitations. In this paper, we introduce Wavelet-TSS (W-TSS) a novel intelligent method for identifying candidate shapelets in TSS using wavelet transformation discovery. We tested W-TSS on two datasets: (1) a synthetic example used in previous TSS studies and (2) a panel study relating exposures from residential air pollution sensors to symptoms in participants with asthma. Compared to previous TSS algorithms, W-TSS was more computationally efficient, more accurate, and was able to discover more discriminative shapelets. W-TSS does not require pre-specification of shapelet length. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Sensors,10.3390/s21175801,0,0,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies have shown that the Random Forest model (RF) has good results in the prediction of PM2.5 concentration at a single station by incorporating the information of surrounding stations. However, the research on the selection of surrounding stations is lack of pertinence, and some existing selection methods are subjective. We proposed a method for optimizing the selection of surrounding stations based on Time-Lag Cross-Correlation (TLCC) analysis in this research. Taking the air quality monitoring station (national-level station) of Shanghai Shiwuchang as an example, a set of RF regression models were constructed to predict the PM2.5 concentration of the station in the next 1 to 24 hours, and the importance of each input factor in the prediction model was compared and analyzed. We found that the current PM2.5 concentration of the prediction station would significantly impact the prediction of the next 1 to 16 hours, while the wind direction was crucial for the prediction of the next 17 to 24 hours. As the forecast time increased, PM2.5 concentration of the surrounding stations significantly improved in importance ranking, and the impact of different stations was significantly different when forecasting at different times. Therefore it was treated differently when modeling. The comparison results showed that the prediction model established by the method of selected surrounding stations proposed in this paper not only had certain advantages in accuracy (12-hour and 24-hour forecast RMSE decreased by 11.8% and 13.3%), but the false alarm ratio also decreased significantly (the forecasted false alarm ratio for 12 hours and 24 hours dropped by 16.1% and 25.6%).

No doubt, machine learning algorithms based on artificial neural network and support vector machine (SVM), such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial base and linear base are the most reliable and widely employed data mining tools for air pollution modelling. However, ensemble learning techniques, such as random forest (RF), bagging, additive regression (AR) have recently emerged as efficient machine learning tools. In view of prediction modelling, the study employs independent classifiers, such as RF, SVM, regression tree using M5 algorithm (M5P) and simple linear regression (SLR) during first phase. Considering the concept of composite modelling, during next phase, all classifiers were combined with AR to assess the prediction performance of each classifier. The study uses emission and meteorological dataset to predict the atmospheric concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The prediction performance of each model was evaluated in terms of correlation coefficient (R2). The model performance was validated by comparing the results of independent classifiers against composite classifiers. The results obtained suggest that adopting independent classifiers within additive regression as base classifiers improve their prediction accuracy and reduce error values.

This knowledge will help to achieve and maintain cleaner air in metropolitan cities. In this paper, air quality index of Indian cities has been forecasted. The time series model is employed to predict individual concentration of each major pollutant causing air pollution. Based on this data, two regression techniques have been used to predict the air quality index.

Additionally, researchers are moving away from using fixed-site data in favor of using mobile monitoring data in a variety of locations to develop hourly empirical models of particulate air pollution. This study compared the differences between long-term (daily average) and short-term (hourly average and 1 s unrefined data) model performance in three different classes of cross validation: randomly, spatially, and spatially temporally.

Particulate Matter (PM2.5) is a type of air pollution that contains of interrupted elements with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 m. For risk assessment and epidemiological investigations, a better knowledge of the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 concentration in a constant space-time area is essential. Conventional spatiotemporal interpolation approaches commonly relying on robust presumption by limiting interpolation algorithms to those with explicit and basic mathematical expression, ignoring a plethora of hidden but crucial manipulating aspects. Many advanced deep learning approaches have been proposed to forecast Particulate Matter (PM2.5). Recurrent neural network (RNN) is one of the popular deep learning architectures which is widely employed in PM2.5 concentration forecasting.

The proposed algorithm is capable of considering both spatial and temporal hidden affecting elements spontaneously. We tested our model using data from daily PM2.5 dimensions taken in the contactual southeast area of the United States in 2009. In the studies, three evaluation matrices were utilized to compare the overall performance of each algorithm: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The experimental results revealed that our proposed TS-GRU model outperformed compared to the other deep learning approaches in terms of forecasting performance.",CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA,10.32604/cmc.2022.021629,0,0,Yes,GRU,,No,"Malaysia,Saudi Arabia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present a machine learning (ML) approach for predicting MI events based on multiple environmental and demographic variables. We derived data on MI events from the KORA MI registry dataset for Augsburg, Germany, between 1998 and 2015. Multivariable predictors include weather and climate, air pollution (PM10, NO, NO2, SO2 and O-3), surrounding vegetation and demographic data. We tested the following ML regression algorithms: decision tree, random forest, multi-layer perceptron, gradient boosting and ridge regression. The models are able to predict the total annual number of MIs reasonably well (adjusted R-2 = 0.62-0.71). Inter-annual variations and long-term trends are captured. Across models the most important predictors are air pollution and daily temperatures. Variables not related to environmental conditions, such as demographics need to be considered as well. This ML approach provides a promising basis to model future MI under changing environmental conditions, as projected by scenarios for climate and other environmental changes.",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,10.5194/nhess-22-3015-2022,0,0,No,,,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, more and more machine-learning-based methods are being used to solve the air-quality-prediction problem, and gated recurrent units (GRUs) are a representative method because of their advantage for processing time-series data. However, in the same air-quality-prediction task, different researchers have always designed different structures of the GRU due to their different experiences. Data-adaptively designing a GRU structure has thus become a problem. In this paper, we propose an adaptive GRU to address this problem, and the adaptive GRU structures are determined by the dataset, which mainly contributes with three steps. Firstly, an encoding method for the GRU structure is proposed for representing the network structure in a fixed-length binary string; secondly, we define the reciprocal of the sum of the loss of each individual as the fitness function for the iteration computation; thirdly, the genetic algorithm is used for computing the data-adaptive GRU network structure, which can enhance the air-quality-prediction result.

Numerous studies have characterized built environment physical features and environmental exposures, but few have examined urban perceptions at geographic scales needed for population-based research. The degree to which urban perceptions are associated with different environmental features, and traditional environmental exposures such as air pollution or urban green space, is largely unknown. Objective: To determine built environment factors associated with safety, lively and beauty perceptions across 56 cities. Methods: We examined perceptions collected in the open source Place Pulse 2.0 dataset, which assigned safety, lively and beauty scores to street view images based on crowd-sourced labelling. We derived built environment measures for the locations of these images (110,000 locations across 56 global cities) using GIS and remote sensing datasets as well as street view imagery features (e.g. trees, cars) using deep learning image segmentation. Linear regression models were developed using Lasso penalized variable selection to predict perceptions based on visible (street level images) and GIS/remote sensing built environment variables. Results: Population density, impervious surface area, major roads, traffic air pollution, tree cover and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed statistically significant differences between high and low safety, lively, and beauty perception locations. Visible street level features explained approximately 18% of the variation in safety, lively, and beauty perceptions, compared to 3-10% explained by GIS/remote sensing. Large differences in prediction were seen when modelling between city (R2 67-81%) versus within city (R2 11-13%) perceptions. Important predictor variables included visible accessibility features (e.g. streetlights, benches) and roads for safety, visible plants and buildings for lively, and visible green space and NDVI for beauty. Conclusion: Substantial within and between city differences in built environment perceptions exist, which visible street level features and GIS/remote sensing variables only partly explain. This offers a new research avenue to expand built environment measurement methods to include perceptions in addition to physical features.",LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,10.1016/j.lurbplan.2021.104257,0,0,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, two models based on deep learning were established to realize the spatiotemporal forecast in the hourly scale of PM2.5 concentration in China: a multi-layer long and short-term memory iterative model and an improved spatial back-propagation neural network (S-BPNN) model. First of all, we based on spatial correlation to divide 1286 air quality monitoring stations across the country in space adaptively and built a multi-layer LSTM iterative model for each region to achieve the PM2.5 concentration forecast of each monitoring site in the next 24 hours. Secondly, the improved S-BPNN spatialization model was applied to realize the refined mapping of PM2.5 concentration in a large continuous spatial coverage across the country in the next 24 hours. We integrated historical data of PM2.5 monitoring stations in China from 2016 to 2019 for training and verification. The results show that the correlation coefficients R2 of the forecast model and the spatialized model are respectively 0.88 and 0.89, indicating that the two models could achieve high accuracy.

The empirical results reveal that (1) street view greenness could enhance life satisfaction at residence, but depress life satisfaction at workplace; (2) mixed land-use could positively contribute to life satisfaction at both residence and workplace; and (3) there exist positive interactions between greenness and mixed land-use.

In response to such a situation, alternative energy sources should be evaluated, especially on a regional basis. The recent pandemic and its effects show that the effective and widespread use of green energy sources should be increased, because air pollution causes an increased rate of COVID19 virus transmission. It is necessary to re-plan all sustainable energy resources on a regional basis because of the negative environmental impacts of burning fossil energy. On a global scale, there is an initiative to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions related to renewable energy sources by 70% by 2050. In many applications, efficiency analysis and new technologies are among the primary topics. As the rate of urbanization rises, there is a great need for integrated new energy technologies that control local energy efficiency standards for cities, or even buildings. Urban planning is crucial to reducing energy use in buildings. Turkey aims to install 34 gigawatts (GW) of hydroelectric capacity, 20GW of wind energy, 5GW of solar energy, and 1GW power from geothermal or biomass-based on strategic green energy plans. Turkey will provide about 30 % of its total energy needs via renewable energy sources based on this plan by 2023. As is known, one of the most important sustainable energy sources is solar power derived from solar radiation. Solar power has a characteristic pattern compared to other sustainable energy sources, not only in seasonal but also in daily terms. The geographical requirements, vast flat terrain, and high irradiation levels of solar power plants make it ideal for promoting economic growth in the Central Anatolian inner regions of technological investments. In this study, we present estimations based on model results for the monthly variation of solar energy potential, efficiency. Study areas are in the vicinity of Ankara (Camlidere and Kecioren) in Central Anatolia. To forecast solar energy potential, hourly solar radiation (watt/m2) was processed with five years of data (from 2014 to 2018). Deep learning methodologies were applied to solar radiation data to build up future solar radiation data scenarios in 5-year forecast through the end of 2024. A 3-layer artificial neural network (ANN) consisting of 128-neurons with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation was applied to the solar data. An LSTM layer using 64 neurons with ReLU activation functions for each neuron, was applied to build the hidden layer up. The output layer was built on the hidden dense layer using 2-neurons with a linear activation function. Solar power efficiency and performance of ANN models in the annual basin are presented in two study areas.

In the scientific literature, many methods exist for machine learning (ML)-based PM prediction, though their quality is difficult to compare because, among other things, they use different data sets and evaluate the resulting predictions differently. For a new data set, it is not apparent which of the existing prediction methods is best suited. In order to ease the assessment of said models, we present evalPM, a framework to easily create, evaluate, and compare different ML models for immission-based PM prediction. To achieve this, the framework provides flexibility regarding data sets, input features, target variables, model types, hyperparameters, and model evaluation. It has a modular design consisting of several components, each providing at least one required flexibility. The individual capabilities of the framework are demonstrated using 16 different models from the related literature by means of temporal prediction of PM concentrations for four European data sets, showing the capabilities and advantages of the evalPM framework. In doing so, it is shown that the framework allows fast creation and evaluation of ML-based PM prediction models. © 2023, The Author(s).",Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,10.1007/s10661-023-11996-y,0,0,No,,,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study focuses on predicting the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration. This enables individuals to be aware of their immediate surroundings in advance, reducing their exposure to high concentrations of fine particulate matter. The research area includes Keelung City and Xizhi District in New Taipei City, located in northern Taiwan. This study establishes five fine prediction models based on machine-learning algorithms, namely, the deep neural network (DNN), M5’ decision tree algorithm (M5P), M5’ rules decision tree algorithm (M5Rules), alternating model tree (AMT), and multiple linear regression (MLR). Based on the predictive results from these five models, the study evaluates the optimal model for forecast horizons and proposes a real-time PM2.5 concentration prediction system by integrating various models. The results demonstrate that the prediction errors vary across different models at different forecast horizons, with no single model consistently outperforming the others. Therefore, the establishment of a hybrid prediction system proves to be more accurate in predicting future PM2.5 concentration compared to a single model. To assess the practicality of the system, the study process involved simulating data, with a particular focus on the winter season when high PM2.5 concentrations are prevalent. The predictive system generated excellent results, even though errors increased in long-term predictions. The system can promptly adjust its predictions over time, effectively forecasting the PM2.5 concentration for the next 12 h. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14121817,0,0,Yes,,,,Taiwan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The process from air pollutant emission to individual exposure is however complex and nonlinear, which poses significant modeling challenges. This study aims to develop an exposure assessment model that can strike a balance between accuracy, complexity, and usability. In this regard, neural networks offer one possible approach. This study employed a custom-designed pruned feed-forward neural network (pruned-FNN) approach to calculate the air pollution exposure index based on emission time and rates, terrain factors, meteorological conditions, and proximity measurements. The model’s performance was evaluated by cross-validating the estimated exposure indexes with ground-based monitoring records. The pruned FNN can predict pollution exposure indexes (PEIs) that are highly and stably correlated with the monitored air pollutant concentrations (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients for tenfold cross-validation (mean ± standard deviation: 0.906 ± 0.028) and for random cross-validation (0.913 ± 0.024)). The predicted values are also close to the ground truth in most cases (95.5% of the predicted PEIs have relative errors smaller than 10%) when the training datasets are sufficiently large and well-covered. The pruned-FNN method can make accurate exposure estimations using a flexible number of variables and less extensive data in a less money/time-consuming manner. Compared to other exposure assessment models, the pruned FNN is an appropriate and effective approach for exposure assessment that covers a large geographic area over a long period of time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,10.1007/s10661-023-11814-5,0,0,No,,,,"United States,China,United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: Of the 3059 counties, the average asthma prevalence was 9.9 (standard deviation ± 0.99). The GWRF outperformed the conventional random forest. We found an indication, for example, that temperature was inversely associated with asthma prevalence, while poverty showed positive associations. The partial dependence plots showed that these associations had a non-linear shape. Ranking the socio-physical environmental factors concerning their global importance showed that smoking prevalence and depression prevalence were most relevant, while green space and limited language were of minor relevance. The local variable importance measures showed striking geographical differences. Conclusion: Our findings strengthen the evidence that socio-physical environments play a role in explaining asthma prevalence, but their relevance seems to vary geographically. The results are vital for implementing future asthma prevention programs that should be tailor-made for specific areas. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",International Journal of Health Geographics,10.1186/s12942-023-00343-6,0,0,No,,,,"United States,South Korea,Netherlands,Iran",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such a context, accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration is critical for raising public awareness, allowing sensitive populations to plan ahead, and providing governments with information for public health alerts. This study applies a novel hybridization of extreme learning machine (ELM) with a snake optimization algorithm called the ELM-SO model to forecast PM2.5 concentrations. The model has been developed on air quality inputs and meteorological parameters. Furthermore, the ELM-SO hybrid model is compared with individual machine learning models, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), XGBoost, and a deep learning model known as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), in forecasting PM2.5 concentrations. The study results suggested that ELM-SO exhibited the highest level of predictive performance among the five models, with a testing value of squared correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0.928, and root mean square error of 30.325 µg/m3. The study's findings suggest that the ELM-SO technique is a valuable tool for accurately forecasting PM2.5 concentrations and could help advance the field of air quality forecasting.

The accurate assessment of PM2.5 concentrations plays a pivotal role in facilitating prompt responses by pertinent regulatory bodies to mitigate air pollution. Additionally, it furnishes indispensable information for epidemiological studies concentrating on PM2.5 exposure. In recent years, predictive models based on deep learning (DL) have offered promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of air quality forecasts when compared to other approaches. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have proven to be effective in time series forecasting tasks, including air pollution prediction. However, optimizing LSTM models for enhanced accuracy and efficiency remains an ongoing research area. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the novel binary chimp optimization algorithm (BChOA) with LSTM networks to optimize air pollution prediction models. The proposed BChOA, inspired by the social behavior of chimpanzees, provides a powerful optimization technique to fine-tune the LSTM architecture and optimize its parameters. The evaluation of the results is performed using cross-validation methods such as the coefficient of determination ((Formula presented.)), accuracy, the root mean square error (RMSE), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Additionally, the performance of the BChOA-LSTM model is compared against eight DL architectures. Experimental evaluations using real-world air pollution data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed BChOA-based LSTM model compared to traditional LSTM models and other optimization algorithms. The BChOA-LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy of 96.41% on the validation datasets, making it the most successful approach. The results show that the BChOA-LSTM architecture performs better than the other architectures in terms of the (Formula presented.) convergence curve, RMSE, and accuracy. © 2023 by the authors.",Electronics (Switzerland),10.3390/electronics12183985,0,0,Yes,,,,"United States,Spain,Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exploration of factors and mechanisms influencing air quality has garnered considerable attention and produced a substantial body of research. Nonetheless, the absence of effective research tools has resulted in a limited understanding of the nonlinear interactive effects of multiple factors on air quality, as well as their patterns and spatiotemporal variability characteristics. Furthermore, the efficacy of multifactor joint control strategies in practical air pollution management remains inadequate. A novel regional air environmental quality prediction model was developed utilizing a neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) in deep learning based on an analysis of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of regional air environmental quality in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YEB). The model results were attributed and interpreted by integrating the SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) method, focusing on the possible interactive effects and synergistic driving mechanisms of PM2.5 and O3 as the main pollutants and other factors on the air quality index (AQI) in a quantitative way, respectively. The SHAP interaction values of five factor pairs, namely PM2.5 and temperature, PM2.5 and precipitation, O3 and temperature, O3 and NO2, and O3 and PM2.5, are depicted in dependence scatter plots that exhibit three distinct trajectory shapes, namely linear, U-shaped, and irregular. The linear pattern of the dependence scatter plots for PM2.5 and precipitation in the YEB, midstream, and downstream regions, as well as for O3 and temperature in the upstream region, is evident. The irregular patterns of PM2.5 and precipitation, O3 and NO2, O3 and PM2.5 in the upstream, and PM2.5 and temperature in the downstream are observed to be correspondingly related. Additionally, a U-shaped pattern is exhibited by O3 and temperature in the YEB, midstream and downstream, PM2.5 and temperature in the upstream and midstream, O3 and NO2 in the YEB, midstream and downstream, and O3 and PM2.5 in the YEB. Of the three models, the U-shaped model's identification of inflection points and corresponding quantitative determination of factor thresholds hold greater practical implications for decision-making in air environment management. This pattern suggests that the synergistic effect of factor pairs initially decreases with changes in each factor but subsequently begins to increase after reaching inflection points. It is anticipated that this research will contribute to the advancement of theoretical inquiry into the nonlinear multifactor interaction effect and synergistic driving model of regional air quality. Additionally, it is expected to furnish a valuable foundation for decision-making in the development of joint air pollution prevention and control strategies aimed at addressing compound air pollution issues. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Atmospheric Environment,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.120077,0,0,Yes,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PM10 measurements were collected from a remote agricultural monitoring site situated in the southern part of the region and outside the industrial basin over a 12-year period (2010–2021). The ongoing reduction in lignite production during the last decade resulted in considerable changes in particulate emissions in the area. To take into account the changes in the air quality of the region the whole period was divided into two subperiods of common air pollution characteristics. For each period, Hidden Markov Models clustering was applied to the deseasonalized daily PM10 concentrations and the corresponding diurnal amplitudes to extract groups of similar characteristics (clusters) and define the background pollution. The average background concentration was estimated at 15.9 μg/m3 during the period 2010–2015 followed by a decrease of 3.1 μg/m3 to 12.8 μg/m3 during the second study period (2016–2021). The examination of the long-term changes in the background concentration revealed a statistically significant decreasing annual trend of −0.39 μg/m3 that reflected the air quality improvement of the region during the last decade. Additionally, background concentrations co-existed with favorable meteorological conditions such as higher wind speeds during the cold period (October–March) diminishing the contribution of local anthropogenic emissions (biomass burning for heating purposes) and a less developed mixing layer during the warm period (April–September) impeding the impact of the particulate plumes from the nearby power plants. © 2023 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",Atmospheric Pollution Research,10.1016/j.apr.2023.101877,0,0,Yes,,,,Greece,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nowadays, deploying an air pollution monitoring network in many urban areas could provide real-time air quality assessment. However, these networks are usually sparsely distributed and the sensor calibration problems that may appear over time lead to missing and wrong measurements. There is an increasing interest in developing air quality modelling methods to minimize measurement errors, predict spatial and temporal air quality, and support more spatially-resolved health effect analysis. This research aims to evaluate the ability of three feed-forward neural network architectures for the spatial prediction of air pollutant concentrations using the measures of an air quality monitoring network. In addition to these architectures, Support Vector Machines and geostatistical methods (Inverse Distance Weighting and Ordinary Kriging) were also implemented to compare the performance of neural network models. The evaluation of the methods was performed using the historical values of seven air pollutants (Nitrogen monoxide, Nitrogen dioxide, Sulphur dioxide, Carbon monoxide, Ozone, and particulate matters with size less than or equal to 2.5 μ m and to 10 μ m) from an urban air quality monitoring network located at the metropolitan area of Madrid (Spain). To assess and compare the predictive ability of the models, three estimation accuracy indicators were calculated: the Root Mean Squared Error, the Mean Absolute Error, and the coefficient of determination. FFNN-based models are superior to geostatistical methods and slightly better than Support Vector Machines for fitting the spatial correlation of air pollutant measurements.

The spatial and temporal generalisability of image-based pollution models is crucial in their real-world application, but is currently understudied, particularly in low-income countries where infrastructure for measuring the complex patterns of pollution is limited and modelling may therefore provide the most utility. We employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for two complementary classification models, in both an end-to-end approach and as an interpretable feature extractor (object detection), to estimate spatially and temporally resolved fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and noise levels in Accra, Ghana. Data used for training the models were from a unique dataset of over 1.6 million images collected over 15 months at 145 representative locations across the city, paired with air and noise measurements. Both end-to-end CNN and object-based approaches surpassed null model benchmarks for predicting PM2.5 and noise at single locations, but performance deteriorated when applied to other locations. Model accuracy diminished when tested on images from locations unseen during training, but improved by sampling a greater number of locations during model training, even if the total quantity of data was reduced. The end-to-end models used characteristics of images associated with atmospheric visibility for predicting PM2.5, and specific objects such as vehicles and people for noise. The results demonstrate the potential and challenges of image-based, spatiotemporal air pollution and noise estimation, and that robust, environmental modelling with images requires integration with traditional sensor networks. © 2023 The Authors",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166168,0,0,Yes,,,,"United Kingdom,United States,Ghana,Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, the outbreak of COVID-19 has brought challenges to the medical system, which placed higher demands on preventing lung diseases and improving diagnostic efficiency to some extent. Artificial intelligence can alleviate the burden on the medical system by analyzing lung sound signals to help to diagnose lung diseases. The existing models for lung sound recognition have challenges in capturing the correlation between time and frequency information. It is difficult for convolutional neural network to capture multi-scale features across different resolutions, and the fusion of features ignores the difference of influences between time and frequency features. To address these issues, a lung sound recognition model based on multi-resolution interleaved net and time-frequency feature enhancement was proposed, which consisted of a heterogeneous dual-branch time-frequency feature extractor (TFFE), a time-frequency feature enhancement module based on branch attention (FEBA), and a fusion semantic classifier based on semantic mapping (FSC). TFFE independently extracts the time and frequency information of lung sounds through a multi-resolution interleaved net and Transformer, which maintains the correlation between time-frequency features. FEBA focuses on the differences in the influence of time and frequency information on prediction results by branch attention.

In all, the authors tested the proposed GRU-ED method with four models: Model 1: Vehicle population + Emission [no meteorological (VE)], Model 2: Meteorological + Emission [no vehicle population (ME)], Model 3: Meteorological + Vehicle population [no emission (MV)], and Model 4: Meteorological + Vehicle population + Emission (MVE). It is observed that the proposed GRU-ED method performed better than traditional machine learning predictive methods (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) in terms of forecast value accuracy. The GRU-ED method with Model 4 is found to be the most accurate forecasting model for 1-hourly PM2.5 concentration prediction (R2 = 0.959, NSE = 0.953, MAE = 1.770, RRMSE = 0.002, and MAPE = 0.190). It is also observed that among the meteorological, vehicle, and emission parameters, the presence of the meteorological parameter has a significant impact on the prediction accuracy. © 2023",Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139278,0,0,Yes,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although both models produced results that showed >90% correlation with the test sample measures, they also showed that Neural Prophet provides a 70% improvement in accuracy over the Prophet model for the performance indicators MAE, MAPE, and MASE.

However, the lack of high-resolution remote sensing retrieval parameters for gaseous pollutants (sulfur dioxide and ozone) limits the simulation effect to a 1 km resolution. To address this issue, we sequentially generated and optimized the spatial distributions of near-surface PM2.5, SO2, and ozone at a 1 km resolution in China through two approaches. First, we employed spatial sampling, random ID, and parameter convolution methods to jointly optimize a tree-based machine-learning gradient-boosting framework, LightGBM, and improve the performance of spatial air pollutant simulations. Second, we simulated PM2.5, used the simulated PM2.5 result to simulate SO2, and then used the simulated SO2 to simulate ozone. We improved the stability of 1 km-resolution SO2 and ozone products through the proposed sequence of multiple-pollutant simulations. The cross-validation (CV) of the random sample yielded an R2 of 0.90 and an RMSE of 9.62 µg∙m−3 for PM2.5, an R2 of 0.92 and an RMSE of 3.9 µg∙m−3 for SO2, and an R2 of 0.94 and an RMSE of 5.9 µg∙m−3 for ozone, which are values better than those in previous related studies. In addition, we tested the reliability of PM2.5, SO2, and ozone products in China through spatial distribution reliability analysis and parameter importance reliability analysis. The PM2.5, SO2, and ozone simulation models and multiple-air-pollutant (MuAP) products generated by the two optimization methods proposed in this study are of great value for long-term, large-scale, and regional-scale air pollution monitoring and predictions, as well as population health assessments. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15245705,0,0,Yes,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we introduce a novel ensemble learning-based hindcast modeling method that incorporates information on predictors in periods without PM2.5 observations into the modeling process to enhance the reliability of daily estimates for those unmonitored historical years. Our proposed method constructs the annually varying relationship between PM2.5 and the predictors during periods without PM2.5 observations, differing from previous hindcast modeling procedures where the PM2.5-predictors relationship established was assumed to be the same between periods with and without PM2.5 observations. Using PM2.5 heavily polluted northern China from 2013 to 2020 as an example, our history-informed machine-learning hindcast model outperformed the state-of-the-art method by a large margin, improving the leave-one-year-out cross-validation (CV) R2 [ root-mean-square error (RMSE)] from 0.56 [34.66 μg/m3] to 0.63 [31.79 μg/m3] a daily scale, while achieving a comparable sample-based 10-fold CV R2 [(RMSE] of 0.90 [16.85 μg/m3]. In addition, incorporating satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) into the hindcast modeling further improved the historical PM2.5-predictors relationship and provided more reliable estimates during periods without PM2.5 observations, increasing the leave-one-year-out CV R2 [RMSE] from 0.61 [30.31 μg/m3] for the model without AOD to 0.65 [28.56 μg/m3]. Consequently, our proposed hindcast modeling framework enables the production of more reliable PM2.5 estimates during periods without PM2.5 observations and holds promise for application to other regions and air pollutants with longer predictor data compared to the response variable data. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Atmospheric Environment,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119994,0,0,Yes,,,,"China,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though satellite-borne column NO2 is widely used to acquire surface concentration through the integration of sophisticated models, long-term and full-coverage estimation is hindered by the incomplete retrieval of satellite data. Moreover, the mechanical relationship between surface and tropospheric NO2 is often ignored in the context of machine learning (ML) approach. Here we develop a gap-filling method to obtain full-coverage column NO2 by fusing satellite data from different sources. The surface NO2 is then estimated during 2007–2020 in China using the XGBoost model, with daily out-of-sample cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.75 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 9.11 μg/m3. The back-extrapolation performance is verified through by-year CV (daily R2 = 0.60 and RMSE = 11.46 μg/m3) and external estimations in Taiwan before 2013 (daily R2 = 0.69 and RMSE = 8.59 μg/m3). We explore the variable impacts in three hotspots of eastern China through SHAP (Shapley additive explanation) values. We find the driving contributions of column NO2 to the variation of ground pollution during 2007–2020 (average SHAP = 5.09 μg/m3 compared with the baseline concentration of 33.39 μg/m3). The estimated effect is also compared with ordinary least squares (OLS) model to provide a straightforward understanding.

Federated learning (FL), also known as privacy by design, is a new paradigm in machine learning (ML). However, FL models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, similar to other AI models. In this paper, we propose federated adversarial training (FAT) strategies to generate robust global models that are resistant to adversarial attacks. We apply two adversarial attack methods, projected gradient descent (PGD) and the fast gradient sign method (FGSM), to our air pollution dataset to generate adversarial samples. We then evaluate the effectiveness of our FAT strategies in defending against these attacks. Our experiments show that FGSM-based adversarial attacks have a negligible impact on the accuracy of global models, while PGD-based attacks are more effective. However, we also show that our FAT strategies can make global models robust enough to withstand even PGD-based attacks. For example, the accuracy of our FAT-PGD and FL-mixed-PGD models is 81.13% and 82.60%, respectively, compared to 91.34% for the baseline FL model. This represents a reduction in accuracy of 10%, but this could be potentially mitigated by using a more complex and larger model. Our results demonstrate that FAT can enhance the security and privacy of sustainable smart city applications. We also show that it is possible to train robust global models from modest datasets per client, which challenges the conventional wisdom that adversarial training requires massive datasets. © 2023 by the authors.",Future Internet,10.3390/fi15110371,0,0,No,,,,"Taiwan,Indonesia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, designing an automated model for monitoring and predicting air quality becomes more and more relevant, particularly in urban regions. Air pollution can significantly affect the environment and eventually citizens’ health. In this paper, one of the popular machine learning algorithms, the neural network algorithm, is employed to classify different species of air pollutants. To boost the performance of the traditional neural network, the war strategy optimization algorithm tunes the neural network’s parameters.

However, the accuracy of model-predicted estimates can suffer from extrapolation problems associated with limited measurement data to train the machine learning algorithms. In this study, we developed and evaluated two approaches, incorporating low-cost sensor data, that enhanced the extrapolating ability of random-forest models in areas with sparse monitoring data. Rochester, NY is the area of a pregnancy-cohort study. Daily PM2.5 concentrations from the NAMS/SLAMS sites were obtained and used as the response variable in the model, with satellite data, meteorological, and land-use variables included as predictors. To improve the base random-forest models, we used PM2.5 measurements from a pre-existing low-cost sensors network, and then conducted a two-step backward selection to gradually eliminate variables with potential emission heterogeneity from the base models. We then introduced the regression-enhanced random forest method into the model development. Finally, contemporaneous urinary 1-hydroxypyrene was used to evaluate the PM2.5 predictions generated from the two approaches. The two-step approach increased the average external validation R2 from 0.49 to 0.65, and decreased the RMSE from 3.56 μg/m3 to 2.96 μg/m3. For the regression-enhanced random forest models, the average R2 of the external validation was 0.54, and the RMSE was 3.40 μg/m3. We also observed significant and comparable relationships between urinary 1-hydroxypyrene levels and PM2.5 predictions from both improved models.

As monitoring indoor PM2.5 concentrations on a large scale is challenging, it is urgent to assess population-level exposure and related health risks to develop an easy-to-use and generalized model to predict indoor PM2.5 concentrations and spatiotemporal variations at the global level. Existing machine learning models of indoor PM2.5 are prone to deliver single-point predictions, and their input strategies are not widely applicable. Here, we developed a Bayesian neural network (BNN) model for predicting the distribution of daily average urban residential PM2.5 concentration based on multiple data sources available from nationwide comprehensive sensor-monitoring records in China. The BNN model showed good performance with a 10-fold cross-validation R2 of 0.70, mean-absolute-error of 9.45 μg/m3, root-mean-square error of 13.3 μg/m3, and 95 % prediction interval coverage of 85 %. To demonstrate the application process, this model was applied to predict indoor PM2.5 concentrations on a large spatiotemporal scale. Our modeled population-weighted annual indoor PM2.5 concentration for China in 2019 was 22.8 μg/m3, far exceeding the WHO standard.

To address this, the current study employed the prophet model to forecast HHW quantities based on the Integration of Two Networks systems in Shanghai. HHW classification was performed using HVGGNet structures, which were based on VGG and transfer learning. To expedite the process of finding the optimal global learning rate, the method of cyclical learning rate was adopted, thus avoiding the need for repeated testing. Results showed that the average rate of HHW generation was 0.1 g/person/day, with the most significant waste categories being fluorescent lamps (30.6 %), paint barrels (26.1 %), medicine (26.2 %), battery (15.8 %), thermometer (0.03 %), and others (1.22 %).

However, their performance in predicting the maximum daily 8-h averaged ozone (MDA8 O3), the metric often used for O3 pollution assessment and management, is relatively poorer. This is largely resulted from more irregular data fluctuations of the MDA8 O3 levels governed collectively by the synoptic condition, local photochemistry, and long-range transport. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of MDA8 O3, this study developed a secondary decomposition ML model framework which coupled the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) as the primary decomposition, the variational mode decomposition (VMD) as secondary decomposition, and the gate recurrent unit (GRU) ML model. By applying this secondary decomposition model framework on MDA8 O3 prediction for the first time, we showed that the prediction accuracy of MDA8 O3 is largely improved from R2 of 0.46 and RMSE of 30.4 μg/m3 for GRU without decomposition to R2 of 0.91 and RMSE of 12.6 μg/m3 over the Pearl River Delta of China. We also found that the prediction accuracy rate of O3 pollution non-attainments, an essential indicator for initiating contingency O3 pollution control, improved greatly from 14.9 % for GRU without decomposition to 72.5 %. The performance of O3 pollution non-attainment prediction is relatively higher in southwestern PRD, which is mainly due to greater number and severity of O3 non-attainments in southwestern cities located downwind of the emission hotspot area at central PRD. This study underscored the importance of secondary decomposition in accurately predicting daily-scale O3 concentration and non-attainments over the PRD, which can be extended to other photochemically active region worldwide to improve their O3 prediction accuracy and assist in O3 contingency control. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166963,0,0,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, quantifying the impact of anthropogenic interventions on NH3 dynamics is challenging, as both meteorology and chemistry mask the real changes in observed NH3 concentrations. Here, we applied machine learning techniques based on random forest models to decouple the impacts of meteorology and emission changes on the gaseous NH3 and ammonium aerosol (NH4 +) concentrations in Beijing during the lockdown. Our results showed that the meteorological conditions were unfavorable during the lockdown and tended to cause an increase of 8.4 % in the NH3 concentration. In addition, significant reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions could also elevate NH3 concentrations by favoring NH3 gas-phase partitioning. However, the observed NH3 concentration significantly decreased by 35.9 % during the lockdown, indicating a significant reduction in emissions or enhanced chemical sinks. Rapid gas-to-particle conversion was indeed found during the lockdown. Thus, the observed reduced NH3 concentrations could be partially explained by the enhanced transformation into NH4 +. Therefore, the sum of NH3 and NH4 + (collectively, NHx) is a more reliable tracer than NH3 or NH4 + alone to estimate the changes in NH3 emissions. Compared to that under the scenario without lockdowns, the NHx concentration decreased by 26.4 %.

However, a lack of high-quality data sources, such as satellite-based aerosol optical depth before 2000, has resulted in a gap in spatiotemporally resolved PM2.5 data for historical periods. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, we leveraged the light gradient boosting model to capture the spatiotemporal association between PM2.5 concentrations and multi-source geospatial predictors. Augmented PM2.5 from PM10 measurements expanded the spatiotemporal representativeness of the ground measurements. Observations before and after 2009 were used to train and test the models, respectively. Our model showed fair prediction accuracy from 2010 to 2019 [the ranges of coefficients of determination (R2) for the grid-based cross-validation are 0.71-0.85] and commendable back extrapolation performance from 1998 to 2009 (the ranges of R2 for the independent external testing are 0.32-0.65) at the daily level. The pollution episodes in the 1980s and pollution levels in the 1990s were also reproduced by our model. The 4-decade PM2.5 estimates demonstrated that most regions in England witnessed significant downward trends in PM2.5 pollution.

ML algorithms provide promising results for air pollution prediction. In the existing scientific literature, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predictive models, as well as their combination with other statistical and machine learning approaches, have been utilized for air pollution prediction. However, these combined algorithms may not always provide suitable results due to the stochastic nature of the factors that influence air pollution, improper hyperparameter configurations, or inadequate datasets and data characterized by great variability and extreme dispersion. The focus of this paper is applying and comparing the performance of Support Vector Machine and hybrid LSTM regression models for air pollution prediction. To identify optimal hyperparameters for the LSTM model, a hybridization with the Genetic Algorithm is proposed. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, the bagging technique is employed on the best LSTM model. The proposed predicitive model aims to determine the Common Air Quality Index level for the next hour in Niksic, Montenegro. With the hybridization of the LSTM algorithm and by applying the bagging technique, our approach aims to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of hourly air pollution prediction. The major contribution of this paper is in the application of advanced machine learning analysis and the combination of the LSTM, Genetic Algorithm, and bagging techniques, which have not been previously employed in the analysis of air pollution in Montenegro.

Accurate forecasting can help minimize its hazardous implications well in time. Air Quality forecasting is a complex problem in the domain of time series data forecasting. In this paper we propose a novel customized air quality forecaster developed using Gated Recurrent Unit network-based Encoder-Decoder model (GRUED) of Deep Learning using Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation for forecasting air pollutant concentrations of Delhi, India. The unique composition and customization of our air quality forecaster is a more efficient and better state of the art model for pollutant concentration prediction than its counterparts. Experimental results are indicative that the proposed model outperforms the conventional Deep Learning models. The proposed model was made to forecast air pollutant concentrations of SO2, CO, NO2 and O3. Each pollutant forecast was evaluated by computing MAE and RMSE metrices. MAE values for SO2, CO, NO2 and O3 forecasts were 60.63%, 26.83%, 33.2% and 31.33% lesser for our GRUED model as compared to conventional LSTM model.

Accurate air quality predictions are critical to human health. However, it is difficult to extract spatiotemporal features among complex spatiotemporal dependencies effectively. Most existing methods focus on constructing multiple spatial dependencies and ignore the systematic analysis of spatial dependencies. We found that besides spatial proximity stations, functional similarity stations, and temporal pattern similarity stations, the shared spatial dependencies also exist in the complete spatial dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model, the spatiotemporal adaptive attention graph convolution model, for city-level air quality prediction, in which the prediction of future short-term series of PM2.5 readings is preferred. Specifically, we encode multiple spatiotemporal dependencies and construct complete spatiotemporal interactions between stations using station-level attention. Among them, we design a Bi-level sharing strategy to extract shared inter-station relationship features between certain stations efficiently. Then we extract multiple spatiotemporal features with multiple decoders, which it is extracted from the complete spatial dependencies between stations. Finally, we fuse multiple spatiotemporal features with a gating mechanism for multi-step predictions.

To better understand the impact of wildfire smoke on air quality, we developed a modeling system to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations attributed to both fire smoke and nonsmoke sources across the contiguous U.S. We found that wildfire smoke has the most significant impact on air quality in the West Coast, followed by the Southeastern U.S. Between 2007 and 2018, fire smoke contributed over 25% of daily PM2.5 concentrations at ∼40% of all regulatory air monitors in the EPA’s air quality system (AQS) for more than one month per year. People residing outside the vicinity of an EPA AQS monitor (defined by a 5 km radius) were subject to 36% more smoke impact days compared with those residing nearby. Lowering the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for annual mean PM2.5 concentrations to between 9 and 10 μg/m3 would result in approximately 35-49% of the AQS monitors falling in nonattainment areas, taking into account the impact of fire smoke. If fire smoke contribution is excluded, this percentage would be reduced by 6 and 9%, demonstrating the significant negative impact of wildland fires on air quality. © 2023 The Authors.

Reducing this major burden on global health requires a better understanding of the etiology, risk factors, and course of the disorder. With the goal of improving the prevention, recognition, and appropriate management of depressive disorders in China, the China Depression Cohort Study will establish a nationally representative sample of at least 85,000 adults (the China Depression Cohort Study-I) and 15,000 middle school students (the China Depression Cohort Study-II) and follow them over time to identify factors that influence the onset, characteristics, and course of depressive disorders. This protocol describes the China Depression Cohort Study-I. Methods: A multistage stratified random sampling method will be used to identify a nationally representative community-based cohort of at least 85,000 adults (i.e., ≥ 18 years of age) from 34 communities in 17 of mainland China’s 31 provincial-level administrative regions. Baseline data collection includes 1) demographic, social and clinical data, 2) diagnostic information, 3) biological samples (i.e., blood, urine, hair), 4) brain MRI scans, and 5) environmental data (e.g., community-level metrics of climate change, air pollution, and socio-economic characteristics). Baseline findings will identify participants with or without depressive disorders. Annual reassessments will monitor potential risk factors for depression and identify incident cases of depression. Cox Proportional-Hazards Regression, Network analysis, Disease trajectory modelling, and Machine learning prediction models will be used to analyze the collected data. The study’s main outcomes are the occurrence of depressive disorders; secondary outcomes include adverse behaviors (e.g., self-harm, suicide), the recurrence of depression and the incidence other mental disorders. Discussion: The China Depression Cohort Study-I will collect a comprehensive, nationally representative set of individual-level and community-level variables over time. The findings will reframe the understanding of depression from a ‘biology-psychology-society’ perspective. This perspective will improve psychiatrists’ understanding of depression and, thus, promote the development of more effective subgroup-specific antidepressant drugs and other interventions based on the new biomarkers and relationships identified in the study.

Quantifying the air pollution experimentally is quite a challenging task as it depends on many parameters viz., wind speed, wind temperature, relative humidity, temperature etc. It requires the investment of huge money and manpower for controlling air pollution. Machine learning technique-based computer modelling reduces both of the parameters.

We efficiently use the parameter’s spatiotemporal correlation by concatenating the dataset with time series. The predicted PM2.5 concentration was based on meteorology changes over a period. Therefore, the accuracy would increase with the period growing. By extracting the intrinsic features between meteorological and PM2.5 concentration, a fast and accurate prediction was carried out.

Predicting PM2.5 concentrations and controlling emissions are crucial for pollution prevention and control. This study proposes a comprehensive solution based on weight-sharing deep learning and multi-objective optimization. The proposed approach first utilizes a model that combines the Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network to analyze data from 13 air quality monitoring stations in Xi'an City. By simultaneously inputting data from different monitoring stations, the model can extract highly correlated spatiotemporal features, enabling accurate predictions of PM2.5 concentrations for specific monitoring stations using LSTM. In addition, a multi-objective optimization model is established with the primary goal of achieving maximum total emission reduction. This model takes into account four key factors: the total emission reduction, the task of emission reduction, the government subsidy, and the total cost of emission reduction. To obtain the emission reduction of PM2.5 concentration at 13 monitoring stations, 5 classical intelligence algorithms are employed to solve the model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed prediction model, with an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 12.820 and a fitting coefficient (R2) of 0.907, outperforming all comparison models. The proposed model exhibits strong generalization ability, making it applicable to different time and space conditions. Furthermore, it can be adapted for calculating emission reduction of other air pollutants. Lastly, the multi-objective optimization model achieves significant success in terms of total emission reduction.

Here, the space-time extreme gradient boost model (STXGB) was enhanced by integrating spatiotemporal information to obtain the spatial resolution and overall accuracy of VOCs. To this end, meteorological, topographical and pollutant emissions, was input to the STXGB model, and regional hourly 300 m VOCs maps for 2020 in Shanghai were produced. Our results show that the STXGB model achieve good hourly VOCs estimations performance (R2 = 0.73). A further analysis of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) regression indicate that local interpretations of the STXGB models demonstrate the strong contribution of emissions on mapping VOCs estimations, while acknowledging the important contribution of space and time term.

Economic development drives rapid industrialization and urbanization, which are significant sources of air pollution in developing countries. Kuwait’s rapid urbanization and vehicular traffic, along with dust storms, make it a prime location for research for environmental pollution. Keeping this in view, a study was designed to evaluates various machine learning prediction methods for particulate matter concentrations (PM10) in Kuwait. The prediction models were developed using three different algorithms, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR). The models were developed using a 3-year dataset collected by Kuwait Environmental Public Authority (K-EPA) for two stations selected in this study (Al-Ahmadi and Al-Salam). The performance of the models was evaluated using various metrics, including Mean Biased Error (MBE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (nRMSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). The results show that both stations experienced severe air quality issues and that particulate matter concentrations (PM10) are strongly influenced by the different meteorological and pollutant variables. The findings show that for the Al-Ahmadi location, artificial neural networks (ANN) (Rcal2 = 0.885, Rval2 = 0.775) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) (Rcal2 = 0.895, Rval2 = 0.613) were good, while for Al-Salam, KNN (Rcal2 = 0.945, Rval2 = 0.715) was a better choice to predict PM10 . These models can be used by the decision-makers to impose pollution controls, evaluate policies, or plan targeted actions to reduce particle matter. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.",International Journal of Information Technology (Singapore),10.1007/s41870-023-01521-2,0,0,Yes,,,,"Kuwait,Jordan,United Kingdom,India",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feature importance analysis illustrated that air change rate (ACR) has the greatest impact on the VOC concentration levels. We applied three multi-feature (temperature, relative humidity, ACR) deep learning models to predict the VOC concentrations over ten days in the residence, indicating that the long short-term memory (LSTM) model owns the best performance, with predictions the closest to the observed data, compared with the other two models, i.e., recurrent neural network (RNN) model and gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. We also found that human activities could significantly affect VOC emissions in some observed erupted peaks.

Because nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are the principal pollutants, many models for forecasting their potential harm have been created. Nonetheless, making precise predictions is nearly impossible. The prediction of air pollution enables researchers to understand how pollution affects human health. Deteriorating air quality can lead to respiratory diseases such as lung cancer and asthma. The effect of pollution on environmental degradation can also be predicted and reductions can be detected in the ozone layer. This study also focuses on and promotes the development of smart city environments by obtaining influential pollutants that affect the air, thereby reducing the source of specific pollutants An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is used as a forecast the pollution and the starling murmuration optimization (SMO) procedure is used to optimise the Artificial Neural Network strictures to achieve a lower forecasting error. Furthermore, in this research work, we used real time dataset as we have used Winsen ZPHS01B sensor module to collect the data, which is stored in cloud platform. After the composed data is used to train and test, after this process we will evaluate the results. To assess the performance of the suggested model. Furthermore, the perfect has been tested using two alternative kinds of input parameters: type as, which contains various lagged values of variables (NO2 and SO2), and type as, which only includes lagged values of the yield variables. The collected findings suggest that the projected model is more precise than existing joint forecasting benchmark models when different network input variables are considered. © 2023 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

The current study focuses on identifying the most suitable spatial resolution using hexagonal tessellations of different sizes over the study area. Hexagonal grids are selected after comparing different types of grids. Spatial interpolation methods, including inverse distance weighting and ordinary Kriging method, are used for creating augmented datasets for each grid. A hybrid deep-learning-based prediction model is developed combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) for multivariate time series regression to predict PM2.5. Three scenarios are considered based on the size of the hexagonal grids. The results from each model are compared using evaluation indices of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The R2 values range from 0.8 to 0.95, which shows that the hybrid model gives accurate predictions. Analysis of models for different-sized grids shows that for 1, 3, and 5 km grid sizes, 17%, 24%, and 6% of the cells have RMSE values less than 20, respectively. Similarly, 39%, 50%, and 46% of the cells have MAE values less than 16 for 1, 3, and 5 km grid sizes, respectively. The comparison showed that the 3 km grid benefits data aggregation per prediction accuracy and computational time. The predictive capability of models is not dependent on the spatial relationship between data from different static monitors. In the future, mobile monitoring data can be included to increase the data points and models’ accuracy. © 2023 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",Atmospheric Pollution Research,10.1016/j.apr.2023.101887,0,0,Yes,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have identified risk factors using regression-based and ensemble models. However, studies that consider complex relationships and interactions among these factors have yet to be conducted. Although deep learning algorithms can address this problem, further research on modeling and interpreting the results is warranted. Methods: In this study, from 2015 to 2019, information about air pollutants, weather conditions, pollen, and influenza were utilized to predict the number of emergency room patients and outpatients with asthma using recurrent neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit models. The relative importance of the environmental factors in asthma exacerbation was quantified through a feature importance analysis. Results: We found that LSTM was the best algorithm for modeling patients with asthma. Our results demonstrated that influenza, temperature, PM10, NO2, CO, and pollen had a significant impact on asthma exacerbation. In addition, the week of the year and the number of holidays per week were an important factor to model the seasonality of the number of asthma patients and the effect of holiday clinic closures, respectively. Conclusion: LSTM is an excellent algorithm for modeling complex epidemiological relationships, encompassing nonlinearity, lagged responses, and interactions. Our study findings can guide policymakers in their efforts to understand the environmental factors of asthma exacerbation. © 2023, The Author(s).",Respiratory Research,10.1186/s12931-023-02616-x,0,0,No,,,,"South Korea,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We estimated spatiotemporal exposure to surface air temperature and pollution (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3) at high spatiotemporal resolution (daily, 250 m) for 2018–2020 in Catalonia. Innovations include the use of TROPOMI products, a data split for remote sensing gap-filling evaluation, estimation of prediction uncertainty, and use of explainable machine learning. We compiled meteorological and air quality station measurements, climate and atmospheric composition reanalyses, remote sensing products, and other spatiotemporal data. We performed gap-filling of remotely-sensed products using Random Forest (RF) models and validated them using Out-Of-Bag (OOB) samples and a structured data split. The exposure modelling workflow consisted of: 1) PM2.5 station imputation with PM10 data; 2) quantile RF (QRF) model fitting; and 3) geostatistical residual spatial interpolation. Prediction uncertainty was estimated using QRF. SHAP values were used to examine variable importance and the fitted relationships. Model performance was assessed via nested CV at the station level. Evaluation of the gap-filling models using the structured split showed error underestimation when using OOB. Temperature models had the best performance (R2 =0.98) followed by the gaseous air pollutants (R2 =0.81 for NO2 and 0.86 for O3), while the performance of the PM2.5 and PM10 models was lower (R2 =0.57 and 0.63 respectively). Predicted exposure patterns captured urban heat island effects, dust advection events, and NO2 hotspots. SHAP values estimated a high importance of TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 columns in PM and NO2 models, and confirmed that the fitted associations conformed to prior knowledge. Our work highlights the importance of correctly validating gap-filling models and the potential of TROPOMI measurements. Moderate performance in PM models can be partly explained by the poor station coverage. Our exposure estimates can be used in epidemiological studies potentially accounting for exposure uncertainty. © 2023 The Author(s)",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122501,0,0,Yes,,,,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COVID-19 infections have spread to most countries, but certain regions have had more infections and casualties than others. It is yet unclear what causes these variances specifically. This motivates us to investigate, the association between air pollutants, metrological indices, and COVID-19 cases and deaths. We collected the daily air pollution, metrological and COVID-19 infected cases data and predicted the respiratory casualty. In this study, we assess the impact of air pollution and the metrological indicators on the respiratory infection casualty. First, we assessed how air pollution and metrological parameters correlate to respiratory infection transmission. Our findings highlight that temperature, wind speed, and particulate matter (PM2.5) positively correlate to respiratory virus transmission. In this study, an Enhanced Regularization Function in the Artificial neural networks (ERF-ANN) model predicts respiratory casualty. The ERF-ANN model was found to have minimal errors when predicting respiratory casualties over the rest. We conclude that respiratory infection transmission prefers low temperatures and polluted air. This system will alert chronic patients early based on their environment, and all disease groups will be notified. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.",International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management,10.1007/s13198-023-02050-8,0,0,No,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the worsening of air pollution, urban agglomerations face an increasingly complex environment for air quality monitoring, hindering sustainable and high-quality development in China. More effective methods for predicting air quality are urgently needed. In this study, we employed seven single models and ensemble learning algorithms and constructed a hybrid learning algorithm, the LSTM-SVR model, totaling eight machine learning algorithms, to predict the Air Quality Index in six major urban agglomerations in China. We comprehensively compared the predictive performance of the eight algorithmic models in different urban agglomerations. The results reveal that, in areas with higher levels of air pollution, the situation for model prediction is more complicated, leading to a decline in predictive accuracy. The constructed hybrid model LSTM-SVR demonstrated the best predictive performance, followed by the ensemble model RF, both of which effectively enhanced the predictive accuracy in heavily polluted areas. Overall, the predictive performance of the hybrid and ensemble models is superior to that of the single-model prediction methods.

According to observation data from monitoring stations, the concentration of near-surface ozone (O3) in China has gradually increased in recent years, and ozone concentration often exceeds the contaminant limit standard, especially in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. High O3 concentration pollution will adversely affect crop growth, which can cause crop yield losses. Therefore, it is urgent to recognize the situation of ozone pollution in the BTH region and quantitatively evaluate the crop yield losses caused by ozone pollution to develop more effective pollution prevention and control policies. However, the monitoring of ozone concentration in China started relatively late compared with some developed countries, and currently, long-time series data covering the BTH region cannot be obtained, which makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of ozone on crop yield. Therefore, a new method (WRFC-XGB) was proposed in this study to establish a high-precision near-surface O3 concentration dataset covering the whole BTH region from 2014 to 2019 by integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model with the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm. Through verification with ground observation station data, the results of WRFC-XGB are satisfactory, and R2 can reach 0.78–0.91. Compared with other algorithms, the accuracy of the near-surface ozone concentration dataset is greatly improved, which can be used to estimate the impact of surface ozone on crop yield. Based on this dataset, the yield loss of winter wheat, rice, and maize caused by O3 pollution was estimated by using the response equation of the relative yield and ozone dose index. The results showed that the total yield losses of winter wheat, rice and maize from 2014 to 2019 were 2659.21 million tons, 49.23 million tons and 1721.56 million tons due to ozone pollution in the BTH region, respectively, and the highest relative yield loss of crops caused by O3 pollution could be 29.37% during 2014–2019, which indicated that the impact of ozone pollution on crop yield cannot be ignored, and effective measures need to be developed to control ozone pollution, prevent crop production loss, and ensure people's food security. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122334,0,0,Yes,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Determining accurate distribution models of pollutants is crucial for establishing safe distances between sectors and urban regions and continuously monitoring pollutant levels. This study was conducted in Siraf City, situated in the Pars special energy zone in southern Iran, to improve the accuracy of simulation results and identify the correlation between emission models and pollutant concentrations. To achieve this goal, concentrations of seven pollutants (CO, CO2, NO2, SO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10) were determined seasonally at 45 points within the study area using field sampling and numerical simulation with AERMOD software. Subsequently, the obtained results were seamlessly transferred into new domains with the primary objective of feature engineering. These engineered features were then fed into an XGBoost model for regression analysis to obtain coefficients, deriving seven equations to enhance pollutant concentration simulations' accuracy significantly. The developed equations improved the simulation accuracy for CO (12.54%), CO2 (12.91%), NO2 (0.94%), SO2 (6.7%), O3 (3.05%), PM2.5 (12.47%), and PM10 (4.62%).

For this purpose, meteorological and PM10 data obtained from the stations Parque 35, sustained by Celulose Riograndense (CMPC), and A-801, sustained by the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), were used. The ANN used for the simulation was of the Multilayer Perceptron type, trained by the backpropagation algorithm with cross-validation. The results obtained indicate that the simulation was satisfactory with a Nash–Sutcliffe index (NSE) of 0.64, a linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.81, a relative error (Er) of 26% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.40 µg/m3. Thus, even with some difficulty in estimating extreme concentrations, the model was suitable for the largest range observed, of 10 µg/m3 to 50 µg/m3.

Furthermore, air pollution has enormous social costs that we all bear in the form of premature deaths, low productivity, sick leave, and other strains on the healthcare system. The primary sources of air pollution are traffic, home fires, and industry. Measuring NO2 levels in air pollution reveals the extent of pollution caused by traffic, particularly diesel vehicles, which are the primary source of NO2. COVID-19 rates are rising in areas with high levels of air pollution, according to mounting evidence. Toxic contaminants can make people more susceptible to COVID-19. The causal relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 cases has yet to be established, but experts warn that long-term exposure will undoubtedly make people more susceptible to lung infections. Air pollution has been linked to an increase in cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, asthma, and other comorbidities by inducing cellular damage and inflammation throughout the body. All of these factors increase the risk of death in COVID-19 patients. As a result, air quality parameters must be predicted and monitored.

The emission-based chemical transport models (CTM) are broadly used to predict O3 formation, but they may deviate from observations due to input uncertainties such as emissions and meteorological data, in addition to the treatment of O3 nonlinear chemistry. In this study, an innovative recurrent spatiotemporal deep-learning (RSDL) method with model-monitor coupled convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNN) has been developed to improve O3 predictions of CTM. The RSDL method was first used to build the ConvRNN within a 24-h scale to characterize the spatiotemporal relationships between the monitored O3 data and CTM simulations, and then incorporated the recurrent pattern to achieve 72-h multi-site forecasts based on a pilot study over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. The results showed that the RSDL method predicted O3 with high accuracy over this case study, with an increase of 27.54% in the correlation coefficient (R) average for all sites as well as an increase in R of 0.14–0.21 for all cities compared to CTM. Moreover, the regional distribution of CTM was further improved by the RSDL predictions with the data fusion technique, which greatly reduced the underpredictions of O3 concentrations, particularly in high O3-level areas (concentrations >160 μg/m3), with a 33.55% reduction in the mean absolute error (MAE). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122291,0,0,Yes,,,,"China,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, achieving accurate predictions is challenging due to the complexity of the transport and dispersion processes involved, which are influenced by multiple factors, including atmospheric pollutants, meteorological conditions, and geographic features. To address this challenge, we developed a novel framework for PM2.5 prediction that utilizes multiple edges for feature extraction and employs a multi-gated graph neural network for feature calculations. The model utilizes multiple edges, created by combining an atmospheric diffusion coefficient with a PM2.5 similarity metric, to elucidate the complex characteristics of PM2.5 interactions between different monitoring stations. Node features are computed by aggregating connected nodes' features, weighted by these multi-faceted edges. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional time-series prediction models in the mid-to-long-term prediction of PM2.5 concentrations (96 h in advance), with improvements in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 2.613%, Critical Success Index (CSI) by 3.143%, and R-squared (R2) by 5.263%.

This study analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 concentration anomalies over the past 39 years (1980–2018) in winter (November to January) over eastern China based on the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method. Regression analysis is conducted on external forcing factors such as sea ice, sea temperature, and snow cover in the pre-autumn (September to October) using the time series of the first three modes. Nine key factors were selected, which further led to establishing a model for predicting winter PM2.5 concentration in eastern China using the long short-term memory deep learning algorithm (LSTM). Independent verification revealed that the predicted and observed PM2.5 concentration distributions were consistent, with the absolute value of deviation within 15 μg·m−3 between 2016 and 2018. The correlation coefficients between the predicted and observed values were between 0.42 and 0.93 over eight key cities in the past 10 years (2009–2018). The contribution rates of the nine factors to PM2.5 concentration were calculated to explore their impact on PM2.5 concentration during winter. The Arctic sea ice (ASI) was found to be the key contributor to the winter PM2.5 concentration in eastern China. The predictors can be monitored in real time; hence, the model provides a real-time predictive tool, improving the prospects of predicting seasonal PM2.5 pollution, especially in vulnerable regions such as eastern China. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166989,0,0,Yes,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response, tens of millions of short-term radon measurements have been conducted in residential buildings over the past three decades either for disclosure or to initially evaluate the need for mitigation. These measurements, however, are currently underutilized to assess population radon exposure in epidemiological studies. Based on two relatively small radon surveys, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory developed a state-of-the-art national radon model. However, this model only provides coarse and invariant radon estimations, which limits the ability of epidemiological studies to accurately investigate the health effects of radon, particularly the effects of acute exposure. This study involved obtaining over 2.8 million historical short-term radon measurements from independent laboratories. With the use of these measurements, an innovative spatial random forest (SRF) model was developed based on geological, architectural, socioeconomical, and meteorological predictors. The model was used to estimate monthly community-level radon concentrations for ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the United States from 2001 to 2020. Via cross-validation, we found that our ZCTA-level predictions were highly correlated with observations. The prediction errors declined quickly as the number of radon measurements in a ZCTA increased. When ≥15 measurements existed, the mean absolute error was 24.6 Bq/m3, or 26.5% of the observed concentrations (R2 = 0.70). Our study demonstrates the potential of the large amount of historical short-term radon measurements that have been obtained to accurately estimate longitudinal ZCTA-level radon exposures at unprecedented levels of resolutions and accuracy. © 2023 American Chemical Society",Environmental Science and Technology,10.1021/acs.est.2c08840,0,0,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional reliance on linear correlation coefficients for ascertaining PM2.5-related factors only uncovers superficial relationships. Moreover, the invariance of conventional prediction models restricts their accuracy. To enhance the precision of PM2.5 concentration prediction, this study introduces a novel integrated model that leverages feature selection and a clustering algorithm. Comprising three components—feature selection, clustering, and integrated prediction—the model first employs the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) to identify the most impactful features affecting PM2.5 concentration within air pollutants and meteorological factors. This step offers more valuable feature data for subsequent modules. The model then adopts a two-layer clustering method (SOM+K-means) to analyze the multifaceted irregularity within the dataset. Finally, the model establishes the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) weak learner for each classification, integrating multiple weak learners using the AdaBoost algorithm to obtain a comprehensive prediction model. Through feature correlation enhancement, data irregularity exploration, and model adaptability improvement, the proposed model significantly enhances the overall prediction performance. Data sourced from 12 Beijing-based monitoring sites in 2016 were utilized for an empirical study, and the model’s results were compared with five other predictive models. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed model significantly heightens prediction accuracy, offering useful insights and potential for broadened application to multifactor correlation concentration prediction methodologies for other pollutants. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14101482,0,0,Yes,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In major metropolitan areas, there was an estimated decrease of 50 to 90 percent in transit use. The secondary effect of the COVID-19 lockdown was expected to improve air quality, leading to a decrease in respiratory diseases. The present study examines the impact of mobility on air quality during the COVID-19 lockdown in the state of Mississippi (MS), USA. The study region is selected because of its non-metropolitan and non-industrial settings. Concentrations of air pollutants—particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), particulate matter 10 (PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen oxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO)—were collected from the Environmental Protection Agency, USA from 2011 to 2020. Because of limitations in the data availability, the air quality data of Jackson, MS were assumed to be representative of the entire region of the state. Weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction) were collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USA. Traffic-related data (transit) were taken from Google for the year 2020. The statistical and machine learning tools of R Studio were used on the data to study the changes in air quality, if any, during the lockdown period. Weather-normalized machine learning modeling simulating business-as-scenario (BAU) predicted a significant difference in the means of the observed and predicted values for NO2, O3, and CO (p < 0.05). Due to the lockdown, the mean concentrations decreased for NO2 and CO by −4.1 ppb and −0.088 ppm, respectively, while it increased for O3 by 0.002 ppm. The observed and predicted air quality results agree with the observed decrease in transit by −50.5% as a percentage change of the baseline, and the observed decrease in the prevalence rate of asthma in MS during the lockdown. This study demonstrates the validity and use of simple, easy, and versatile analytical tools to assist policymakers with estimating changes in air quality in situations of a pandemic or natural hazards, and to take measures for mitigating if the deterioration of air quality is detected. © 2023 by the authors.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,10.3390/ijerph20116022,0,0,Yes,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meteorological and emissions factors, which considerably affect the PM2.5 concentrations in the atmosphere, vary substantially under different climate change scenarios. In this work, global PM2.5 concentrations from 2021 to 2100 were generated by combining the deep learning technique, reanalysis data, emission data, and bias-corrected CMIP6 future climate scenario data. Based on the estimated PM2.5 concentrations, the future premature mortality burden was assessed using the Global Exposure Mortality Model. Our results reveal that SSP3-7.0 scenario is associated with the highest PM2.5 exposure, with a global concentration of 34.5 μg/m3 in 2100, while SSP1-2.6 scenario has the lowest exposure, with an estimated of 15.7 μg/m3 in 2100. PM2.5-related deaths for individuals under 75 years will decrease by 16.3 and 10.5% under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, from 2030s to 2090s. However, premature mortality for elderly individuals (>75 years) will increase, causing the contrary trends of improved air quality and increased total PM2.5-related deaths in the four SSPs.

For this prediction, many indicators can be employed to reflect the air quality, among which air quality index (AQI) is the most commonly used. However, existing methods are relatively simple and the corresponding prediction accuracy needs to be improved. Particularly, the prediction accuracy is affected by the parameter selection of methods, and the corresponding optimization problems are usually non-convex and multi-modal. Therefore, based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network with improved jellyfish search optimizer (IJSO), a novel hybrid model denoted by IJSO-LSTM is proposed to predict AQI for Chengdu. In order to evaluate the optimizing ability of IJSO, other variants of jellyfish search optimizer as well as other state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms are applied to optimize the hyperparameters of LSTM neural network for comparison, and the results confirm that IJSO is more suitable for optimizing LSTM neural network. In addition, compared with other well-known models, the results demonstrate IJSO-LSTM has higher prediction accuracy with root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error controlling below 4, 3, and 4%, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1007/s11356-023-26782-z,0,0,Yes,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Commonly, ground-based monitoring networks are established to measure the PM2.5 concentrations in highly populated regions and protected areas such as national parks, yet large gaps exist in spatial coverage. Satellite-derived aerosol optical properties serve to complement the missing spatial information of ground-based monitoring networks. However, satellite remote sensing AODs are hampered under cloudy/hazy conditions or during nighttime. Here we strive to overcome the long-standing restriction that surface PM2.5 cannot be obtained with satellite remote sensing under cloudy/hazy conditions or during nighttime. In this work, we introduce a deep spatiotemporal neural network (ST-NN) and demonstrate that it can artfully fill these observational gaps. We quantified the quantitative impact of input variables on the results using sensitivity and visual analysis of the model. This technique provides ground-level PM2.5 concentrations with a high spatial resolution (0.01°) and 24-h temporal coverage, hour-by-hour, complete coverage. In central and eastern China, the 10-fold cross-validation results show that R2 is between 0.8 and 0.9, and RMSE is between 6 and 26 (µg m−3). The relative error varies in different concentration ranges and is generally less than 20%.

Therefore, PM 2.5 , as the main pollutant, is an important research object of air pollution at present. Effectively improving the prediction accuracy of PM 2.5 volatility makes the PM 2.5 prediction content perfect, which is an important aspect of PM 2.5 concentration research. The volatility series has an inherent complex function law, which drives the volatility movement. When machine learning algorithms such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) are used for volatility analysis, a high-order nonlinear form is used to fit the functional law of the volatility series, but the time-frequency information of the volatility has not been utilized. Based on EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) technique, GARCH (Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model and machine learning algorithms, a new hybrid PM 2.5 volatility prediction model is proposed in this study. This model realizes time-frequency characteristic extraction of volatility series through EMD technology, and integrates residual and historical volatility information through GARCH model. The simulation results of the proposed model are verified by comparing the samples of 54 cities in North China with the benchmark models. The experimental results in Beijing showed that MAE (mean absolute deviation) of hybrid-LSTM decreased from 0.00875 to 0.00718 compared with LSTM, and hybrid-SVM based on the basic model SVM also significantly improved generalization ability, and its IA (index of agreement) improved from 0.846707 to 0.96595, showing the best performance. The experimental results show that the hybrid model is superior to other considered models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, which verifies that the hybrid system modeling method is suitable for PM 2.5 volatility analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1007/s11356-023-26834-4,0,0,Yes,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposed a twinned gradient boosting machine (GBM) to analyze the impact of environmental parameters on the spread, recovery, and mortality rate of this virus in India. The proposed paper exploited the four weather parameters (temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed) and two air pollution parameters (PM2.5 and PM10) as input to predict the infection, recovery, and mortality rate of its spread. The algorithm of the GBM model has been optimized in its four distributions for best performance by tuning its parameters. The performance of the GBM is reported as excellent (where R2 = 0.99) in training for the combined dataset comprises all three outcomes i.e. infection, recovery and mortality rates.

Random forest (RF), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), naïve Bayes (NB), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models were tested among others for better prediction accuracy, kappa statistic, sensitivity, and specificity. k-Nearest neighbors and linear discriminant analysis models yielded an accuracy of 85% relatively. The best model sensitivity of 100% was obtained with the k-nearest neighbor model, and a moderate kappa statistic was gained by the LDA model. As far as the model specificity is concerned, QDA yielded a value of 100%. Geographically weighted regression was applied to know the effect of spatial component across the data, and we obtained R 2 value of 0.63 with a moderate Akaike Information Criterion along with a minimal condition number reflecting the stability of the model. The disease prevalence variable was classified into high and low levels and was fed into the ML framework. The risk/susceptibility maps were produced with relative weights, and spatial distribution maps were presented. We conclude that though the ML and geographic information system–based tools can be used invariably, sufficient data is essential to generate a model with higher accuracy in terms of evaluation metrics, and geographically weighted regression at multiscale can also aid in knowing the characteristics of the model performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Air Quality, Atmosphere and Health",10.1007/s11869-023-01366-5,0,0,No,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study compares ML models to deep learning models and emphasizes the explain ability of ML models for PM2.5 prediction. Materials and methods: We examine different combinations of features and time window dimensions to evaluate the performance of ML models. It utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), and five Ensemble Models (EL) including AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Random Forest (RF). The dataset includes three years of daily measurements of weather parameters and PM2.5. Results: Lagged values of PM2.5 improves prediction performance, particularly when the lagged value window size spans seven days or multiples thereof. This confirms that road traffic, which exhibits a weekly seasonality, is the primary source of PM2.5 in Algiers. Interestingly, including lagged values of weather parameters decreases prediction performance, even when chosen based on their correlation with PM2.5. The AdaBoost model performs the best, achieving a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.899 µg/m³ and an R2 value of 0.96. Conclusion: EL models, specifically AdaBoost, exhibit strong performance in predicting PM2.5 levels. They not only provide accurate predictions but also allow analysis of feature importance. Lagged values of PM2.5 have a greater impact on predictions compared to weather parameters. Surprisingly, including weather parameters hampers prediction performance. Therefore, the utilization of ensemble learning models offers valuable insights into feature significance. © 2023 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.",Journal of Air Pollution and Health,10.18502/japh.v8i3.13783,0,0,Yes,,,,"Algeria,France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate prediction can help people reduce exposure risks and promote environmental pollution control. However, most previous studies have ignored the spatial spillover of air pollution, i.e., that the current region’s air quality is also correlated with that of geographically adjacent areas. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative spatiotemporal hybrid early warning system based on adaptive feature extraction and improved fuzzy cognition maps. Firstly, a spatial spillover analysis model based on the Moran index and local gravitational clustering was proposed to capture the diffusion and concentration characteristics of air pollution between regions. Then, an adaptive feature extraction model based on an optimized Hampel filter was put forward to process and correct the outliers in the original series. Finally, a hesitant fuzzy information optimized fuzzy cognitive maps model was proposed to forecast the air quality of urban agglomeration. The experimental results show that the air quality forecasting accuracy of urban agglomerations can be significantly improved when the geographical conditions and other interactions among cities are comprehensively considered, and the proposed model outperformed other benchmarks and can be used as a powerful analytical tool during urban agglomeration air quality management. © 2023 by the authors.",Systems,10.3390/systems11060286,0,0,No,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Out of many pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the pollutant that affects the urban atmospheric environment to the greatest extent. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration prediction is of great significance to human health and environmental protection. This paper proposes a CNN-SSA-DBiLSTM-attention deep learning fusion model. This paper took the meteorological observation data and pollutant data from eight stations in Bijie from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2022 as the sample data for training and testing. For the obtained data, the missing values and the data obtained from the correlation analysis performed were first processed. Secondly, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the feature selection. DBILSTM was then used to establish a network model for the relationship between the input and actual output sequences, and an attention mechanism was added to enhance the impact of the relevant information. The number of units in the DBILSTM and the epoch of the whole network were optimized using the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and the predicted value was the output after optimization. This paper predicts the concentration of PM2.5 in different time spans and seasons, and makes a comparison with the CNN-DBILSTM, BILSTM, and LSTM models. The results show that the CNN-SSA-DBiLSTM-attention model had the best prediction effect, and its accuracy improved with the increasing prediction time span. The coefficient of determination (R2) is stable at about 0.95. The results revealed that the proposed CNN-SSA-DBiLSTM-attention ensemble framework is a reliable and accurate method, and verifies the research results of this paper in regard to the prediction of PM2.5 concentration.

While some governments have recently banned open burning at municipal facilities, monitoring the success of mitigation strategies has been challenging due to the lack of adequate air pollution monitoring methodologies. To address this, we have developed a machine learning approach that utilizes high-resolution (3 m/pixel) satellite imagery and applied the methodology to detect plumes of smoke from waste burning on Thilafushi in the Maldives. We employed an image classification and semantic segmentation model based on a pretrained convolutional neural network to identify and locate plumes within images. Our approach achieved an average intersection over union (overlap) of 0.70 between visually identified plumes and the machine learning output as well as a pixel-level classification accuracy of 96.3% on our holdout testing data. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning models in detecting plumes from sources where measurements are not available, including wildfires, coal-fired power plants, and industrial plumes, as well as in tracking the progress of mitigation strategies. © 2023 The Authors.

This study examines the spatiotemporal distribution of PM2.5 concentrations and their relationship with meteorological factors in six major Chinese urban agglomerations from 2017 to 2020, using daily average data. Statistical and spatial analysis techniques are employed, alongside the construction of eight machine learning models for prediction purposes. The study also compares the feature importance of various meteorological factors impacting PM2.5 concentrations. Results reveal significant regional differences in both average PM2.5 levels and meteorological influences. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model demonstrates the highest prediction accuracy for PM2.5 concentrations. According to the MLP model’s feature importance identification, temperature is the most significant factor affecting PM2.5 concentrations across all urban agglomerations, while wind speed and precipitation have the least impact. Contributions from air pressure and dew point temperature, however, vary among different urban agglomerations. This research considers the impact of urban agglomerations and meteorological conditions on PM2.5 and also offers valuable artificial intelligence-based insights into the key meteorological factors influencing PM2.5 concentrations in diverse regions, thereby informing the development of effective air pollution control policies. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14050903,0,0,Yes,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the machine learning (ML) method was used to estimate AQI for Shijiazhuang, China, as the research object, and pollutants and meteorological factors as data models. Specifically, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Random Forest (RF) models were used. The experimental results show that XGBoost model captures the AQI variation trend well, and the R 2 of XGBoost model is 0.929, which is 0.3% and 2.3% higher than the R2 of RF model and LightGBM model, respectively. In addition, through the SHAP-based model interpretation method, the study reveals the key factors of AQI variation, that is PM2.5 and PM10, play positive roles in the variation of AQI and AQI is less sensitive to meteorological factors.

This study developed an integrated spatiotemporal forecasting architecture incorporating an extensive air quality PM2.5 monitoring network and simultaneously forecasts PM2.5 concentrations at all locations, allowing the monitoring of the health risk associated with exposure to these levels. First, this study uses a graph convolutional layer to incorporate the spatial relationship of the neighboring stations at their current state with real-time measurements. Then, it is coupled to a deep learning temporal model to form the long- and short-term time-series graph convolutional network (LSTGraphNet) model, anticipating high pollutant concentration events.

To be precise, CVML is an innovative hybrid machine learning model, and it can leverage a limited amount of survey data for prediction and data enrichment purposes. The model comprises two interconnected modules: Module I, an unsupervised learning algorithm, and Module II, a supervised learning algorithm. Module I is responsible for grouping the data into groups based on common characteristics, thereby grouping the corresponding dependent variable, whereas Module II is in charge of demonstrating the ability to predict and the capacity to appropriately assign new samples to their respective categories based on input attributes. Taking a survey on the topic of air pollution in Hanoi in 2019 as an example, we found that CVML can predict households’ willingness to pay for polluted air mitigation at a high degree of accuracy (i.e., 98%). We found that CVML can help users reduce costs or save resources because it makes use of secondary data that are available on many open data sources. These findings suggest that CVML is a sound and practical method that could be widely applied in a wide range of fields, particularly in environmental economics and sustainability science.

The outcomes revealed that EBOT exhibited unparalleled accuracy at 97.4%, astutely predicting 75 out of 77 samples. On the other hand, FDT and EBAT achieved accuracies of 96.1% and 94.8%, respectively. Consequently, the EBOT model emerges as the epitome of reliability, showcasing its prowess in forecasting the air quality index. We believe that the insights garnered from this research possess universal applicability, extending their potential to regions worldwide. © 2023 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su151713168,0,0,Yes,,,,"Saudi Arabia,Algeria,Egypt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we aimed to investigate this association using a nationwide survey in South Korea. Method: We examined the association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and chronic sleep deprivation using a national cross-sectional health survey covering the entire 226 districts in inland South Korea from 2008 to 2018, with a machine learning-based national air pollution prediction model with 1 km2 spatial resolution. Results: Chronic sleep deprivation was positively associated with PM2.5 in the total population (odds ratio (OR): 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05–1.13) and sub-population (low, middle, high population density areas with OR: 1.127, 1.09, and 1.059, respectively). The association was consistently observed in both sexes (males with OR: 1.09, females with OR: 1.09)) and was more pronounced in the elderly population (OR: 1.12) than in the middle-aged (OR: 1.07) and young (OR: 1.09) populations. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis regarding the relationship between long-term PM2.5 exposure and chronic sleep deprivation, and the study provides quantitative evidence for public health interventions to improve air quality that can affect chronic sleep conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Environmental Research,10.1016/j.envres.2023.115812,0,0,No,,,,South Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accumulating monitoring station and satellite data make the problem well-suited for quantum machine learning.

A quantum quanvolutional neural network model was developed and compared to a classical spatiotemporal ConvLSTM model using an evaluation framework of baseline models and metrics of per-pixel loss and intersection over union accuracy. The quantum quanvolutional neural network developed successfully generates one-hour-ahead emission concentration forecasts with increasingly lower loss (6.5% and 30.5% less) and higher accuracy (18.4% and 18.6% higher) compared to the input-independent and random baselines at the end of training. The quantum model was also comparable to the classical ConvLSTM model, with slightly lower loss (4%) but also slightly lower accuracy (3.7%).

These short-term and on-road characteristics of mobile measurements become the ubiquitous shortcomings of applying land use regression (LUR) models to estimate long-term concentrations at residential addresses. This issue was previously found to be mitigated by transferring LUR models to the long-term residential domain using routine long-term measurements in the studied region as the transfer target (local scale). However, long-term measurements are generally sparse in individual cities. For this scenario, we propose an alternative by taking long-term measurements collected over a larger geographical area (global scale) as the transfer target and local mobile measurements as the source (Global2Local model). We empirically tested national, airshed countries (i.e., national plus neighboring countries) and Europe as the global scale in developing Global2Local models to map nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in Amsterdam. The airshed countries scale provided the lowest absolute errors, and the Europe-wide scale had the highest R2. Compared to a “global” LUR model (trained exclusively with European-wide long-term measurements), and a local mobile LUR model (using mobile data from Amsterdam only), the Global2Local model significantly reduced the absolute error of the local mobile LUR model (root-mean-square error, 6.9 vs 12.6 μg/m3) and improved the percentage explained variances compared to the global model (R2, 0.43 vs 0.28, assessed by independent long-term NO2 measurements in Amsterdam, n = 90). The Global2Local method improves the generalizability of mobile measurements in mapping long-term residential concentrations with a fine spatial resolution, which is preferred in environmental epidemiological studies. © 2023 The Authors",Environmental Research,10.1016/j.envres.2023.115836,0,0,Yes,,,,"Netherlands,Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Air pollution is often invisible to the eye which can make its detection challenging, unlike the destruction of the land or waterways. Given that air-quality monitoring stations are typically ground-based, their abilities to detect pollutant distributions are often restricted to wide areas. Satellites, however, have the potential for studying the atmosphere at large; the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus project satellite, “Sentinel-5P” is a newly launched satellite capable of measuring a variety of pollutant information with publicly available data outputs. This paper seeks to create a multi-modal machine learning model for predicting air-quality metrics with high precision so that it will be applicable to locations where monitoring stations do not exist. The inputs of this model will include a fusion of ground measurements and satellite data with the goal of highlighting pollutant distribution and motivating change in societal and industrial behaviours. A contemporary method for fusing satellite information with pollution measurements is studied, suggesting that simpler models can work as effectively as neural network models that are constructed with state-of-the-art architectures. A new dataset of continental European pollution monitoring station measurements is created with features including altitude, population density, environmental classification of local areas, and satellite data from the ESA Copernicus project. This dataset is used to train a multi-modal ML model, Air Quality Network (AQNet) capable of fusing these various types of data sources to output predictions of various pollutants. These predictions are then aggregated to create an “air-quality index” that could be used to compare air quality over different regions. Three pollutants, NO2, O3, and PM10, are predicted successfully by AQNet and the network was found to be useful compared to a model only using satellite imagery. It was also found that the addition of supporting tabular data improves predictions. When testing the developed AQNet on out-of-sample data of the UK and Ireland, we obtain satisfactory estimates though on average pollution metrics were roughly overestimated by around 20%. © 2023 The Author(s)",Remote Sensing of Environment,10.1016/j.rse.2023.113609,0,0,Yes,,,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particulate matter (PM) is one of the most important indicators of the severity of air pollution since inhaling particles from coal-fired power generation can be harmful to both the environment and human health. This research aims to appraise relationships between PM and other measurable air quality parameters used as critical information in prevention and control steps. For this purpose, a statistical learning model to estimate PM10 in ambient air was established. A generalized flowchart was created in order to arrive at a generalizable and comprehensive modeling scheme for analyzing air pollution time series data. The main part of the chart, the partial robust regression algorithm aims to provide a reproducible model based on statistical precision, robustness and generality. The comparative experiments performed with heterogeneous data revealed that the suggested robust regression algorithm has better estimation capacity and generality compared with the conventional methods. The results also showed that machine intelligence-based partial robust regression is not very sensitive to data that deviate from normality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Modeling Earth Systems and Environment,10.1007/s40808-022-01612-2,0,0,No,,,,Turkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address these concerns, the government of Canada has collected a large sensor-based dataset containing detailed information on 7384 light-duty vehicles from 2017 to 2021, with the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 40–45% by 2030. To this end, various researchers worldwide have developed vehicle emissions and consumption models to comply with these targets and achieve the Canadian government’s ambitious objectives. In this work, we propose the development of boosting and other regression models to predict carbon dioxide emissions for light-duty vehicle designs, with the aim of creating ensemble learning models that leverage vehicle specifications to forecast emissions. Our proposed boosting model is capable of accurately predicting CO2 emissions, even with only one car attribute as input. Moreover, our regression models, in conjunction with the boosting algorithm, can effectively make predictions from various vehicle inputs. Our proposed technique, categorical boosting (Catboost), provides critical insights into transportation-generated air pollution, offering valuable recommendations for both vehicle users and manufacturers. Importantly, Catboost performs data processing in less time and with less memory than other algorithms proposed in the literature.

Aerosol optical depth (AOD), a crucial optical parameter that assesses the extinction effect of atmospheric aerosols, is frequently used to estimate the extent of air pollution on large scales. So, the better prediction of AOD is crucial for understanding the health impacts of aerosols. The accurate prediction of AOD is difficult due to its nonlinear relationships with other climatic variables, uncertainties, and time series variable characteristics. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) model such as support vector regression (SVR), novel hybrid SVR-GWO model (SVR integrated with gray wolf optimizer (GWO)), and statistical model multi-linear regression (MLR) are used to predict AOD. Also, for SVR-GWO model, SVR hyper-parameters are optimized using meta-heuristic GWO algorithm. Satellite-based data of Pakistan is used for the prediction of AOD on monthly bases. In addition, preprocessing techniques of forward feature selection (FFS) is utilized to select the optimal input features for the SVR-GWO, SVR and MLR models to predict AOD. The performance of the novel hybrid SVR-GWO, SVR, and MLR model is analyzed using RMSE, MAE, RRMSE, R2 and Taylor diagram, and it is found that hybrid SVR-GWO model (RMSE = 0.07, MAE = 0.06, RRMSE = 0.22 and R2= 0.60) is better than ordinary SVR model (RMSE = 0.10, MAE = 0.07, RRMSE = 0.29 and R2= 0.18) and MLR model (RMSE = 0.11, MAE = 0.07, RRMSE = 0.32 and R2= 0.03). Keynotes: (a) The study demonstrates the potential of ML models such as SVR-GWO for accurate prediction of AOD, which can aid in better understanding of the health impacts of aerosols. (b) The use of preprocessing techniques like FFS and optimization algorithms like GWO can significantly improve the performance of the ML (SVR-GWO) model in predicting AOD. (c) The findings of this study can be useful for policymakers and healthcare professionals in identifying regions and populations at risk of aerosol-induced respiratory health issues and designing effective interventions to mitigate them. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.",Acta Geophysica,10.1007/s11600-023-01072-x,0,0,No,,,,Pakistan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A tool named Dose–Response Functions (DRFs) has been developed to estimate this deterioration. DRFs use specific air pollutants and climatic parameters as input data. Existing DRFs in the literature use only ground-based measurements as input data. This fact constitutes a limitation for the application of this tool because it is too expensive to establish and maintain such a large network of ground-based stations for pollution monitoring. In this study, we present the development of new DRFs using only satellite data as an input named Satellite Sensed Data Dose-Response Functions (SSD-DRFs). Due to the global coverage provided by satellites, this new tool for monitoring the corrosion/soiling of materials overcomes the previous limitation because it can be applied to any area of interest. To develop SSD-DRFs, we used measurements from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) on board Aqua and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) on Aura. According to the obtained results, SSD-DRFs were developed for the case of carbon steel, zinc, limestone and modern glass materials. SSD-DRFs are shown to produce more reliable corrosion/soiling estimates than “traditional” DRFs using ground-based data. Furthermore, research into the development of the SSD-DRFs revealed that the different corrosion mechanisms taking place on the surface of a material do not act additively with each other but rather synergistically. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15123194,0,0,No,,,,"Greece,China,United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The test dataset comprises meteorological parameters, air pollutant concentrations, and outpatient hospital visits for respiratory diseases in Linyi, China, from January 1, 2016 to August 20, 2022. We use support vector regression (SVR) to build models that enable analysis of the effect of meteorological factors and air pollutants on the number of outpatient visits for respiratory diseases. Spearman correlation analysis and SVR model results indicate that NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 are correlated with the occurrence of respiratory diseases, with the strongest correlation relating to pneumonia. An increase in the daily average temperature and daily relative humidity decreases the number of patients with pneumonia and chronic lower respiratory diseases but increases the number of patients with acute upper respiratory infections. The SVR modeling has the potential to predict the number of respiratory-related hospital visits. This work demonstrates that machine learning can be combined with meteorological and air pollution data for disease prediction, providing a useful tool whereby policymakers can take preventive measures.

Particulate matter of a diameter smaller than 2.5 and 10 μm (PM2.5 and PM10) significantly determines air quality.

In general, air quality is measured using the air quality index, which records the pollutants level in the air. These recordings are to be mentioned across various places, to know about the air quality level. The advancement of the recent artificial intelligence can be replaced by the human efforts and to automate the system in flowless manner. Hence, an effort has been taken in this paper, by proposing a framework of predicting the air quality seasonally using regularized combinational LSTM (REG-CLSTM).

Aiming at this problem, the proposed model is able to identify the highest concerning pollutants occurrence in individual seasons.

The algorithm can learn concentration patterns because it has been trained on a vast dataset of air quality measurements from various locations. The trained model is then improved using information from a particular target site, customizing it to the features of the target area. Experiments are carried out on a comprehensive dataset containing air pollution measurements from various places to assess the efficacy of the proposed model. The recommended method performs better than standard models at forecasting air pollution levels, proving its dependability in various geographical settings. An interpretability analysis is also performed to learn about the variables affecting air pollution levels. We identify the geographical patterns associated with high pollutant concentrations by visualizing the learned representations within the model, giving important information for environmental planning and mitigation methods. The observations show that the model outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting based on RNNs and transformer-based models. The suggested methodology for forecasting air contaminants has the potential to improve air quality management and aid in decision-making across numerous regions. This helps safeguard the environment and public health by creating more precise and dependable air pollution forecast systems.

Therefore, correctly predicting air quality plays an important effective action plan to mitigate air pollution and create healthier and more sustainable environments. Monitoring and predicting air pollution is crucial to empower individuals to make informed decisions that protect their health. This research presents a comprehensive comparative analysis focused on air quality prediction using three distinct regression techniques- Random Forest regression, Linear regression, and Decision Tree regression.

Because this is a global issue, several nations have established control of air pollution stations in various cities to monitor pollutants like Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10), to notify inhabitants when pollution levels surpass the quality threshold. With the rise in air pollution, it is necessary to construct models to capture data on air pollutant concentrations. Compared to other parts of the world, Africa has a scarcity of reliable air quality sensors for monitoring and predicting Particulate Matter (PM2.5). This demonstrates the possibility of extending research in air pollution control. Methods: Machine learning techniques were utilized in this study to identify air pollution in terms of time, cost, and efficiency so that different scenarios and systems may select the optimal way for their needs. To assess and forecast the behavior of Particulate Matter (PM2.5), this study presented a Machine Learning approach that includes Cat Boost Regressor, Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Decision Tree. Results: Cat Boost Regressor and Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor were implemented to predict the latest PM2.5 concentrations for South African Cities with recording stations using past dated recordings, then the best performing model between the two is used to predict PM2.5 concentrations for South African Cities with no recording stations and also to predict future PM2.5 concentrations for South African Cities. K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier were implemented to create a system predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) Status. Conclusion: This study investigated various machine learning techniques for air pollution to analyze and predict air pollution behavior regarding air quality and air pollutants, detecting which areas are most affected in South African cities.

Air pollution is mobile and can cause long-term effects over large areas, which are detrimental to the natural environment and human body. Haze is a form of air pollution, which comprises PM2.5 components that adversely impair human health. Multiple approaches for predicting PM2.5 in the past have had limited accuracy, meanwhile required vast quantities of data and computational resources. In order to tackle the difficulties of poor fitting effect, large data demand, and slow convergence speed of prior prediction techniques, a PM2.5 prediction model based on the stacking integration method is proposed. This model employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Random Forest (RF) as the base model, while ridge regression is used as the meta-learner to stack. PM2.5 concentration is influenced by a variety of pollutant factors and meteorological factors, and the correlation between PM2.5 concentration and other factors was analyzed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient method. Several significant factors that determine the haze concentration are selected out, and the stacking model is built on this data for training and prediction. The experimental results indicate that the fusion model constructed in this thesis can provide accurate PM2.5 concentration estimates with fewer data features. The RMSE of the proposed model is 19.2 and the R 2 reached 0.94, an improvement of 3–25% over the single model.

A model which could promptly predict urban air quality with considerable accuracy is, therefore, important and will benefit the development of smart cities. However, only a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model could better resolve the dispersion behavior within an urban canyon layer. A machine learning (ML) model using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was formulated in the current study to investigate vehicle-derived airborne particulate (PM10) dispersion within a compact high-rise-built environment. Various measured meteorological parameters and PM10 concentrations were adopted as the model inputs to train the ANN model. A building-resolved CFD model under the same environmental settings was also set up to compare its model performance with the ANN model. Our results showed that the ANN model exhibited promising performance (r = 0.82, fractional bias = 0.002) when comparing the > 1000 h PM10 measurements. When comparing the diurnal hourly measured PM10 variations in a clear-sky day, both the ANN and CFD models performed well (r > 0.8). The good performance of the CFD model relied on the knowledge of the in situ diurnal traffic profile, the adoption of suitable mobile source emission factor(s) (e.g., from MOBILE 6 and COPERT4), and the use of urban thermal and dynamical variables to capture PM10 variations in both neutral and unstable atmospheric conditions. These requirements/constraints make it impractical for daily operation. On the contrary, the ML (ANN) model adopted here is free from these constraints and is fast (less than 0.1% computational time relative to the CFD model). These results demonstrate that the ANN model is a superior option for a smart city application. © 2023 by the authors.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,10.3390/ijerph20032412,0,0,Yes,,,,Hong Kong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These concerns include the challenges associated with an increase of harmful gases like carbon dioxide, the iterative/repetitive inhalation due to mask usage, and harsh environmental temperatures. Even in the presence of air quality sensing devices, these challenges can hinder the prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases, epidemics, and pandemics in severe cases. In this research, a dual time series with a bi-cluster sensor data-stream-based novel optimized regression algorithm was proposed with optimization predictors and responses that use an automated iterative optimization of the model based on the similarity coefficient index. The algorithm was implemented over SeReNoV2 sensor nodes data, i.e., a multi-variate dual time-series sensor, of the environmental and US Environmental Protection Agency standard, which measures variables for the air quality index using air quality sensors with geospatial profiling. The SeReNoV2 systems were placed at four locations that were 3 km apart to monitor the air quality and their data was collected at Ubidots IoT platform over GSM. The results have shown that the proposed technique achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.0042 with a training time of 469.28 s for the control and an RMSE of 1.646 in a training time of 28.53 s when optimized.

In this study, geospatial-artificial intelligence (Geo-AI) which combined kriging, land use regression (LUR), machine learning, an ensemble learning, was applied to develop ensemble mixed spatial models (EMSMs) for daily, daytime, and nighttime periods. These models were used to estimate the long-term O3 spatio-temporal variations using a two-decade worth of in-situ measurements, meteorological parameters, geospatial predictors, and social and season-dependent factors. From the traditional LUR approach, the performance of EMSMs improved by 60% (daytime), 49% (nighttime), and 57% (daily). The resulting daily, daytime, and nighttime EMSMs had a high explanatory power with and adjusted R2 of 0.91, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively.

In several types of pollution, Air pollution takes on a crucial role by directly affecting the respiratory system and causing fatal diseases in humans. Air pollution is a mixture of gaseous and particulate matter interweaved by different sources and emanating into the atmosphere. In particular, particle pollutants are critical in growing air pollution in India's main cities. Forecasting the particulate matter could mitigate the complications caused by it. The employment of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values is known as time series forecasting.

The aim was to simultaneously analyze both city-level air quality and regional- and global-scale radiative forcing values for anthropogenic aerosols. As the city-level air pollution values are typically underestimated in global-scale models, we used a machine learning approach to downscale fine particulate (PM2.5) concentrations towards measured values. We first simulated the global climate with the aerosol-climate model ECHAM-HAMMOZ and corrected the PM2.5 values for the Indian megacity New Delhi. The downscaling procedure clearly improved the seasonal variation in the model data. The seasonal trends were much better captured in the corrected PM2.5 than in original ECHAM-HAMMOZ PM2.5 when compared to the reference PM2.5 from the ground stations. However, short-term variations showed less extreme values with the downscaling approach. We applied the downscaling model also to simulations where the aerosol emissions were following two different future scenarios: one following the current legislation and one assuming currently maximum feasible emission reductions. The corrected PM2.5 concentrations for the year 2030 showed that mitigating anthropogenic aerosols improves local air quality in New Delhi, with organic carbon reductions contributing most to these improvements. In addition, aerosol emission mitigation also resulted in negative radiative forcing values over most of India. This was mainly due to reductions in absorbing black carbon emissions. For the two future emission scenarios modeled, the radiative forcing due to aerosol-radiation interactions over India was -0.09±0.26 and -0.53±0.31 W m-2, respectively, while the effective radiative forcing values were -2.1±4.6 and 0.06±3.39 W m-2, respectively. Although accompanied by relatively large uncertainties, the obtained results indicate that aerosol mitigation could bring a double benefit in India: better air quality and decreased warming of the local climate. Our results demonstrate that downscaling and bias correction allow more versatile utilization of global-scale climate models. With the help of downscaling, global climate models can be used in applications where one aims to analyze both global and regional effects of policies related to mitigating anthropogenic emissions. © 2023 Tuuli Miinalainen et al.",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,10.5194/acp-23-3471-2023,0,0,Yes,,,,"Finland,India",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For studies focused on within-city differences, this mischaracterization poses a risk of exposure misclassification, affecting epidemiological and environmental justice conclusions. Objective: Characterize the difference between intraurban pollution patterns predicted by national-scale land use regression modeling and observation-based estimates within a localized domain and examine the relationship between that difference and urban infrastructure and demographics. Methods: We compare highly resolved (0.01 km2) observations of NO2 mixing ratio and ultrafine particle (UFP) count obtained via mobile monitoring with national model predictions in thirteen neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area. Grid cell-level divergence between modeled and observed concentrations is termed “localized difference.” We use a flexible machine learning modeling technique, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, to investigate potentially nonlinear relationships between discrepancy between localized difference and known local emission sources as well as census block group racial/ethnic composition. Results: We find that observed local pollution extremes are not represented by land use regression predictions and that observed UFP count significantly exceeds regression predictions. Machine learning models show significant nonlinear relationships among localized differences between predictions and observations and the density of several types of pollution-related infrastructure (roadways, commercial and industrial operations). In addition, localized difference was greater in areas with higher population density and a lower share of white non-Hispanic residents, indicating that exposure misclassification by national models differs among subpopulations. Impact: Comparing national-scale pollution predictions with hyperlocal observations in the San Francisco Bay Area, we find greater discrepancies near major roadways and food service locations and systematic underestimation of concentrations in neighborhoods with a lower share of non-Hispanic white residents. These findings carry implications for using national-scale models in intraurban epidemiological and environmental justice applications and establish the potential utility of supplementing large-scale estimates with publicly available urban infrastructure and pollution source information. © 2023, The Author(s).",Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology,10.1038/s41370-023-00624-z,0,0,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) pollutants can cause serious damage to human health and property, so it is necessary to accurately predict the concentration of these pollutants. In this study, a hybrid deep air quality prediction model consisting of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long-term and short-term memory (BiLSTM), and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) is proposed to predict air quality pollutant concentrations. This model overcomes the limitations of a single model while taking advantages of its benefits. The BiLSTM neural network has more parameters and poor convergence performance, and the GRU has a poor ability to capture long-distance dependencies between features. Compared with the other three deep learning models, the CNN-BiLSTM-GRU model achieves better prediction results. The model proposed in this paper with both meteorological factors and pollutant factors shows the best prediction results with an R2 of 0.956 and RMSE of 17.2 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and an R2 of 0.958 and RMSE of 13.43 μg/m3 for O3. The original data set from the Aotizhongxin Observator of Beijing with 35,064 samples is selected as the experimental data. The experimental results show that the CNN-BiLSTM-GRU model proposed in this paper achieves the best prediction results.

Methods: In response to these challenges, we developed a personalized alert system based on individual lung function tests conducted in diverse environmental conditions, as determined by air-quality sensors. Our research was substantiated through an observational pilot study involving twelve healthy participants. These participants were exposed to varying air quality, temperature, and humidity conditions, and their lung function, as indicated by peak expiratory flow (PEF) values, was monitored. Results: The study revealed pronounced variability in pulmonary responses across different environments. Leveraging these findings, we proposed a design of a personalized alarm system that monitors air quality in real-time and issues alerts under potentially unfavorable environmental conditions. Additionally, we investigated the use of basic machine learning techniques to predict PEF values in these varied environmental settings. Discussion: The proposed system offers a proactive approach for individuals, particularly those with asthma, to actively manage their respiratory health. By providing real-time monitoring and personalized alerts, it aims to minimize exposure to potential asthma triggers. Ultimately, our system seeks to empower individuals with the tools for timely intervention, potentially reducing discomfort and enhancing management of asthma symptoms. © 2023 Alotaibi et al.",Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare,10.2147/jmdh.s435492,0,0,No,,,,"Saudi Arabia,United Arab Emirates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly gaining popularity due to their promise of better performance and comfort. Above all, they can help address the problem of urban air pollution. Nonetheless, lithium batteries, one of the most essential and expensive components of EVs, have posed challenges, such as battery aging, personal safety, and recycling. Precisely estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium battery packs can effectively assist in enhancing the personal safety of EVs and facilitating secondary trading and recycling in other industries without compromising safety and reliability. However, the RUL estimation of batteries involves many variables, and the operating conditions of EV batteries are highly dynamic as they change with the environment and the driving style of the users. Many existing methods exist to estimate the RUL based on batteries’ state of health (SOH), but only some are suitable for real-world data. There are several difficulties as follows. Firstly, obtaining data about battery usage in the real world takes work. Secondly, most of these estimation models must be more representative and generalized because they are trained on separate data for each battery. Lastly, collecting data for centralized training may lead to a breach of user privacy. In this article, we propose an RUL estimation method utilizing a deep learning (DL) approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and federated learning (FL) to predict the RUL of lithium batteries. We refrain from incorporating unmeasurable variables as inputs and instead develop an estimation model leveraging LSTM, capitalizing on its ability to predict time series data. In addition, we apply the FL framework to train the model to protect users’ battery data privacy. We verified the results of the model on experimental data. Meanwhile, we analyzed the model on actual data by comparing its mean absolute and relative errors. The comparison of the training and prediction results of the three sets of experiments shows that the federated training method achieves higher accuracy in predicting battery RUL compared to the centralized training method and another DL method, with solid training stability. © 2023 Chen et al.

This study develops a thermal and wet coupling calculation model of porous fabric to account for the migration of formaldehyde molecules in indoor air and cotton, silk, and polyester fabric with heat flux in Harbin, Beijing, Xi’an, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Kunming, China. The time-by-time indoor dry-bulb temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and Cf, obtained from verified simulations, were collated and used as input data for the long short-term memory (LSTM) of the deep learning model that predicts indoor multivariate time series Cf from the secondary source effects of indoor fabrics (adsorption and release of formaldehyde). The trained LSTM model can be used to predict multivariate time series Cf at other emission times and locations. The LSTM-based model also predicted Cf with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) that fell within 10%, 10%, 0.5, 0.5, and 0.8, respectively. In addition, the characteristics of the input dataset, model parameters, the prediction accuracy of different indoor fabrics, and the uncertainty of the data set are analyzed. The results show that the prediction accuracy of single data set input is higher than that of temperature and humidity input, and the prediction accuracy of LSTM is better than recurrent neural network (RNN). The method’s feasibility was established, and the study provides theoretical support for guiding indoor air pollution control measures and ensuring human health and safety.

We present a study using several machine-learning methods to forecast NO2 concentration using historical pollution data and meteorological variables and apply them to the city of Erfurt, Germany. We propose modelling the time dependency using embedding variables, which enable the model to learn the implicit behaviour of traffic and offers the possibility to elaborate on local events. In addition, the model uses seven meteorological features to forecast the NO2 concentration for the next hours. The forecasting model also uses the seasonality of the pollution levels. Our experimental study shows that promising forecasts can be achieved, especially for holidays and similar occasions which lead to shifts in usual seasonality patterns. While the MAE values of the compared models range from (Formula presented.) to 15, our model achieves values of (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) and thus outperforms the others in almost every instance.

The current tools can give updates on the Air Quality Index (AQI), but we can get further insights into air pollution by applying knowledge discovery and analytics techniques. Our research proposes a novel and integrated framework to predict AQI using pollutant concentration data and meteorological data. The framework comprises four modules for insights into air pollution. The first module (AQIfp) computes air quality by forecasting pollutant concentrations of particulate matter and harmful gases. The second module (AQIp) predicts air quality using pollutant data and historical air quality index data. The third module (AQIm) predicts AQI using meteorological features (temperature, surface pressure, cloud cover, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation) and extra features (month, year, time, day of month, day of week). The fourth module (AQIc) computes AQI by combining the results of AQIp and AQIm. Various methods are used for forecasting pollutants and predicting AQI, viz artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest regression, XGradientboost, long-short term memory, vector autoregression, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), decision tree regression, support vector regression, multiple linear regression, and K-nearest neighbour. The results show that different methods are best suited for various pollutants. However, ARIMA and ANN successfully predict almost all the pollutants. The results are promising, with Mean Absolute Error to predict AQI being 7.09 only when combining AQIp and AQIm. AQI can be predicted best with both pollutant and meteorological data. Since the modules are independent and if one data is missing, any module can be utilized to obtain an approximation of the AQI with minimal error. The framework will assist in providing decisions at the individual and administration levels to mitigate air pollution. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Multimedia Tools and Applications,10.1007/s11042-023-17432-0,0,0,Yes,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the field of PM2.5 pollution forecasting, a series of results have emerged so far. However, in the existing research field of PM2.5 prediction, most studies tend to predict short-term temporal series. Existing studies tend to ignore the temporal and spatial characteristics of PM2.5 transport, which leads to its poor performance in long-term prediction. In this paper, by optimizing previous PM2.5 deep learning prediction models, we propose a model GAT-EGRU. First, we add a spatial modular Graph Attention Network (GAT) and couple an Empirical Modal Decomposition algorithm (EMD), considering the temporal and spatial properties of PM2.5. Then, we use Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to filter spatio-temporal features for iterative rolling PM2.5 prediction. The experimental results show that the GAT-EGRU model has more advantages in predicting PM2.5 concentrations, especially for long time steps. This proves that the GAT-EGRU model outperforms other models for PM2.5 forecasting. After that, we verify the effectiveness of each module by distillation experiments. The experimental results show that each model module has an essential role in the final PM2.5 prediction results.

Accurate air quality prediction data allows government officials and the public to take preventive measures in advance. Recently, many air quality prediction studies have used machine learning techniques to identify patterns and rules in air quality data. However, these studies generally adopted under-represented background levels, and the prediction intervals were often in hours, which may not be suitable for residents who needed accurate air quality forecasts. Therefore, this study proposes a deep learning-based multi-timestamp multi-location PM2.5 prediction system built on two types of recurrent neural network models: long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Airbox data for the Taipei metropolitan area serves as the main source of training data to develop a forecasting model that can predict changes of PM2.5 levels within the next six to thirty minutes in different locations. The prediction results are verified by comparing them with the PM2.5 measuring results from an internet of things (IoT)-based on-vehicle monitoring system, which enables real-time data sensing and collection, and wireless transmission.

Aiming at solving the drawback of low accuracy of PM2.5 concentration prediction, this paper proposes a method based on deep learning to predict PM2.5 concentration. Firstly, we comprehensively consider various meteorological elements such as temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind, visibility, etc., and comprehensively analyze the correlation between meteorological elements and PM2.5 concentration. Secondly, the time series data of PM2.5 concentration monitoring stations are used as the reference sequence and comparison sequence in the gray correlation analysis algorithm to construct the spatial weight matrix, and the spatial relationship of the original data is extracted by using the spatial weight matrix. Finally, we combine the forgetting and input threshold to synthesize the updated threshold, merge the unit state and the hidden state, and use the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) as the core network structure of the recurrent neural network. Compared with the traditional LSTM model, the GRU model is simpler. In terms of convergence time and required epoch, GRU is better than the traditional LSTM model. On the basis of ensuring the accuracy of the model, the training time of the model is further reduced. The experimental results show that the root mean square error and the average absolute error of this method can reach 18.32 (Formula presented.) and 13.54 (Formula presented.) in the range of 0–80 h, respectively.

As a result, it's critical to monitor pollution levels and notify the public on the state of the air. An indicator called the Air Quality Index (AQI) does this by mapping the concentration of different contaminants into a single number. Because the examination of pollutant data is frequently opaque to outsiders, poor environmental control judgments may result. This has led to a need for a tamper-proof pollution management system for use by authorities, like the state and central pollution boards. To address these challenges, a model using machine learning algorithms to predict the air quality and store that information in the blockchain is proposed. Machine learning algorithms are used to categorize the air quality, and blockchain technology guarantees a permanent, tamper-proof record of all air quality data. Such a system might address the persistent issues with data dependability, immutability and trust in pollution control. The execution time of two main operations on blockchain are measured.

Each monitoring site's predicted output is transferred as input to the geostatistical Ordinary Kriging interpolation layer to generate the entire region's spatial-temporal interpolation prediction map. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in regional control of air pollution. © 2023 K. K. R. Samal et al., licensed to EAI.

Unfortunately, personal air quality measurement remains challenging. In this study, we investigate the use of first-person photos for the prediction of air quality. The main idea is to harness the power of a generalized stacking approach and the importance of haze features extracted from first-person images to create an efficient new stacking model called AirStackNet for air pollution prediction. AirStackNet consists of two layers and four regression models, where the first layer generates meta-data from Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBoost) and CatBoost Regression (CatBoost), whereas the second layer computes the final prediction from the meta-data of the first layer using Extra Tree Regression (ET). The performance of the proposed AirStackNet model is validated using public Personal Air Quality Dataset (PAQD). Our experiments are evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R2), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G connectivity enables numerous smart system technologies. One of the most critical aspects of smart cities is Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) which allow for accurate traffic forecasting. Existing traffic forecasting approaches use simple models based on univariate historical datasets or fuse historical traffic data with other datasets, such as air pollution records. These techniques interpreted traffic data points as independent samples despite their time dependency, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose an enhanced traffic prediction approach using the sliding window technique. The proposed approach transforms the traffic data points into time-series sequence data using the sliding window technique. Moreover, the proposed approach exploits traffic and pollution datasets for multivariate traffic prediction. The proposed approach compares different machine/deep learning techniques for prediction and evaluates their accuracy compared to a baseline benchmark. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the evaluation metrics values for the tested machine and deep learning techniques by an average value of 36% and 24%, respectively, compared to the base-line benchmark. © (2023), (Universitatea ""Stefan cel Mare"" din Suceava).

This has drastic effect on air quality making it better because of control of vehicle emissions. This study analyzed the air quality in Chennai city using the parameters of pollution (NH3, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3 and CO) for air quality data for monitoring stations (three) spread over the city. National Air Quality Index (NAQI) has been used to present the quality of air spatially during lockdown and before lockdown. The concentrations of PM2.5 among the pollutants selected showed a maximum reduction (-61%) compared to the pre-lockdown process. NO2 (−40%) and CO (−32%) have also gone down when lockdown was in place, among other contaminants. In the different sections of the city, about 53% reduction in NAQI has been observed. Deep learning short-term predictions of various air pollutants are made in this study. The correlation between AQI and Pollutants (NH3, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3 and CO) in the study area modelled in deep learning using PYTHON. The classification of AQI class has been created in python with AQI values of Good (0-50), Satisfactory (51-100), Moderate (101-200), Poor (201-300), Very poor (301-400) and severe (>401). The study shows the level of co-relation of PM2.5 being the highest. A linear regression model was performed and metrics such mean absolute error, r2 to check the model performance for training and testing data are calculated. These results can be coupled with social, economic and Cultural factors that could have common emission patterns and air quality especially in metropolitan cities. The present study would aid authorities as it clearly shows that the quality can be made better if sources of emission can be diminished.

However, the limited spatial coverage of regulatory monitors and the lack of consideration of mobility limit the ability to capture actual air pollution exposure. Methods: This study aims to improve traditional exposure assessment methods for PM2.5 by incorporating the measurements from a low-cost sensor network (PurpleAir) and regulatory monitors, an automated machine learning modeling framework, and big human mobility data. We develop a monthly-aggregated hourly land use regression (LUR) model based on automated machine learning (AutoML) and assess the model performance across eight metropolitan areas within the US. Results: Our results show that integrating low-cost sensor with regulatory monitor measurements generally improves the AutoML-LUR model accuracy and produces higher spatial variation in PM2.5 concentration maps compared to using regulatory monitor measurements alone. Feature importance analysis shows factors highly correlated with PM2.5 concentrations, including satellite aerosol optical depth, meteorological variables, vegetation, and land use. In addition, we incorporate human mobility data on exposure estimates regarding where people visit to identify spatiotemporal hotspots of places with higher risks of exposure, emphasizing the need to consider both visitor numbers and PM2.5 concentrations when developing exposure reduction strategies. Discussion: This research provides important insights for further public health studies on air pollution by comprehensively assessing the performance of AutoML-LUR models and incorporating human mobility into considering human exposure to air pollution.

For the first time, the present study uses multiple linear regression (MLR) and a random forest (RF) algorithm to predict PM2.5 concentrations in Astana, Kazakhstan during heating and non-heating periods (predictive variables: air pollutant concentrations, meteorological parameters). Estimated PM2.5 was then used for Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) risk assessment. The RF model showed higher accuracy than the MLR model (R2 from 0.79 to 0.98 in RF). MLR yielded more conservative predictions, making it more suitable for use with a lower number of predictor variables. PM10 and carbon monoxide concentrations contributed most to the PM2.5 prediction (both models), whereas meteorological parameters showed lower association. Estimated DALY for Astana’s population (2019) ranged from 2160 to 7531 years. The developed methodology is applicable to locations with comparable air pollution and climate characteristics.

The main goal of this paper is to predict air quality index (AQI) spatio-temporal data. The observations of spatio-temporal big datasets like AQI data are correlated both spatially and temporally, and computation of the prediction or forecasting with dependence structure is often infeasible. As such, the likelihood function based on the spatio-temporal model may be complicated and some special modelings are useful for statistically reliable predictions.

Next, neural networks model, a deep learning method based on artificial neural networks, is applied. Finally, random forest model, a machine learning method that is closer to computational science, will be introduced.

To address these challenges, researchers have proposed various machine learning models for predicting travel time and road impedance function. In this paper, a hybrid particle swarm optimization—radial basis function neural network model is proposed for improving the accuracy of the road impedance function. The model takes into consideration various vehicle types and is validated using travel time data collected from a road section in Huai’an City, China.

Especially, PM2.5 cannot be blocked by filtration system of respiratory tract to cause serious threat to public health. Considering the serious impact of air pollution on human health and life, air pollutant concentration forecast has been drawn great attention because it can provide people with information of air quality. In order to improve the accuracy of air pollutant concentration forecast, this study proposes a new Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) multi-step forecasting model is proposed. Initially, input data are decomposed by enhanced empirical wavelet transform (EEWT) to increase the dimensionality of the data. Next, EEWT-NLSTM, EEWT-DLSTM and EEWT-Bi-LSTM models are constructed using wavelet decomposition results and Nested Long short-term memory neural network (NLSTM), Deep Long short-term memory neural network (DLSTM), and Bi-directional long-short term memory neural network (Bi-LSTM), respectively, followed by comparison and contrast of the prediction results. Three single prediction models are incorporated into combined weighted forecasting model by weight assignment, it improves the prediction accuracy. To accurately assess effectiveness of the experimental model, three evaluation metrics, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), are used in this paper to quantitatively evaluate prediction performance of proposed model. For the prediction of PM2.5, the proposed model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.047428. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Multimedia Tools and Applications,10.1007/s11042-023-16167-2,0,0,Yes,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to this development trend, fuel cell systems gradually become a potential alternative to traditional power systems for high efficiency, high energy density and zero pollution, while the relatively short life time has tremendously limited its large-scale commercial application. To extend the fuel cell lifespan, degradation predictive methods are proved to have outstanding effect. In this article, a hybrid prediction model based on deep temporal feature extraction and transfer learning is proposed. Firstly, the health index is constructed by extracting the fuel cell degradation features through a temporal convolutional network; on this basis, transfer learning is performed according to the feature extraction, and finally the extracted features are input into the long short-term memory model to complete the fuel cell degradation prediction. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified with experimentally extracting degradation data under different operating conditions, and the results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the prediction accuracy and decrease the computation by extracting key parameters of fuel cell degradation and is independent of operating conditions.

The absence of independent replication makes prediction ambiguous as a concept and renders evaluation procedures developed for independent data inappropriate for most space–time prediction problems. Motivated by air pollution data collected during California wildfires in 2008, this manuscript attempts a formalization of the true prediction error associated with spatial interpolation. We investigate a variety of cross-validation (CV) procedures employing both simulations and case studies to provide insight into the nature of the estimand targeted by alternative data partition strategies. Consistent with recent best practice, we find that location-based cross-validation is appropriate for estimating spatial interpolation error as in our analysis of the California wildfire data.

Here, we propose a long short-term memory Bayesian neural network (LSTM-BNN) to improve performance of the predictive profiles via quantifying uncertainties and adjusting model parameters. For this, we develop a new inferring technique for kernel density estimation with subdivision tuning to ensure both forecast accuracy and computational efficiency with a limited number of samples from the prediction distributions. Moreover, a novel algorithm called spatially-adjusted multivariate imputation by chained equation is also developed to take into account spatial correlations between nearby air-quality stations for correctly imputing the incoming data, and hence, to enable forecasting at a local scale. The LSTM-BNN framework is evaluated with observed datasets collected from stations and modeling outputs generated by the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model - Chemical Transport Model (CCAM-CTM) currently used in NSW. The airborne pollutants under investigation are PM2.5 and ozone, which frequently exceed the standards. The results obtained from data fusion with our framework demonstrated high performance of the proposed LSTM-BNN model in air-pollutant prediction with reductions of over 30% in root mean square error compared to CCAM-CTM and over 50 % in inferring time compared to a DL model with Gaussian-based inference.

Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) is released into the atmosphere by stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana and forest fires in the north-eastern and central areas of the country. Accurate short-term PM 2.5 estimates are essential to protect human health and reduce acute air pollution. However, global air quality forecasting methods grapple with a persistent assumption of fire emissions. They use near-real-time fire emissions throughout the prediction cycle. Air quality forecasts are prone to inaccuracies and biases due to fire emissions’ dynamic nature. We employ spatiotemporal deep learning techniques, specifically ConvLSTM and ConvGRU, to forecast fire emission locations up to three days in advance. Through our evaluation, we find that ConvLSTM outperforms ConvGRU in terms of prediction accuracy and performance. The chosen model provides a very good correlation coefficient (≈ 0.8) for the 1st day forecast and a moderate value (0.5 - 0.55) for subsequent 2nd and 3rd days forecasts. The predictors NDVI, temperature, wind, surface pressure, and total cloud cover are included to our model training to improve these correlations. In Punjab-Haryana, wind input improves results. This fire burning location prediction method could improve air quality forecasting. Our deep learning model can improve forecasts by revealing the complex interactions of components and reflecting fire emissions’ dynamic nature. This research may help improve air quality forecasts in the face of rising fire events, protecting communities across the Indian subcontinent. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Modeling Earth Systems and Environment,10.1007/s40808-023-01831-1,0,0,Yes,,,,"India,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dispersion and accumulation of PM2.5 are affected by meteorological elements near the ground and in the upper air. Nevertheless, the current PM2.5 inversion models based on the deep neural network only consider ground elements. To further optimize the model and improve the inversion accuracy, a PM2.5 hourly inversion model integrating upper-air meteorological data was proposed, and a parametric rectified linear unit was used as the activation function of the model. The results showed that among the input elements, PM2.5 had the highest correlation with AOD, with a correlation coefficient of 0.33. The proposed model achieved the highest accuracy on the test set, with RMSE, MAE, and R2 of 14.39 μg/m3, 9.67μg/m3, and 0.83, respectively.

High concentrations of PM2.5 show its impact on human health, the environment, and climate change. An accurate prediction of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is significant to air pollution detection, environmental management, human health, and social development. The primary approach is to boost the forecast performance by reducing the error in the deep learning model. So, there is a need to propose an enhanced loss function (ELF) to decrease the error and improve the accurate prediction of daily PM2.5 concentrations.

Because of the poor quality of air substances, air pollution occurs. Living beings and other economic resources get affected by this polluted air very frequently. Therefore, air quality prediction is a trendsetting method to maintain a healthy life and infrastructure. Though multiple existing models are implemented, managing high-level data and deploying such standard models become cumbersome. Rather than indoor air quality, the ambient (outdoor) air quality should require the prediction process as it exists in the open environment. Thus, an intelligent ambient air quality prediction model is needed, which is designed in this paper by adopting a heuristic-aided deep learning model. The original air data is initially fetched from the three diverse data sources. It is followed by the data pre-processing stage with standard techniques. Subsequently, the resultant data is given to Adaptive Serial Cascaded Autoencoder and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Multivariate Regression (ASCA-LSMR), in which some of the hyper-parameters are tuned by proposing the novel algorithm as Fitness-based Improved Flow Direction Algorithm (FIFDA) to produce the better prediction results. Finally, experimental results indicate that our method enables more accurate predictions than all the listed traditional models and performs better in predictive performance. The RMSE of the designed FIFDA-ASCA-LSMR method attains 31.9%, 33.5%, 6.66%, and 23.7% elevated than SSA-ASCA-LSMR, DHOA-ASCA-LSMR, EHO-ASCA-LSMR, and FDA-ASCA-LSMR, for dataset 2.

The underestimation of a pollutant concentration that coincides with fire would indicate its impact on air quality. Over 1353 thousand cases of fires in Poland and data from 410 air quality stations were analyzed (from 2012–2021). Models for prediction of NO2, NOx, PM10, SO2, and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, and o-xylene) concentrations were built for the carefully selected station (rural background; Borówiec). The accuracy of models was checked as a function of distance from the fire and validated with the dispersion of plumes emitted during big landfill fires in 2018. The share of underpredicted concentrations of PM10, benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene on days when fire appeared in a range 30 km from the air quality station was significantly higher than the model performance. The concentrations of PM10, SO2, and BTEX, during plumes from landfill fires, were underestimated at least 30% of the duration of exposure. Hence, it was shown that it is very likely fires' contribution to air pollution can be evaluated using machine learning model misclassification. © 2022, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

Feature selection removes the irrelevant features, which improves both the accuracy and prediction performance. The significant advantages of reducing the number of features from the dataset are reducing the training time, reducing overfitting, decreasing the curse of dimensionality, and simplifying the prediction model. The filter feature selection techniques can handle the issues with the high number of features, and this paper uses the symmetric uncertainty coefficient to verify the relevance of the independent features.

Kurtosis-based feature selection is compared with seven filter feature selection techniques on air pollution dataset and validated the performance of the proposed algorithm. It has been observed that the kurtosis-based feature selection extracts only PM2.5 as the key feature and has been compared to the accuracy of the five existing methods.

Despite these critical applications, robust estimation of high spatiotemporal resolution NMVOCs concentrations remains a challenge. In this study, we develop a space-time Light Gradient Boosting Machine (STLGB) model, which successfully renders hourly maps of NMVOCs concentrations across Shanghai from 2019 to 2022 by integrating spatiotemporal information. After extensive training, the STLGB model demonstrates remarkable estimation performance for NMVOCs, accounting for multiple spatiotemporal variables (R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 34.52 ppb). With the developed model, we provide first high-resolution (1 km) hourly NMVOCs concentration maps, uncovering previously overlooked spatiotemporal variations. Further, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) regression values reveal significant local interpretation capabilities of the STLGB model, emphasizing the strong influence of emissions on NMVOCs estimation, whilst acknowledging the important contribution of space and time term. Our study of the pandemic lockdown further showcases the model's adaptability to unique events influenced by policy changes. The superior performance of the STLGB model, with its minimal computational memory requirements and faster speed, makes it an ideal tool for air pollutant estimation, adaptable to any region with NMVOCs monitoring capabilities. Non-methane Volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are significant air pollutants that have severe effects on health and the environment. Despite the availability of VOCs monitoring stations that can provide data with good temporal resolution, the low spatial resolution of these stations remains a challenge. Accurate estimation of NMVOCs concentrations requires new methods to address these spatial resolution issues. In recent years, machine learning-based models have emerged as a promising alternative for air pollution estimations. However, research on high-resolution mapping of NMVOCs concentrations using machine learning models is limited. This study provides the first predicted spatial distribution of hourly NMVOCs map deduced from sparse observations using the machine learning models.

Previous studies of air pollution and images have used static images (e.g., satellite images or Google Street View images). The current study was designed to develop deep learning methodologies to infer on-road pollutant concentrations from videos acquired with dashboard cameras. Fifty hours of on-road measurements of four pollutants (black carbon, particle number concentration, PM2.5 mass concentration, carbon dioxide) in Bengaluru, India, were analyzed. The analysis of each video frame involved identifying objects and determining motion (by segmentation and optical flow). Based on these visual cues, a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to deduce pollution concentrations. The findings showed that the CNN approach outperformed several other machine learning (ML) techniques and more conventional analyses (e.g., linear regression). The CO2 prediction model achieved a normalized root-mean-square error of 10-13.7% for the different train-validation division methods. The results here thus contribute to the literature by using video and the relative motion of on-screen objects rather than static images and by implementing a rapid-analysis approach enabling analysis of the video in real time. These methods can be applied to other mobile-monitoring campaigns since the only additional equipment they require is an inexpensive dashboard camera.",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,10.1021/acs.est.3c04495,0,0,Yes,,,,"United States,India,England,Israel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most of the existing time-series-based deep-learning models use offline spatial interpolation strategies and thus cannot reliably project the station-based forecast to the spatial region of interest. In this study, the station-based long short-term memory (LSTM) technique was extended for spatial air quality forecasting by combining a novel deep-learning layer, termed the broadcasting layer, which incorporates a learnable weight decay parameter designed for point-to-area extension. Unlike most existing deep-learning-based methods that isolate the interpolation from the model training process, the proposed end-to-end LSTM broadcasting framework can consider the temporal characteristics of the time series and spatial relationships among different stations. To validate the proposed deep-learning framework, PM2.5 and O3 forecasts for the next 48 h were obtained using 3D chemical transport model simulation results and ground observation data as the inputs. The root mean square error associated with the proposed framework was 40 % and 20 % lower than those of the Weather Research and Forecasting-Community Multiscale Air Quality model and an offline combination of the deep-learning and spatial interpolation methods, respectively.

This study tries to determine the contribution of spatial pattern of brickfields on air pollution in the Dhaka metropolitan area. Concentrations of CO, NO2, and SO2 emissions are analysed to determine the distribution of air pollution contributed by brickfields in the area. To detect the spatial pattern of the brickfields in the area, a deep learning-based single shot detector (SSD) object detection model was used to locate brickfields in the study area using high-resolution optical satellite imagery. The model accuracy was calculated to be 90%. The application of ordination techniques to determine the dominant factors causing air pollution was explored. Both unconstrained and constrained ordination techniques were used to determine the influence of brick fields on air pollution. Principal component analysis (unconstrained ordination) was used to analyse the independent variables (factors influencing pollution in the region). The unconstrained analysis showed that meteorological variables such as relative humidity and atmospheric pressure explained the distribution of air pollution better. However, redundancy analysis determined that the proximity of brickfields to nearby roads had the highest influence on the spatial pattern of air pollution. This indicates that brickfields closer to road networks have a higher contribution to air pollution. This study presents a new workflow using ordination techniques to model the impact of brickfields on air pollution based on freely available satellite imagery. This is vital for developing monitoring systems for assessing the impact of the spatial distribution of brickfields on air pollution in and around a megacity.

Machine learning was utilised to eliminate weather-related fluctuations in air pollutant concentrations, and two difference-in-difference models were employed to estimate the effects of general epidemic prevention and enhancement measures on air pollution and evaluate the total impact of city lockdown on air pollutant concentrations. By carefully examining the proportion of these effects in the overall impact, this study analysed the cost-effectiveness of city-level lockdown measures on air pollution. Results indicate that city lockdowns significantly reduced the concentrations of five air pollutants: NO2 (-28.3 %), PM10 (-21.41 %), PM2.5 (-15.83 %), CO (-8.66 %), and SO2 (-4.2 %). The contributions of the enhancement measures are 41.82 % for PM2.5, 42.66 % for PM10, -4.04 % for CO, and 31.83 % for NO2.

This nationwide study in Sweden aims to investigate if air pollution is associated with a higher risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in an area with relatively low air pollution levels.Methods and Results This study was a nationwide time-stratified case-crossover study investigating the association between short-term air pollution exposures and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using data from the SRCR (Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) between 2009 and 2019. Daily air pollution levels were estimated in 1x1-km grids for all of Sweden using a satellite-based machine learning model. The association between daily air pollutant levels and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was quantified using conditional logistic regression adjusted for daily air temperature. Particulate matter <2.5 mu m exposure was associated with a higher risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest among a total of 29 604 cases. In a multipollutant model, the association was most pronounced for intermediate daily lags, with an increased relative risk of 6.2% (95% CI, 1.0-11.8) per 10 mu g/m(3) increase of particulate matter <2.5 mu m 4 days before the event. A similar pattern of association was observed for particulate matter <10 mu m. No clear association was observed for O-3 and NO2.Conclusions Short-term exposure to air pollution was associated with higher risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

First, the intelligent clustering and recognition methods of traffic flow patterns are constructed based on neural network and deep-learning algorithms. Then, multifactor MFD models are developed considering different road types, traffic flow patterns and weekday peak hours. Finally, the high spatiotemporal resolution estimation method of whole sample traffic volumes and emissions are constructed based on MFD models. The results show that traffic flow patterns are clustered efficiently by the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) algorithm combined with the direct time-varying speed index, which describe 91.7% traffic flow states of urban roads.

However, there is a need for a low-cost, automated solution for fast detection of polluting vehicles from the end of law enforcers. In this article, we have presented a novel deep learning based evaluation strategy that will identify the pollutant vehicle through on-road installed surveillance camera images. An enhanced image data set with notable variations has been prepared for training the models. Thereafter, a multi-model feedback process has been integrated. In contrast to the other deep learning approaches, the proposed framework has started with low labeled training data which is quite relevant in real-life scenarios. Subsequently, the size of the training samples has been increased using feedback.

Nevertheless, the frequent occurrence of missing sensor data due to problems of mobile transmission, frontend/backend device malfunction, or other unforeseen issues would raise difficulty in making quick responses to air pollution incidents. This study proposed a hybrid deep learning model (AE-CNN-BP) collaborating an Autoencoder (AE), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) to effectively extract crucial features from big data for making successive high-spatiotemporal-resolution forecasts of PM2.5 concentrations 4 h ahead. The proposed model was trained and tested in three industrial zones densely installed with microsensors in Kaohsiung City of Taiwan.

In this paper, the performance of machine learning models on predicting PM2.5 is assessed with linear regression (LR), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting regression (GBR), AdaBoost regression (ABR), XGBoost (XGB), k-nearest neighbors (K-NN), long short-term memory (LSTM), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) using PM2.5 station data from 2017 to 2021. To compare the accuracy of all the nine machine learning models, the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root mean square error ratio (RSR), and percent bias (PBIAS) were evaluated. Among all nine models, the RF (100 decision trees with a max depth of 20) and support vector regression (SVR; nonlinear kernel, degree 3 polynomial) models were the best for predicting PM2.5 concentrations. Additionally, comparison of the PM2.5 performance metrics displayed that the models had better predictive behavior in the western United States than that in the eastern United States.",EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE,10.1029/2023ea002911,0,0,Yes,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, understanding how the combined exposure to heat and air pollution affects both physical and mental health remains insufficient due to the complexity of such effects mingling with human society, urban and natural environments. Our study roots in the Social Ecological Theory and employs a tri-environmental conceptual framework (i.e., across social, built and natural environment) to examine how the combined exposure to heat and air pollution affect self-reported physical and mental health via, for the first time, the fine-grained nationwide investigation in Australia and highlight how such effects vary across inter- and intra-urban areas. We conducted an ecological study to explore the importance of heat and air quality to physical and mental health by considering 48 tri-environmental confounders through the global and local random forest regression models, as advanced machine learning methods with the advantage of revealing the spatial heterogeneity of variables. Our key findings are threefold. First, the social and built environmental factors are important to physical and mental health in both urban and rural areas, and even more important than exposure to heat and air pollution. Second, the relationship between temperature and air quality and health follows a V-shape, reflecting people's different adaptation and tolerance to temperature and air quality. Third, the important roles that heat and air pollution play in physical and mental health are most obvious in the inner-city and near inner-city areas of the major capital cities, as well as in the industrial zones in peri-urban regions and in Darwin city with a low-latitude. We draw several policy implications to minimise the inter- and intra-urban differences in healthcare access and service distribution to populations with different sensitivity to heat and air quality across urban and rural areas.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques play a crucial role in classifying patterns derived from sensor data. Environmental stations offer a multitude of parameters that can be obtained to uncover hidden patterns showcasing the impact of pollution on the surrounding environment. This paper focuses on utilizing the CO parameter as an indicator of pollution in two datasets collected from wireless environmental monitoring devices in the greater Port area and the Town Hall of Igoumenitsa City in Greece. The datasets are normalized to facilitate their utilization in classification algorithms. The k-means algorithm is applied, and the elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters. Subsequently, the datasets are introduced to the grammatical evolution algorithm to calculate the percentage fault. This method constructs classification programs in a human-readable format, making it suitable for analysis. Finally, the proposed method is compared against four state-of-the-art models: the Adam optimizer for optimizing artificial neural network parameters, a genetic algorithm for training an artificial neural network, the Bayes model, and the limited-memory BFGS method applied to a neural network.

Land use regression (LUR) models are widely used to estimate ground-level NO2 concentrations by describing the satellite land use characteristics of a given location using buffer distance averages of variables. However, information may be leaked in this approach as averages ignore the variances within the averaged region. Therefore, in this study, we leverage a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to directly pass data grids of various satellite data for the prediction of U.S. national ground-level NO2. We designed CNN architectures of various complexity which inputs both satellite and meteorological reanalysis data, testing both high and low resolution data grids. Our resulting model accurately predicted NO2 concentrations at both daily (R-2 = 0.892, RMSE = 2.259, MAE = 1.534) and annual (R-2 = 0.952, RMSE = 0.988, MAE = 0.690) temporal scales, with coarse resolution imagery and simple CNN architectures displaying the best and most efficient performance. Furthermore, the CNN outperforms traditional buffer distance models, including random forest (RF), feedforward neural network (FNN), and multivariate linear regression (MLR) approaches, resulting in the MLR performing the poorest at daily (R-2 = 0.625, RMSE = 4.281, MAE = 3.102) and annual (R-2 = 0.758, RMSE = 2.218, MAE = 1.652) scales.

Daily atmospheric measurements were captured for six major pollutants: PM10, PM2.5, O-3, NO2, CO, and SO2. We employed traditional correlation analyses alongside machine learning models, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM), to dissect the effects of these pollutants and the potential time lag in their symptom manifestation. Our analyses revealed that CO showed the strongest positive correlation with hospital visits across all three categories, with a notable significance in the 4-day lag analysis. NO(2 )also exhibited a substantial positive association, particularly with outpatient visits and hospital admissions and especially in the 4-day lag analysis.

The proposed models predict the hourly air pollutant concentration based on 4-h historical input based on six air pollutant data, meteorology parameters, and PM2.5 concentration data from the neighboring air quality monitoring stations. Long short-term memory based on metaheuristic algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization and sparrow search algorithm (PSO-LSTM and SSA-LSTM), are first developed and applied to determine the significance input combination to the changes of PM2.5 concentration at respective target stations. Then, the input configuration that gives the best forecasting accuracy was selected for subsequent experiments using enhanced approaches based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMDPSO-LSTM and EEMD-SSA-LSTM).

Indeed, these changes comprise a broad spectrum of activities that can often lead to significant environmental impacts such as surface damage, air pollution, soil erosion, and ecosystem degradation. Conventional optical sensors face limitations due to cloud cover, hindering accurate observation of the mining area. To overcome this challenge, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have emerged as a powerful solution, due to their unique ability to penetrate clouds and provide a clear view of the ground. The open-pit mine change detection task presents significant challenges, justifying the need for a model trained for this specific task. First, different mining areas frequently include various features, resulting in a diverse range of land cover types within a single scene. This heterogeneity complicates the detection and distinction of changes within open-pit mines. Second, pseudo changes, e.g., equipment movements or humidity fluctuations, which show statistically reliable reflectivity changes, lead to false positives, as they do not directly correspond to the actual changes of interest, i.e., blasting, collapsing, or waste pile operations. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first deep learning model in the literature that can accurately detect changes within open-pit mines using SAR images (TerraSAR-X). We showcase the fundamental role of data augmentations and a coherence layer as a critical component in enhancing the model's performance, which initially relied solely on amplitude information. In addition, we demonstrate how, in the presence of a few labels, a pseudo-labeling pipeline can improve the model robustness, without degrading the performance by introducing misclassification points related to pseudo changes.

We sought to (1) quantify associations of air pollution, specifically particulate matter <2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5), with CST IV and (2) explore the extent to which racial disparities in PM2.5 exposure might explain racial differences in the prevalence of CST IV. Design: Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of 566 participants of the Motherhood & Microbiome study. PM2.5 exposures were derived from a machine learning model integrating NASA satellite and EPA ground monitor data. Previously, cervicovaginal swabs from 15 to 20 weeks' gestation were analyzed using 16 S rRNA sequencing and hierarchical clustering assigned CSTs. Multivariable logistic regression models calculated adjusted odds ratios of CST IV (vs. other CSTs) per interquartile range (IQR) increment of PM2.5. Race-stratified and mediation analyses were performed. Results: Higher PM2.5 exposure was associated with CST IV (aOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.02-1.91). Further adjustment for race/ethnicity attenuated the association (aOR 1.34, 95% CI: 0.97-1.83). Black participants (vs. White) had higher median PM2.5 exposure (10.6 vs. 9.6 mu g/m(3,) P < 0.001) and higher prevalence of CST IV (47% vs. 11%, P < 0.001). Mediation analysis revealed that higher PM2.5 exposure may explain 3.9% (P = 0.038) and 3.3% (P = 0.15) of the Black-White disparity in CST IV in unadjusted and adjusted models, respectively. Conclusion: PM2.5 was associated with CST IV, a risk factor for sPTB. Additionally, PM2.5 exposure may partially explain racial differences in the prevalence of CST IV. Further research is warranted to discover how environmental exposures affect microbial composition and perpetuate racial health disparities.",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,10.1016/j.envres.2023.116492,0,0,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, factors such as temperature, pressure, and surface area can influence its performance in adsorbingcarbon dioxide. To maximize CO2 adsorption, it is vital to determine the relationships among these variables. In this paper, we use several preprocessing techniques and various machine learning algorithms, such as Gradient Boosting Regressor, Convolutional Neural Networks, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory, to explore the efficacy of these algorithms in predicting CO2 capture capacities. We augment our datasets by generating new features and in turn our ML models achieve a better performance on the augmented datasets compared to the original dataset. Our models achieved r2 score of 90.7 % on the training set and 85.73 % on the test set of the augmented datasets. Furthermore, we were able to determine that the ratio of carbon to pressure as well as temperature, and aspects tied to the physical conditions of the adsorbent material emerge as the most influential factors in CO2 adsorption.

Understanding the main pollution sources of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon dioxide (CO2), and the drivers that accelerate their concentrations can provide novel insights into the co-benefits of air-quality improvement and climate change mitigation. Hence, in this study, we conducted source apportionment of PM2.5 and CO2, and obtained impacts of common sources on PM2.5-CO2 using an ensemble source apportionment method. Then, machine learning (ML) methods were utilized to study the effects of different drivers (including main pollution sources and meteorological factors) on PM2.5 and CO2. The results demonstrate that coal combustion (40%), vehicle exhaust (37%), and industrial emissions (23%) were the main common sources of PM2.5 and CO2. Controlling the combustion of fossil fuels and long-term vehicle electrification still hold significant importance for reducing pollutions and carbon emissions. The results of data-driven ML models show that temperature had the highest effect among meteorological factors, reflecting the seasonal changes of CO2 and PM2.5.

This study seeks to explore the effect of surface waterbody on the spatial variation of PM2.5 in Delhi-NCT. As moisture determines the concentration of PM2.5 and other pollutants in the atmosphere, the presence of surface waterbody plays a vital role in controlling PM2.5 in the local environment. We use distance to waterbodies, including other covariates of meteorology and surface characteristics, such as the surface greenness and land cover type, to model near the surface concentration of PM2.5. Different machine learning (ML) approaches were applied to predict the spatio-temporal behavior of PM2.5. Out of different ML -based models, the random forest regression produces the highest predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.68), while, gradient boosting, support vector machine and artificial neural net have R2 less than 0.66. The outcome of the feature important score from random forest regression reveals that proximity to the water surface is more important than precipitation and land use and land cover (LULC). The results find that up to a distance of 3 km, the waterbody exerts a significant effect in lowering PM2.5 concentration.

Cycling of N is sensitive to changes in climate, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and air pollution. Streamwater nitrate draining a forested ecosystem can indicate how an ecosystem is responding to these changes. We observed a pulse in streamwater nitrate concentration and export at a long-term forest research site in eastern North America that resulted in a 10-fold increase in nitrate export compared to observations over the prior decade. The pulse in streamwater nitrate occurred in a reference catchment in the 2013 water year, but was not associated with a distinct disturbance event. We analyzed a suite of environmental variables to explore possible causes. The correlation between each environmental variable and streamwater nitrate concentration was consistently higher when we accounted for the antecedent conditions of the variable prior to a given streamwater observation. In most cases, the optimal antecedent period exceeded two years. We assessed the most important variables for predicting streamwater nitrate concentration by training a machine learning model to predict streamwater nitrate concentration in the years preceding and during the streamwater nitrate pulse. The results of the correlation and machine learning analyses suggest that the pulsed increase in streamwater nitrate resulted from both (1) decreased plant uptake due to lower terrestrial gross primary production, possibly due to increased soil frost or reduced solar radiation or both; and (2) increased net N mineralization and nitrification due to warm temperatures from 2010 to 2013. Additionally, variables associated with hydrological transport of nitrate, such as maximum stream discharge, emerged as important, suggesting that hydrology played a role in the pulse. Overall, our analyses indicate that the streamwater nitrate pulse was caused by a combination of factors that occurred in the years prior to the pulse, not a single disturbance event.",BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,10.1007/s10533-023-01105-z,0,0,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These biases must be discarded and significantly increase the amount of missing data within remote sensing images. This paper expands the application of a partial convolutional neural network (PCNN) to incorporate depthwise convolution layers, conferring temporal dimensionality to the imputation process. The addition of a temporal dimension to the imputation process adds a state of successive existence within the dataset, which spatial imputation cannot capture. The depthwise convolution process enables the PCNN to independently convolve the data for each channel. The deep learning system is trained with the Community Multiscale Air Quality model-simulated tropospheric column density of Nitrogen Dioxide (TCDNO2) to impute TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument TCDNO2. The depthwise PCNN model achieves an index of agreement of 0.88 and outperforms the default PCNN models, with and without temporal dimensionality of data, and conventional data imputation methods such as inverse distance weighting by 4-7 and 10-15% in the index of agreement and correlation, respectively. The model demonstrates more consistency in the reconstruction of TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument tropospheric column density of NO2 images. The model has also demonstrated the accurate imputation of remote sensing images with over 95% of the data missing.

Therefore, in these countries, automatic surveillance systems are in high demand for close monitoring to identify and penalize vehicles emitting excessive smoke. In recent times, deep learning-based computer vision systems are rigorously working on the same. Their accuracy strongly depends on the number of the training images taken under various imaging conditions. However, there are very few publicly available vehicle smoke datasets that could be used for training purposes. To capture on-road videos for the creation of a dataset is another challenging and time-consuming task. To aid and enhance the vehicular smoke monitoring system, in this article, we propose, a holistic dual-level framework for dataset enhancement by smoke generation along with a transformer network for efficient identification. We have created a realistic vehicle smoke generation algorithm using a range of mask patterns and filtering, which helps us to train our deep neural model by generating sufficient synthetic data. We have also proposed a transformer network on the YOLOv5 backbone, which efficiently identifies the smoke region and the smoky vehicle from the image frame simultaneously.

People in big cities suffer from this issue and look for a permanent solution. This congestion causes air pollution, noise pollution, and may lead to a catastrophic situation. In big cities with large populations, traffic congestion happens daily and affects the quality of air. Various projects have been placed to resolve this issue; however, it remains unresolved, and drivers get totally annoyed. Numerous technologies, such as IoTs and deep learning are widely applied recently due to their results and costs. In this article, a novel Intelligent Adaptive Traffic Control and Management System (IATCMS) based on a deep-learning architecture and IoTs is proposed. This system utilizes Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), cameras, a Database, a Central Control Unit (CCU), and a newly developed Generative Adversarial Network (NDGAN). This approach aims to reduce congestion, provide air quality, reduce fuel consumption, control traffic, and save lives in case of accidents by letting ambulances reach destinations quickly. In addition, the method ensures smooth traffic with a reasonable speed. Various key factors, such as speed of vehicles, traffic density, length of roads, and allocated light signal times are considered to provide a feasible solution to remove or reduce congestion and minimize traffic waiting time at intersections. This algorithm determines which lane gets the highest priority to proceed first by computing the traffic density for each road and gives the lane with the highest density priority. The presented model is tested and analyzed in MATLAB. The approach reduces the average waiting time at intersections by nearly 34% to 48% and removes congestion in some scenarios. The achieved results indicate that the proposed system can be applied at any intersection around the world to provide a smooth trip and remove traffic congestion.",MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,10.1007/s11042-023-17003-3,0,0,No,,,,Saudi Arabia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to the limited availability of nighttime AOD data, PM estimation studies using AOD have focused on daytime. Recently, the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) produced nighttime AOD, called lunar AOD, providing an opportunity to estimate nighttime PM. Nighttime AOD measurements are particularly important as they help fill gaps in our understanding of aerosol variability and its impact on the atmosphere, as there are significant variations in AOD between day and night. In this study, the relationship between lunar AOD and PM was investigated using data from AERONET station, meteorological station, and air pollution station in Seoul Metropolitan area from May 2016 to December 2019, and then PM estimation model was developed covering both daytime and nighttime using random forest machine learning techniques. We have found the differences in the importance of variables affecting the AOD-PM relationship between day and night from the random forest model. The AOD-PM relationship in the daytime was more affected by time-related variables, such as the day of the year among the variables. The new model was developed using additional lunar AOD data to estimate continuous PM concentrations. The results have shown that the model based on lunar AOD data estimated well PM10 and PM2.5 with similar performance of model using solar AOD.

Climate change impacts human health directly through temperature fluctuations and indirectly via factors like disease vectors. Elevated and reduced temperatures have been linked to increases in CVD-related hospitalizations and mortality, with various studies worldwide confirming the significant health implications of temperature variations and air pollution on cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: A database of daily Emergency Room admissions at the Giovanni XIII Polyclinic in Bari (Southern Italy) was developed, spanning from 2013 to 2019, including weather and air quality data. A Random Forest (RF) supervised machine learning model was used to simulate the trend of hospital admissions for CVD. The Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) decomposition model separated the trend component, while cross-validation techniques were employed to prevent overfitting. Model performance was assessed using specific metrics and error analysis. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, a feature importance technique within the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework, was used to identify the feature importance. Results: An R2 of 0.97 and a Mean Absolute Error of 0.36 admissions were achieved by the model. Atmospheric pressure, minimum temperature, and carbon monoxide were found to collectively contribute about 74% to the model's predictive power, with atmospheric pressure being the dominant factor at 37%.

We conceived a nationwide longitudinal study from 2011 through 2015, by enrolling 13,614 participants aged 45 and above from 28 provincial regions across mainland of China. Lung function in each survey wave was measured as peak expiratory flow (PEF) repeatedly by welltrained interviewers using standardized devices. We assigned the exposures to ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2 and O-3) of participants according to their residential cities at baseline, via deriving monthly estimates from well-validated spatiotemporal datasets developed by machine learning methods. Possible exposure biases were examined through Monte Carlo simulation approach with 1000 random simulations of the residential addresses for each participant. The associations of long-term air pollution exposure with PEF and PEF z-score were assessed using mixed-effects linear models. We compared estimated effects of each pollutant with the effect of aging on lung function to elevate interpretability of the association magnitude. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential effect modifiers. We evaluated totally 34,196 repeated measurements of lung function from 13,614 adults.

An increase of 10-mu g/m(3) in annual PM2.5, NO2 and O-3 exposure was respectively associated with a decline in PEF of 14.6 (95% confidence interval: 13.1-16.2) L/min, 21.7 (19.6-23.8) L/min, and 25.5 (20.6-30.4) L/min, which were equivalent to the effects of aging by 3.9-7.3 years and percent declines of 4.9-8.5%. We observed approximately linear relationships between PEF and PM2.5 and O-3, while a reversely J-shaped NO2-PEF relation was identified with steeper drops below 30 mu g/m(3). Stratified analyses suggested significantly greater lung function impairment associated with ambient air pollutants in men, younger (<65), and less-educated adults. Our primary findings were robust to the sensitivity analyses based on Monte Carlo simulation approach with 1000 simulations, as well as adjustments for co-pollutant analyses. This study provided national evidence that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5, NO2 and O-3 may be independently associated with reduced lung function in Chinese middle-aged and older adults. Improvement of air quality may substantially offset the deterioration of lung function due to ageing in LMICs.",ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH,10.1016/j.apr.2023.101899,0,0,No,,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of binary classification is based on two machine learning classifiers (random forest (RF) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN)). Six models based on the feature selection methods of RF feature importance and Pearson correlation matrix are presented. The classification tasks include two resampling approaches (random oversampling and random undersampling) to address the problem of an imbalanced dataset of the visibility event classes. An important finding is that oversampling outperforms undersampling for the evaluated classifiers and achieves higher scores in terms of accuracy and F1 score metrics. The RF classifier has a better performance compared to the KNN in both sampling approaches. The RF classifier with oversampling approach provides the best overall performance in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC). The best model has scores above 0.95 based on all the evaluation metrics considered in the study. Air temperature and dewpoint temperature have minimal impact on the performance, whereas the particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 mu m (PM10) has a profound impact on the performance. It is found that the PM10 has the highest importance (52%) for the low visibility events based on the analysis of RF feature importance. Other pollutants and meteorological variables show relative importance between 5 and 10% for low visibility events. Overall, the best model is found when all variables, except temperature and dewpoint temperature, are employed to predict the visibility classes.",THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s00704-023-04697-6,0,0,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We summarize the value of posing questions about interventions, how a group of techniques known as ""g-methods"" can provide advantages for estimating intervention effects, and how investigators have grappled with the strong assumptions required for causal inference. Recent Findings We identified nine studies that estimated health effects of hypothetical interventions on early-life environmental exposures. Of these, six examined air pollution. Interventions evaluated by these studies included setting exposure levels at a specific value, shifting exposure distributions, and limiting exposure levels to less than a threshold value. Only one study linked exposure contrasts to a specific intervention on an exposure source, however. There is growing interest in estimating intervention effects of early-life environmental exposures, in part because intervention effects are directly related to possible public health actions. Future studies can build on existing work by linking research questions to specific hypothetical interventions that could reduce exposure levels. We discuss how framing questions around interventions can help overcome some of the barriers to causal inference and how advances related to machine learning may strengthen studies by sidestepping the overly restrictive assumptions of parametric regression models. By leveraging advancements in causal inference and exposure science, an intervention framework for environmental epidemiology can guide actionable solutions to improve children's environmental health.",CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS,10.1007/s40572-022-00388-y,0,0,No,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using deep learning methods to fit the quantitative relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and PM2.5 (AOD-PM2.5) has received extensive attention. In this study, based on the correlation between AOD and PM2.5 data, a new network model BiCNN is proposed by using the satellite-ground synergy method, aiming to obtain the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration in the MRYRA. Data from MRYRA 2019 is used for model training and testing. The results show that BiCNN exhibits the best estimation on the annual scale, with a fit coefficient R2 of 0.836 and the smallest error, RMSE of 6.746 and MAPE of 12.497 compared to the benchmark model. The model effectively improves the relationship between AOD-PM2.5. The spatial distribution of PM2.5 in the MRYRA from 2019 to 2022 by applying the BiCNN model inversion shows that the PM2.5 concentration is higher in 2020, but the overall air quality improves year by year. Seasonal evaluation results show that BiCNN has a significant advantage in PM2.5 estimation in autumn, with R2 reaching 0.883. The spatial distribution of PM2.5 shows a spatial pattern of higher in spring and winter, lower in summer and autumn, and transition in autumn. The BiCNN model integrates the advantages of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (BiLSTM), makes full use of historical and future data, and can effectively capture the temporal and spatial characteristics between cofactors and PM2.5 data. It has achieved ideal results in the PM2.5 estimation of the MRYRA and provides an effective scientific method for air pollution control in urban agglomerations.",THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s00704-023-04775-9,0,0,No,,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposome research encompasses all external and internal non-genetic factors influencing the health of the population, such as air pollution, green spaces, noise, work conditions, physical activity, and diet. Due to the wide scope of the interdisciplinary project, the historical study of the exposome in Belval involved the collection of quantitative and qualitative data from the National Archive of Luxembourg, various local archives (e.g., the communes of Esch-sur-Alzette and Sanem), the National Library, the Library of National Statistics STATEC, the National Geoportal of Luxembourg, scientific data from other research centers, and information from newspapers and journals digitized in eluxemburgensia.1 The data collection and the resulting inventory were performed to create a proof of concept to critically test the potential of a multi-layered research design for the study of the historical exposome in Belval. The guiding navigation tool throughout the project was data visualization. It has facilitated the exploration of the data collected (or just the data) and the metadata. It has also been a valuable tool for mapping knowledge and defining the scope of the project. Furthermore, different data visualization techniques have helped us to reflect on the process of knowledge sharing, to understand how the relevance of certain topics changed throughout the project and why, and to learn about the publication process in different journals and the experience of the participants. Data visualization is used not only as a means to an end but also to embrace the idea of sandcastles using a speculative and process-oriented approach to advance knowledge within all research fields involved.

As such, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the fields that have significantly adopted the CPS approach to improving people's lives in smart cities by reducing energy consumption and air pollution. Therefore, autonomous vehicle-cyber physical systems (AV-CPSs) have attracted enormous investments from major corporations and are projected to be widely used. However, AV-CPS is vulnerable to cyber and physical threat vectors due to the deep integration of information technology (IT), including cloud computing, with the communication process. Cloud computing is critical in providing the scalable infrastructure required for real-time data processing, storage, and analysis in AV-CPS, allowing these systems to work seamlessly in smart cities. CPS components such as sensors and control systems through network infrastructure are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks targeted by attackers using the communication system. This paper proposes an intelligent intrusion detection system (IIDS) for AV-CPS using transfer learning to identify cyberattacks launched against connected physical components of AVs through a network infrastructure. First, AV-CPS was developed by implementing the controller area network (CAN) and integrating it into the AV simulation model. Second, the dataset was generated from the AV-CPS. The collected dataset was then preprocessed to be trained and tested via pre-trained CNNs. Third, eight pre-trained networks were implemented, namely, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, ShuffleNet, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Taiwan, and early detection can improve the survival rate of patients. The system uses a 3D interpretable hierarchical semantic convolutional neural network (HSNet) that can recognize different features of lung nodules, such as calcification, margin, texture, sphericity, and malignancy. The system achieves better performance than previous methods, with high accuracy and interpretability.Abstract Lung cancer is typically classified into small-cell carcinoma and non-small-cell carcinoma. Non-small-cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. Low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) can quickly and non-invasively diagnose lung cancer. In the era of deep learning, an artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided diagnosis system can be developed for the automatic recognition of CT images of patients, creating a new form of intelligent medical service. For many years, lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Taiwan, with smoking and air pollution increasing the likelihood of developing the disease. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma in never-smoking women has also increased significantly in recent years, resulting in an important public health problem. Early detection of lung cancer and prompt treatment can help reduce the mortality rate of patients with lung cancer. In this study, an improved 3D interpretable hierarchical semantic convolutional neural network named HSNet was developed and validated for the automatic diagnosis of lung cancer based on a collection of lung nodule images.

However, along with several other factors, drastic rise in pollution and climate changes are causes to deteriorate agricultural production, and have reached an irrevocable threshold. The climate change and pollution affecting agriculture lead to food insecurity and threaten livelihood opportunities; a significant chunk of the population relies upon and thrives. Sustainable agriculture and its economic contribution are intertwined dimensions of sustainable development that have been overlooked in the past. Therefore, the research proposes a novel analytical framework to link factors affecting agriculture trade intensity. The study used a dataset of 137 countries worldwide from 2002 to 2018 to empirically evaluate the objectives. Initially, along with other several diagnostic check, the novel technique of machine learning Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) algorithms utilizes for choosing a suitable variable and model. The findings of the Kao cointegration test reveal that all selected determinants, including moderators, exhibit long-term cointegration linkages with economic contribution of agricultural export. The research found that imports value, urbanization, population size, unemployment, and inflation rate negatively and significantly affect agricultural export economic performance, whereas economic growth, agriculture liberalization, globalization, financial openness, institution quality, and agriculture production have a positive and significant influence on the intensity of agriculture exports. Furthermore, human capital reinforces the positive effects of agricultural production on agricultural export intensity in the long run. In contrast, climate change and air pollution diminish the positive impact of agriculture production on agricultural export intensity in the long run.

This study presents a comprehensive method to estimate average tropospheric NO2 emission strengths derived from 4-year (May 2018-June 2022) TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations by combining a wind-assigned anomaly approach and a machine learning (ML) method, the so-called gradient descent algorithm. This combined approach is firstly applied to the Saudi Arabian capital city of Riyadh, as a test site, and yields a total emission rate of 1:09 x 1026 molec. s(-1). The ML-trained anomalies fit very well with the wind-assigned anomalies, with an R-2 value of 1.0 and a slope of 0.99. Hotspots of NO2 emissions are apparent at several sites: over a cement plant and power plants as well as over areas along highways. Using the same approach, an emission rate of 1 :99 x 10(25) molec. s(-1) is estimated in the Madrid metropolitan area, Spain. Both the estimate and spatial pattern are comparable with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inventory. Weekly variations in NO2 emission are highly related to anthropogenic activities, such as the transport sector. The NO2 emissions were reduced by 16% at weekends in Riyadh, and high reductions were found near the city center and in areas along the highway. An average weekend reduction estimate of 28% was found in Madrid. The regions with dominant sources are located in the east of Madrid, where residential areas and the Madrid-Barajas airport are located. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, the NO2 emissions decreased by 21% in March-June 2020 in Riyadh compared with the same period in 2019. A much higher reduction (62 %) is estimated for Madrid, where a very strict lockdown policy was implemented. The high emission strengths during lockdown only persist in the residential areas, and they cover smaller areas on weekdays compared with weekends. The spatial patterns of NO2 emission strengths during lockdown are similar to those observed at weekends in both cities. Although our analysis is limited to two cities as test examples, the method has proven to provide reliable and consistent results. It is expected to be suitable for other trace gases and other target regions. However, it might become challenging in some areas with complicated emission sources and topography, and specific NO2 decay times in different regions and seasons should be taken into account. These impacting factors should be considered in the future model to further reduce the uncertainty budget.",ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES,10.5194/amt-16-2237-2023,0,0,Yes,,,,"Peoples R China,Germany,Spain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By conceiving an individual-level case-crossover study in central China, this analysis primarily aimed to quantify PM-mortality associations and examined the modification effect of greenness on the relationship.Methods We investigated a total of 177,058 nonaccidental death cases from 12 counties in central China, 2008-2012. Daily residential exposures to PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter <2.5 <mu>m), PMc (aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 and 10 mu m), and PM10 (aerodynamic diameter <10 <mu>m) were assessed at a 1 x 1-km resolution through satellite-derived machine-learning models. Residential surrounding greenness was assessed using satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at multiple buffer sizes (250, 500, and 1000 m). To quantify the acute mortality risks associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5, PMc, and PM10, a time-stratified case-crossover design was utilized in conjunction with a conditional logistic regression model in our main analyses. To investigate the effect modification of greenness on PM-mortality associations, we grouped death cases into low, medium, and high greenness levels using cutoffs of 25th and 75th percentiles of NDVI or EVI exposure, and examined potential effect heterogeneity in PM-related mortality risks among these groups.Results Mean concentrations (standard deviation) on the day of death were 73.8 (33.4) mu g/m(3) for PM2.5, 43.9 (17.3) mu g/m(3) for PMc, and 117.5 (44.9) mu g/m(3) for PM10. Size-fractional PM exposures were consistently exhibited significant associations with elevated risks of nonaccidental and circulatory mortality. For every increase of 10-mu g/m(3) in PM exposure, percent excess risks of nonaccidental and circulatory mortality were 0.271 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.010, 0.533) and 0.487 (95% CI: 0.125, 0.851) for PM2.5 at lag-01 day, 0.731 (95% CI: 0.108, 1.359) and 1.140 (95% CI: 0.267, 2.019) for PMc at lag-02 day, and 0.271 (95% CI: 0.010, 0.533) and 0.386 (95% CI: 0.111, 0.662) for PM10 at lag-01 day, respectively. Compared to participants in the low-level greenness areas, those being exposed to higher greenness were found to be at lower PM-associated risks of nonaccidental and circulatory mortality. Consistent evidence for alleviated risks in medium or high greenness group was observed in subpopulations of female and younger groups (age <75).Conclusions Short-term exposure to particulate air pollution was associated with elevated risks of nonaccidental and circulatory death, and individuals residing in higher neighborhood greenness possessed lower risk of PM-related mortality.
