Accordingly, a DLNN structure with 192 neurons in 3 hidden layers was proposed to construct an inference model that predicts different levels of susceptibility to flash flood. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the sigmoid were selected as the activate function and the transfer function, respectively, whereas the Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) was used to update and optimize the weights of the DLNN. A database for the study area, which includes factors of elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall, was established to train and validate the proposed model. Feature selection was carried out for these factors using the Information gain ratio. The results show that the DLNN attains a good prediction accuracy with Classification Accuracy Rate = 92.05%, Positive Predictive Value = 94.55% and Negative Predictive Value = 89.55%. Compared to benchmarks, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and Support Vector Machine, the DLNN performs better; therefore, it could be concluded that the proposed hybridization of GIS and deep learning can be a promising tool to assist the government authorities and involving parties in flash flood mitigation and land-use planning.

Due to the dynamic and complex nature of the flash flood, it is challenging to predict the sites which are vulnerable to flash floods. Therefore, earlier identification of flash flood susceptible sites can be performed using advanced machine learning models for managing flood disasters. In this study, we applied and assessed two new hybrid ensemble models, namely Dagging and Random Subspace (RS) coupled with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which are the other three state-of-the-art machine learning models for modelling flood susceptibility maps at the Teesta River basin, the northern region of Bangladesh. The application of these models includes twelve flood influencing factors with 413 current and former flooding points, which were transferred in a GIS environment. The information gain ratio, the multicollinearity diagnostics tests were employed to determine the association between the occurrences and flood influential factors. For the validation and the comparison of these models, for the ability to predict the statistical appraisal measures such as Freidman, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and t-paired tests and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) were employed. The value of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ROC was above 0.80 for all models. For flood susceptibility modelling, the Dagging model performs superior, followed by RF, the ANN, the SVM, and the RS, then the several benchmark models. The methodology and solution-oriented results presented in this paper will assist the regional as well as local authorities and the policy-makers for mitigating the risks related to floods and also help in developing appropriate mitigation measures to avoid potential damages.

To train the two stand-alone models and their ensembles, for the first stage, the areas affected in the past by torrential phenomena are identified using remote sensing techniques. Approximately 70% of these areas are used as a training data set along with 10 flash-flood predictors. It should be remarked that the remote sensing techniques play a crucial role in obtaining eight out of 10 flash-flood conditioning factors. The predictive capability of predictors is evaluated through the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) method. As expected, the slope angle results in the factor with the highest predictive capability. The application of the AHP model implies the construction of ten pair-wise comparison matrices for calculating the normalized weights of each flash-flood predictor. The computed weights are used as input data in kNN-AHP and KS-AHP ensemble models for calculating the Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI). The FFPI also is determined through kNN and KS stand-alone models. The performance of the models is evaluated using statistical metrics (i.e., sensitivity, specificity and accuracy) while the validation of the results is done by constructing the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) values and by calculating the density of torrential pixels within FFPI classes.

How to recommend services to users to meet their individual needs becomes the key issue in service recommendation. In recent years, methods based on collaborative filtering (CF) have been widely proposed for service recommendation. However, traditional CF typically exploits only low-dimensional and linear interactions between users and services and is challenged by the problem of data sparsity in the real world. To address these issues, inspired by deep learning, this article proposes a new deep CF model for service recommendation, named location-aware deep CF (LDCF). This model offers the following innovations: 1) the location features are mapped into high-dimensional dense embedding vectors; 2) the multilayer-perceptron (MLP) captures the high-dimensional and nonlinear characteristics; and 3) the similarity adaptive corrector (AC) is first embedded in the output layer to correct the predictive quality of service. Equipped with these, LDCF can not only learn the high-dimensional and nonlinear interactions between users and services but also significantly alleviate the data sparsity problem. Through substantial experiments conducted on a real-world Web service dataset, results indicate that LDCF's recommendation performance obviously outperforms nine state-of-the-art service recommendation methods.",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS,10.1109/tsmc.2019.2931723,100,34,No,"Peoples R China,Australia,Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iran has been among the most devastated regions affected by the major floods. While the temporal flash-flood forecasting models are mainly developed for warning systems, the models for assessing hazardous areas can greatly contribute to adaptation and mitigation policy-making and disaster risk reduction. Former researches in the flash-flood hazard mapping have heightened the urge for the advancement of more accurate models. Thus, the current research proposes the state-of-the-art ensemble models of boosted generalized linear model (GLMBoost) and random forest (RF), and Bayesian generalized linear model (BayesGLM) methods for higher performance modeling. Furthermore, a pre-processing method, namely simulated annealing (SA), is used to eliminate redundant variables from the modeling process. Results of the modeling based on the hit and miss analysis indicates high performance for both models (accuracy = 90â92%, Kappa = 79â84%, Success ratio = 94â96%, Threat score = 80â84%, and Heidke skill score = 79â84%). The variables of distance from the stream, vegetation, drainage density, land use, and elevation have shown more contribution among others for modeling the flash-flood. The results of this study can significantly facilitate mapping the hazardous areas and further assist watershed managers to control and remediate induced damages of flood in the data-scarce regions.

However, most existing machine learning methods for assessing flash flood risk rely on a single classifier, which is suitable for processing small sets of sample data, but the resulting prediction accuracy and generalization ability are insufficient. Meanwhile, machine learning methods that integrate multiple classifiers are thus far unknown. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an excellent algorithm for ensemble learning methods which has achieved remarkable results in many fields. It not only optimizes the algorithm but also automatically applies the CPU's multi-threading to perform parallel calculations, thus greatly improving the model training speed and prediction accuracy. Therefore, this article introduces the XGBoost model for the assessment of flash flood risk, and then combines the two input strategies and the Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model to verify its optimal effect, thus proposing the XGBoost-based method for flash flood risk assessment. Subsequently, an attribution analysis was implemented to assess the possible errors of this approach; and finally, a county-level flash flood risk map for Yunnan Province, China, was generated based on the proposed method. The results demonstrate that: (1) XGBoost performs well, with an accuracy of 0.84 in the testing period, and its five indices (precision, recall, accuracy, kappa, and F-score) are all higher than those of LSSVM. (2) The XGBoost-based approach provided the reliable flash flood risk maps, which were validated by another flash flood inventory, although some errors may be attributed to critical environmental factors and statistical disaster location accuracy. (3) The high-risk counties (including high-risk and highest-risk) accounted for 40.3%, with the highest-risk counties mainly concentrated in southeastern Yunnan. This article further addresses the limitations of XGBoost (e.g., as a time-consuming greedy algorithm, the non-necessity of multi-threaded optimization). All of the above results indicate that the XGBoost-based method is an effective method for obtaining high-quality county-level flash flood risk maps, which contributes to the theoretical basis for ongoing county-level flash flood prevention in China.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126382,86,29,Yes,"Peoples R China,England","XGB,SVM",Yes,Yunnan province - 390000 km 2,Flash flood inventory from China Water Resources Department  (2011-2015) and  the China Meteorological Department Statistics (2018–2019).,"Binary points

This study proposed novel integrative flood susceptibility prediction models based on multi-time resampling approaches, random subsampling (RS) and bootstrapping (BT) algorithms, integrated with machine learning models: generalized additive model (GAM), boosted regression tree (BTR) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). RS and BT algorithms provided 10 runs of data resampling for learning and validation of the models. Then the mean of 10 runs of predictions is used to produce the flood susceptibility maps (FSM). This methodology was applied to Ardabil Province on coastal margins of the Caspian Sea which faced destructive floods. The area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and true skill statistic (TSS) and correlation coefficient (COR) were utilized to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the proposed models. Results demonstrated that resampling algorithms improved the performance of Standalone GAM, MARS and BRT models. Results also revealed that Standalone models had better performance with the BT algorithm compared to the RS algorithm. BT-GAM model attained superior performance in terms of statistical measures (AUC = 0.98, TSS = 0.93, COR = 0.91), followed by BT-MARS (AUC = 0.97, TSS = 0.91, COR = 0.91) and BT-BRT model (AUC = 0.95, TSS = 0.79, COR = 0.79).

To train the two stand-alone models and their ensembles, for the first stage, the areas affected in the past by torrential phenomena are identified using remote sensing techniques. Approximately 70% of these areas are used as a training data set along with 10 flash-flood predictors. It should be remarked that the remote sensing techniques play a crucial role in obtaining eight out of 10 flash-flood conditioning factors. The predictive capability of predictors is evaluated through the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) method. As expected, the slope angle results in the factor with the highest predictive capability. The application of the AHP model implies the construction of ten pair-wise comparison matrices for calculating the normalized weights of each flash-flood predictor. The computed weights are used as input data in kNN-AHP and KS-AHP ensemble models for calculating the Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI). The FFPI also is determined through kNN and KS stand-alone models. The performance of the models is evaluated using statistical metrics (i.e., sensitivity, specificity and accuracy) while the validation of the results is done by constructing the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) values and by calculating the density of torrential pixels within FFPI classes. Overall, the best performance is obtained by the kNN-AHP ensemble model.

Deep learning algorithms have been gaining attention in geoscience due to their high performance and flexibility. However, an understanding of the potential for these algorithms to provide fast, cheap, and accurate predictions of soil erosion susceptibility is lacking. This study provides the first quantification of this potential. Spatial predictions of susceptibility are made using three deep learning algorithms - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) - for an Iranian catchment that has historically experienced severe water erosion. Through a comparison of their predictive performance and an analysis of the driving geo-environmental factors, the results reveal: (1) elevation was the most effective variable on SWE susceptibility; (2) all three developed models had good prediction performance, with RNN being marginally the most superior; (3) maps of SWE susceptibility revealed that almost 40 % of the catchment was highly or very highly susceptible to SWE and 20 % moderately susceptible, indicating the critical need for soil erosion control in this catchment. Through these algorithms, the soil erosion susceptibility of catchments can potentially be predicted accurately and with ease using readily available data. Thus, the results reveal that these models have great potential for use in data poor catchments, such as the one studied here, especially in developing nations where technical modeling skills and understanding of the erosion processes occurring in the catchment may be lacking.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129229,25,25,No,"United States,South Korea,England,Sweden,Russia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How to recommend services to users to meet their individual needs becomes the key issue in service recommendation. In recent years, methods based on collaborative filtering (CF) have been widely proposed for service recommendation. However, traditional CF typically exploits only low-dimensional and linear interactions between users and services and is challenged by the problem of data sparsity in the real world. To address these issues, inspired by deep learning, this article proposes a new deep CF model for service recommendation, named location-aware deep CF (LDCF). This model offers the following innovations: 1) the location features are mapped into high-dimensional dense embedding vectors; 2) the multilayer-perceptron (MLP) captures the high-dimensional and nonlinear characteristics; and 3) the similarity adaptive corrector (AC) is first embedded in the output layer to correct the predictive quality of service. Equipped with these, LDCF can not only learn the high-dimensional and nonlinear interactions between users and services but also significantly alleviate the data sparsity problem. Through substantial experiments conducted on a real-world Web service dataset, results indicate that LDCF's recommendation performance obviously outperforms nine state-of-the-art service recommendation methods.",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS,10.1109/TSMC.2019.2931723,70,24,No,"Peoples R China,Australia,Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lai Chau, a province in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam was chosen as a case study since it had recently undergone severe flashflood in 2018. For this purpose, numerical predictor variables such as topographically derived factors (Digital Elevation Model, Aspect, Slope, Curvature, Topographic Wetness Index), climatic variables (Rain), and hydrological variables (stream density, stream power index, distance to river) and multiple remote sensing indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Buildup Index) were used. These predictor variables were selected because they are globally collectible and reproducible. The performances of these models were evaluated by using common statistical indicators, namely Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Overall Accuracy and Area under Receiving Operating Characteristics, and the statistical test of differences. The results showed that the proposed swarm intelligence models outperformed benchmarked methods, namely Particle Swarm Optimization, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest in almost all comparing indicators. It is suggested that proposed models are more robust than the classifiers, which were used for benchmarking and they are good alternatives for flood susceptibility mapping given the availability of dataset.

Hence, identifying the susceptible areas to flood is an important task for every country to prevent such dangerous consequences. The present study developed a framework for identifying flood-prone areas of the Top?a river basin, Slovakia using geographic information system (GIS), multi-criteria decision making approach (MCDMA), bivariate statistics (Frequency Ratio (FR), Statistical Index (SI)) and machine learning (NaÃ¯ve Bayes Tree (NBT), Logistic Regression (LR)). To reach such a goal, different physical-geographical factors (criteria) were integrated and mapped. To access the relationship and interdependences among the criteria, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP) were used. Based on the expertsâ decisions, the DEMATEL-ANP model was used to compute the relative weights of different criteria and a GIS-based linear combination was performed to derive the susceptibility index. Separately, the flood susceptibility index computation through NBT-FR and NBT-SI hybrid models assumed, in the first stage, the estimation of the weight of each class/category of conditioning factor through SI and FR and the integration of these values in NBT algorithm. The application of LR stand-alone required the calculation of the weights of conditioning factors by analysing their spatial relation with the location of the historical flood events. The study revealed that very high and high flood susceptibility classes covered between 20% and 47% of the study area, respectively. The validation of results, using the past flood points, highlighted that the hybrid DEMATEL-ANP model was the most performant with an Area Under ROC curve higher than 0.97, an accuracy of 0.922 and a value of HSS of 0.844. The presented methodological approach used for the identification of flood susceptible areas can serve as an alternative for the updating of preliminary flood risk assessment based on the EU Floods Directive.

At first, we construct maps depicting the most effective factors on floods (12 factors), forest fires (10 factors), and landslides (10 factors), and used the Boruta algorithm to prioritize the impact of each respective factor on the occurrence of each hazard. Subsequently, flood, landslides, and forest fire susceptibility maps prepared using a Random Forest (RF) model in the R statistical software. Results indicate that 42.83% of the study area are not susceptible to any hazards, while 2.67% of the area is at risk of all three hazards. The results of the multi-hazard map in Shiraz City indicate that 25% of Shiraz city is very susceptible to flooding, while 16% is very susceptible to landslide occurrences. For four strategic watersheds, it is notable that in the Dorodzan Watershed, landslides and floods are the most important hazards; whereas, flood occurrences cover the largest area of the Maharlou Watershed. In contrast, the Tashk-Bakhtegan Watershed is so sensible to floods and landslides, respectively. Finally, in the Ghareaghaj Watershed, forest fire ranks as the strongest hazard, followed by floods. The validation results indicate an AUC of 0.834, 0.939, and 0.943 for the flood, landslide, and forest fire susceptibility maps, respectively. Also, other accuracy measures including, specificity, sensitivity, TSS, CCI, and Gini coefficient confirmed results of the AUC values.

With this objective, we proposed and compared several novel hybrid computational approaches of machine learning methods for flash flood susceptibility mapping, namely AdaBoostM1 based Credal Decision Tree (ABM-CDT); Bagging based Credal Decision Tree (Bag-CDT); Dagging based Credal Decision Tree (Dag-CDT); MultiBoostAB based Credal Decision Tree (MBAB-CDT), and single Credal Decision Tree (CDT). These models were applied at a catchment of Markazi state in Iran. About 320 past flash flood events and nine flash flood influencing factors, namely distance from rivers, aspect, elevation, slope, rainfall, distance from faults, soil, land use, and lithology were considered and analyzed for the development of flash flood susceptibility maps. Correlation based feature selection method was used to validate and select the important factors for modeling of flash floods. Based on this feature selection analysis, only eight factors (distance from rivers, aspect, elevation, slope, rainfall, soil, land use, and lithology) were selected for the modeling, where distance to rivers is the most important factor for modeling of flash flood in this area. Performance of the models was validated and compared by using several robust metrics such as statistical measures and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) curve. The results of this study suggested that ABM-CDT (AUC = 0.957) has the best predictive capability in terms of accuracy, followed by Dag-CDT (AUC = 0.947), MBAB-CDT (AUC = 0.933), Bag-CDT (AUC = 0.932), and CDT (0.900), respectively.

The main objective of this study is to use a new machine-learning method to create three models: best-first decision tree (BFT), a bagging best-first decision tree (BBFT) ensemble and a dagging best-first decision tree (DBFT) ensemble to spatially predict flood probability. Twelve conditioning-factor measures for 272 locations of past floods were used to train and test three models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity (SST), specificity (SPF), accuracy (ACC), kappa (K), and root mean square error (RMSE) are applied to compare and validate the models. The results are that all three models performed well in mapping, flood probabilities (AUC > 0.904). The BBFT model was best, however, with an AUC = 0.96. Based on the results of the Relief-F attribute evaluation method, two soil and slope factors were weighted highest among the parameters, indicating that they are the most important flood-conditioning factors.

Consequently, people have been experiencing tremendous damage to properties, infrastructures, and human casualties. Usually, floods are one of the devastating disasters from nature, but for developing nations like Bangladesh, flooding becomes worse. Due to the dynamic and complex nature of the flooding, the prediction of flooding sites was usually very difficult for flood management. But the artificial intelligence and advanced remote sensing techniques together could predict and identify the possible sites, which are vulnerable to flooding. The present work aimed to predict and identify the flooding sites or flood susceptible zones in the Teesta River basin by employing state-of-the-art novel ensemble machine learning algorithms. We developed ensembles of bagging with REPtree, random forest (RF), M5P, and random tree (RT) algorithms for obtaining reliable and highly accurate results. Twelve factors, which are considered as the conditioning factors, and 413 current and former flooding points were identified for flooding susceptibility modelling. The Information Gain ratio statistical technique was utilized to determine the influence of the factors for flooding. We applied receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for validation of the flood susceptible models. The Freidman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, KruskalâWallis test and KolmogorovâSmirnov test were applied together for the first time in flood susceptibility modelling to compare the models with each other. Results showed that more than 800Â km2 area was predicted as the very high flood susceptibility zones by all algorithms. The ROC curve showed that all models achieved more than 0.85 area under the curve indicating highly accurate flood models. For flood susceptibility modelling, the bagging with M5P performed superior, followed by bagging with RF, bagging with REPtree and bagging with RT. The methodology and solution-oriented results presented in this paper will assist the regional as well as local authorities and the policy-makers for mitigating the risks related to floods and also help in developing appropriate measures to avoid potential damages.

Assessing the hazard they pose and what drives their movement in the years following the mainshock has not yet been attempted, primarily because multitemporal landslide inventories are lacking. By exploiting a multitemporal inventory (2005-2018) covering the epicentral region of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and a set of conditioning factors (seismic, topographic, and hydrological), we perform statistical tests to understand the temporal evolution of these factors affecting debris remobilizations. Our analyses, supported by a random-forest susceptibility assessment model, reveal a prediction capability of seismic-related variables declining with time, as opposed to hydro-topographic parameters gaining importance and becoming predominant within a decade. These results may have important implications on the way conventional susceptibility/hazard assessment models should be employed in areas where coseismic landslides are the main sediment production mechanism on slopes. Plain Language Summary Strong earthquakes in mountain regions can trigger thousands of landslides, forming deposits of rock and soil debris along steep slopes. Months to years later, rainstorms may generate debris flows-destructive water-debris mixtures that rush downslope and flood valleys. Scientists use models to estimate the hazard of landslides and debris flows, which are based on accurate maps of the slopes, the type of rock or soil, inventories of known landslides, rainfall trends, and more. Susceptibility and hazard maps are the main product of these models. They are used to predict the probability of a hazardous event occurring at a given location in a given time span. These maps are usually ""static,"" in the sense that they are thought to remain valid for a long time because the data they are based upon (such as the shape of slopes) do not vary much. However, postearthquake landscapes are very dynamic: debris moves downslope, carried by rain or shaken by aftershocks; meanwhile, new landslides occur on some slopes, while others revegetate and stabilize. The overall picture is complex as many variables are involved. We use machine learning to demonstrate that static hazard maps become unable to predict landslides after just a few years, and advocate for the use of frequently updated maps linked to fresh inputs, tracking the location and activity of debris deposits, and old and new",GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,10.1029/2020gl090509,54,18,No,"Peoples R China,Czech Republic,Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, flood susceptibility (FS) mapping is indeed necessary to overcome this type of natural hazard phenomena. With this in mind, we evaluated the prediction performance of FS mapping in the Koiya River basin, Eastern India. The present research work was done through preparation of a sophisticated flood inventory map; eight flood conditioning variables were selected based on the topography and hydro-climatological condition, and by applying the novel ensemble approach of hyperpipes (HP) and support vector regression (SVR) machine learning (ML) algorithms. The ensemble approach of HP-SVR was also compared with the stand-alone ML algorithms of HP and SVR. In relative importance of variables, distance to river was the most dominant factor for flood occurrences followed by rainfall, land use land cover (LULC), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

In this study, we modified the standard U-Net, a convolutional neural network (CNN) method, to extract water bodies from scenes captured from Sentinel-1 satellites of selected areas during the 2019 Central US flooding. We compared the results to several benchmark models, including the standard U-Net and ResNet50, an advanced thresholding method, Bmax Otsu, and a recently introduced flood inundation map archive. Then, we looked at how data input types, input resolution, and using pre-trained weights affect the model performance. We adopted a three-category classification frame to test whether and how permanent water and flood pixels behave differently. Most of the data in this study were gathered and pre-processed utilizing the open access Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. According to the results, the adjusted U-Net outperformed all other benchmark models and datasets. Adding a slope layer enhances model performance with the 30 m input data compared to training the model on only VV and VH bands of SAR images. Adding DEM and Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) model data layer improved performance for models trained on 10 m datasets. The results also suggested that CNN-based semantic segmentation may fail to correctly classify pixels around narrow river channels. Furthermore, our findings revealed that it is necessary to differentiate permanent water and flood pixels because they behave differently. Finally, the results indicated that using pre-trained weights from a coarse dataset can significantly minimize initial training loss on finer datasets and speed up convergence.

Flood susceptibility maps can improve mitigation measures according to the specific conditions of a study area. The design of flood susceptibility maps has been enhanced through use of hybrid machine learning and deep learning models. Although these models have achieved better accuracy than traditional models, they are not widely used by stakeholders due to their black-box nature. In this study, we propose the application of an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model that incorporates the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) model to interpret the outcomes of convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models, and analyze the impact of variables on flood susceptibility mapping. This study was conducted in Jinju Province, South Korea, which has a long history of flood events. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), which showed a prediction accuracy of 88.4%. SHAP plots showed that land use and various soil attributes significantly affected flood susceptibility in the study area. In light of these findings, we recommend the use of XAI-based models in future flood susceptibility mapping studies to improve interpretations of model outcomes, and build trust among stakeholders during the flood-related decision-making process.

Now, flood susceptibility modelling based on data driven model is state-of-the-art method such as ensemble learning and deep learning. However, the effect of deep learning coupling with ensemble learning models in flood susceptibility modelling is still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose three deep learning coupling with ensemble learning models by combining the deep learning (DL) with Filtered Classifier (FC), Rotation forest (RF) and Random Subspace (RSS) and explore the effect of coupling method for modelling flood susceptibility. The key step of this paper is as following: firstly, a Dingnan County which is lied in the Jiangxi Province of China is chosen as a case study, single flood event point and random sampling method was applied to generate the flood and non-flood data, respectively, then frequency ratio was utilized to analyze the relationship between each influencing factor and flood occurrence, based on the value of VIF, Spearman's correlation and One R classifier, the result show that there is no multicollinearity between each influencing factor, ten influencing factors have contribution to the flood occurrence and all of them are applied to construct the coupling model. Finally, the DL, FC-DL, RF-DL and RSS-DL were applied to produce flood susceptibility maps. Then, several statistical indexes such as area under the curve (AUC), Kappa index, accuracy (ACC), and F-measure were used to assess the accomplishment of these coupling models. For the train data, the FC-DL model acquired the highest AUC value (0.996), followed by RF-DL (0.944), RSS-DL (0.934), and DL (0.934). For the validation data, the result showed that all models have a good accomplishment (AUC>0.8). In a word, the deep learning coupling with ensemble learning models demonstrates the more reliable and excellent performance. Hence, the proposed new method will help the government for land use planning and can be applied in other area around the world.

Weather conditions continue to grow more extreme, and wildfires are occurring quite frequently and are spreading with greater intensity. Wildfires ravage forest areas, as recently seen in the Amazon, the United States, and more recently in Australia. The availability of remotely sensed data has vastly improved, and enables us to precisely locate wildfires for monitoring purposes. Wildfire inventory data was created by integrating the polygons collected through field surveys using global positioning systems (GPS) and the data collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) thermal anomalies product between 2012 and 2017 for the study area. The inventory data, along with sixteen conditioning factors selected for the study area, was used to appraise the potential of various machine learning (ML) methods for wildfire susceptibility mapping in Amol County. The ML methods chosen for this study are artificial neural network (ANN), dmine regression (DR), DM neural, least angle regression (LARS), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), radial basis function (RBF), self-organizing maps (SOM), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT), along with the statistical approach of logistic regression (LR), which is very apt for wildfire susceptibility studies. The wildfire inventory data was categorized as three-fold, with 66% being used for training the models and 33% being used for accuracy assessment within three-fold cross-validation (CV). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was used to assess the accuracy of the ML approaches. RF had the highest accuracy of 88%, followed by SVM with an accuracy of almost 79%, and LR had the lowest accuracy of 65%. This shows that RF is better suited for wildfire susceptibility assessments in our case study area.

Also, there is an evident increase of the size of the damages caused by these hazards. BÃ¢sca Chiojdului River Basin is one of the most affected areas in Romania by flash-flood phenomena. Therefore, Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI) was defined and calculated across the BÃ¢sca Chiojdului river basin by using one bivariate statistical method (Statistical Index) and its novel ensemble with the following machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Classification and Regression Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree CART. In a first stage, the areas with torrentiality were digitized based on orthophotomaps and field observations. These regions, together with an equal number of non-torrential pixels, were further divided into training surfaces (70%) and validating surfaces (30%). The next step of the analysis consisted of the selection of flash-flood conditioning factors based on the multicollinearity investigation and predictive ability estimation through Information Gain method. Eight factors, from a total of ten flash-floods predictors, were selected in order to be included in the FFPI calculation process. By applying the models represented by Statistical Index and its ensemble with the machine learning algorithms, the weight of each conditioning factor and of each factor class/category in the FFPI equations was established. Once the weight values were derived, the FFPI values across the BÃ¢sca Chiojdului river basin were calculated by overlaying the flash-flood predictors in GIS environment. According to the results obtained, the central part of BÃ¢sca Chiojdului river basin has the highest susceptibility to flash-flood phenomena. Thus, around 30% of the study site has high and very high values of FFPI. The results validation was carried out by applying the Prediction Rate and Success Rate.

Identifying areas prone to flash flooding is a crucial step in flash flood hazard management. In the present study, the Kalvan watershed in Markazi Province, Iran, was chosen to evaluate the flash flood susceptibility modeling. Thus, to detect flash flood-prone zones in this study area, five machine learning (ML) algorithms were tested. These included boosted regression tree (BRT), random forest (RF), parallel random forest (PRF), regularized random forest (RRF), and extremely randomized trees (ERT). Fifteen climatic and geo-environmental variables were used as inputs of the flash flood susceptibility models. The results showed that ERT was the most optimal model with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.82. The rest of the modelsâ AUC values, i.e., RRF, PRF, RF, and BRT, were 0.80, 0.79, 0.78, and 0.75, respectively. In the ERT model, the areal coverage for very high to moderate flash flood susceptible area was 582.56 km2 (28.33%), and the rest of the portion was associated with very low to low susceptibility zones. It is concluded that topographical and hydrological parameters, e.g., altitude, slope, rainfall, and the riverâs distance, were the most effective parameters.

Besides, two stand-alone methods, Index of Entropy (IOE) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), were also investigated. For this regard, 111 torrential points and 111 non-torrential points along with 8 flash-flood conditioning factors have been involved in the training process of the four models. The quality of the flash-flood models was checked by using the ROC Curve method, classification accuracy (CLA), and Kappa index. The result shows that the two ensemble models, the ADT-IOE (AUC = 0.972, CLC = 86.37%, Kappa statistics = 0.727) and the ADT-AHP (AUC = 0.926, CLA = 87.88%, Kappa statistics = 0.758), have high prediction performance and outperform the other models. Therefore, ADT-IOE and ADT-AHP are new and promising tools for flash-flood susceptibility modeling.

This part of the Ganga floodplain region, which under the influence of undergoing active tectonic regime related subsidence, is the hotbed of annual flood disaster. This makes the region one of the best natural laboratories to test the flood susceptibility models for establishing a universalization of such models in low relief highly flood prone areas. Based on highly sophisticated flood inventory archived for this region, and 12 flood conditioning factors viz. annual rainfall, soil type, stream density, distance from stream, distance from road, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), altitude, slope aspect, slope, curvature, land use/land cover, and geomorphology, an advanced novel hybrid model Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and three metaheuristic models-based ensembles with ANFIS namely ANFIS-GA (Genetic Algorithm), ANFIS-DE (Differential Evolution), and ANFIS-PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), have been applied for zonation of the flood susceptible areas. The flood inventory dataset, prepared by collected flood samples, were apportioned into 70:30 classes to prepare training and validation datasets. One independent validation method, the Area-Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) Curve, and other 11 cut-off-dependent model evaluation metrices have helped to conclude that the ANIFS-GA has outperformed other three models with highest success rate AUC = 0.922 and prediction rate AUC = 0.924. The accuracy was also found to be highest for ANFIS-GA during training (0.886) & validation (0.883). Better performance of ANIFS-GA than the individual models as well as some ensemble models suggests and warrants further study in this topoclimatic environment using other classes of susceptibility models. This will further help establishing a benchmark model with capability of highest accuracy and sensitivity performance in the similar topographic and climatic setting taking assumption of the quality of input parameters as constant.

A way forward is to optimally combine the global network of earth system observations with advanced numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to generate consistent spatio-temporal maps of land, ocean, and atmospheric variables of interest, which is known as a reanalysis. While the current generation of NWP models output runoff at each grid cell, they currently do not produce river discharge at catchment scales directly and thus have limited utility in hydrological applications such as flood and drought monitoring and forecasting. This is overcome in the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS; http://www.globalfloods.eu/, last access: 28 June 2020) by coupling surface and sub-surface runoff from the Hydrology Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (HTESSEL) land surface model used within ECMWF's latest global atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) with the LISFLOOD hydrological and channel routing model. The aim of this paper is to describe and evaluate the GloFAS-ERA5 global river discharge reanalysis dataset launched on 5 November 2019 (version 2.1 release). The river discharge reanalysis is a global gridded dataset with a horizontal resolution of 0.1 degrees at a daily time step. An innovative feature is that it is produced in an operational environment so is available to users from 1 January 1979 until near real time (2 to 5 d behind real time). The reanalysis was evaluated against a global network of 1801 daily river discharge observation stations. Results found that the GloFAS-ERA5 reanalysis was skilful against a mean flow benchmark in 86% of catchments according to the modified Kling-Gupta efficiency skill score, although the strength of skill varied considerably with location. The global median Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.61 with an interquartile range of 0.44 to 0.74. The long-term and operational nature of the GloFAS-ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides a valuable dataset to the user community for applications ranging from monitoring global flood and drought conditions to the identification of hydroclimatic variability and change and as raw input for post-processing and machine learning methods that can add further value.

Accurate and timely mapping of flood extent to ascertain damages is critical and essential for relief activities. Recently, deep-learning-based approaches, including convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown promising results for flood extent mapping. However, these methods cannot extract floods underneath vegetation canopy using the optical imagery. This article attempts to address this problem by introducing an integrated CNN and region growing (RG) method for the mapping of both visible and underneath vegetation flooded areas. The CNN-based classifier is used to extract flooded areas from the optical images, whereas, the RG method is applied to estimate the extent of floods underneath vegetation that are not visible from imagery using the digital elevation model. A data augmentation technique is applied for training the CNN-based classifier to improve the classification results. The results show that the data augmentation can enhance the accuracy of image classification and the proposed integrated method efficiently detects floods in both the visible and the areas covered by vegetation, which is essential to supporting effective flood emergency response and recovery activities.

However, there is a great need to examine hazards holistically to better manage the complex of threats found in any region. Many regions of the world have complex hazard landscapes wherein risk from individual and/or multiple extreme events is omnipresent. Extensive parts of Iran experience a complex array of natural hazards â floods, earthquakes, landslides, forest fires, subsidence, and drought. The effectiveness of risk mitigation is in part a function of whether the complex of hazards can be collectively considered, visualized, and evaluated. This study develops and tests individual and collective multi-hazard risk maps for floods, landslides, and forest fires to visualize the spatial distribution of risk in Fars Province, southern Iran. To do this, two well-known machine-learning algorithms â SVM and MARS â are used to predict the distribution of these events. Past floods, landslides, and forest fires were surveyed and mapped. The locations of occurrence of these events (individually and collectively) were randomly separated into training (70%) and testing (30%) data sets. The conditioning factors (for floods, landslides, and forest fires) employed to model the risk distributions are aspect, elevation, drainage density, distance from faults, geology, LULC, profile curvature, annual mean rainfall, plan curvature, distance from man-made residential structures, distance from nearest river, distance from nearest road, slope gradient, soil types, mean annual temperature, and TWI. The outputs of the two models were assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, true-skill statistics (TSS), and the correlation and deviance values from each models for each hazard. The areas-under-the-curves (AUC) for the MARS model prediction were 76.0%, 91.2%, and 90.1% for floods, landslides, and forest fires, respectively. Similarly, the AUCs for the SVM model were 75.5%, 89.0%, and 91.5%. The TSS reveals that the MARS model was better able to predict landslide risk, but was less able to predict flood-risk patterns and forest-fire risk. Finally, the combination of flood, forest fire, and landslide risk maps yielded a multi-hazard susceptibility map for the province. The better predictive model indicated that 52.3% of the province was at-risk for at least one of these hazards. This multi-hazard map may yield valuable insight for land-use planning, sustainable development of infrastructure, and also integrated watershed management in Fars Province.

A total of 28 water quality parameters were seasonally monitored at 33 sampling sites in the GBSL during 2016 to 2017 (i.e., 132 water samples were collected in four seasons). The results indicated that: 1) spatially, the western and south-western GBSL was relatively more eutrophic and polluted with heavy metals; and 2) temporally, the lakes suffered from high risks of heavy metal contamination in spring, but eutrophication in summer while water quality in winter was the best among the four seasons. Two main potential sources of pollution and transport routes were identified and discussed based on the pollution patterns. These findings contributed considerably to providing in-depth understanding of water pollution patterns, as well as potential pollution sources in the water-supplying region.

This is also a flood-prone area where flood disasters are frequently experienced; the situations between the peopleâland nexus and the peopleâwater nexus are very complicated. Therefore, the accurate assessment of flood risk is of great significance to regional development. The paper took the YRD urban agglomeration as the research case. The driving force, pressure, state, impact and response (DPSIR) conceptual framework was established to analyze the indexes of flood disasters. The random forest (RF) algorithm was used to screen important indexes of floods risk, and a risk assessment model based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network was constructed to evaluate the flood risk level in this region from 2009 to 2018. The risk map showed the I-V level of flood risk in the YRD urban agglomeration from 2016 to 2018 by using the geographic information system (GIS). Further analysis indicated that the indexes such as flood season rainfall, urban impervious area ratio, gross domestic product (GDP) per square kilometer of land, water area ratio, population density and emergency rescue capacity of public administration departments have important influence on flood risk. The flood risk has been increasing in the YRD urban agglomeration during the past ten years under the urbanization background, and economic development status showed a significant positive correlation with flood risks. In addition, there were serious differences in the rising rate of flood risks and the status quo among provinces. There are still a few cities that have stabilized at a better flood-risk level through urban flood control measures from 2016 to 2018. These results were basically in line with the actual situation, which validated the effectiveness of the model. Finally, countermeasures and suggestions for reducing the urban flood risk in the YRD region were proposed, in order to provide decision support for flood control, disaster reduction and emergency management in the YRD region.

In this study, we used four machine-learning methods, namely Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), Radial Basis Function Classifier (RBFC), Multinomial Naive Bayes (NBM), and Logistic Model Tree (LMT) to generate flash flood susceptibility maps at the minor part of Nghe An province of the Center region (Vietnam) where recurrent flood problems are being experienced. Performance of these four methods was evaluated to select the best method for flash flood susceptibility mapping. In the model studies, ten flash flood conditioning factors, namely soil, slope, curvature, river density, flow direction, distance from rivers, elevation, aspect, land use, and geology, were chosen based on topography and geo-environmental conditions of the site. For the validation of models, the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), Area Under Curve (AUC), and various statistical indices were used. The results indicated that performance of LMT model is the best among the four methods (LMT: AUC = 0.988; KLR: AUC = 0.985; RBFC: AUC = 0.984; and NBM: AUC = 0.983).

Three novel intelligence approaches, namely, baggingâfunctional tree (BFT), daggingâfunctional tree, and rotational forestâfunctional tree are used for modelling, with consideration to 15 flood conditioning factors (FCFs) as independent variables and 426 flood locations as dependent variables. Three threshold-dependent and -independent approaches are used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit and prediction capability of the ensemble models with a single functional tree (FT). These approaches include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the success rate curve (SRC) and prediction rate curve (PRC), efficiency (E) and true skill statistics (TSS). The random forest model is used to determine the relative importance of FCFs. Elevation, stream distance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) have crucial roles in the study area during flash flood occurrences. According to the results of all threshold-dependent and -independent approaches (AUC of SRC = 0.933, AUC of PRC = 0.959, E = 0.76 and TSS = 0.72), the BFT ensemble model has the greatest accuracy in terms of modelling FFS. Results also show that the performance of the FT model is enhanced by three meta-classifiers. The seed cell area index technique is also used to check model classification accuracy and reliability. Results of this technique show that all the models demonstrate good performance and reliability. However, the FFS maps prepared by machine learning ensemble techniques have excellent accuracy and reliability, as per the results of validation methods. Thus, these FFS maps can be used as a convenient tool to reduce the effect of flood in flash flood-prone areas.

Plenty of studies have used machine learning models to produce reliable susceptibility maps. Nevertheless, most research ignores the importance of developing appropriate feature engineering methods. In this study, we propose a local spatial sequential long short-term memory neural network (LSS-LSTM) for flood susceptibility prediction in Shangyou County, China. The three main contributions of this study are summarized below. First of all, it is a new perspective to use the deep learning technique of LSTM for flood susceptibility prediction. Second, we integrate an appropriate feature engineering method with LSTM to predict flood susceptibility. Third, we implement two optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization to further improve the performance of the proposed method. The LSS-LSTM method can not only capture the attribution information of flood conditioning factors and the local spatial information of flood data, but also has powerful sequential modelling capabilities to deal with the spatial relationship of floods.

To do this, land use changes over the next 20 years (2019â2040) were predicted from land use changes of the past 29 years (1990â2019) using the land change modeler (LCM) method. Future climate change was projected for the next 20 years (2020â2040) based on climate data from 1990 to 2015 using Lars-WG software and two scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Twelve factors that influence flooding and 262 locations of past floods were used to model the spatial pattern of flood susceptibility in the watershed. A random forest (RF) model and a Bayesian generalized linear model (GLMbayes) were used to predict areas susceptible to flooding. The results showed that elevation (21.55), distance from river (15.28), land use (11.1), slope (10.58), and rainfall (6.8) are the most important factors affecting flooding in this basin. The factors were modified according to land use changes and climate changes and the models were revised. The land use and climate forecasting in this region indicate that land use change, like decreased forest cover (?77.19 km2) and reduced rangeland (?218.83 km2) near rivers and downstream, can be expected and rainfall is projected to increase (under from both scenarios). These changes would result in increased probabilities of flooding in the downstream portion of the watershed and near the sea. The area-under-the-curve evaluation of the models indicates that the RF model more accurately predicted flood probability (0.91) than did the GLMbayes model (0.847).

These disasters are believed to be associated with land use changes and climate variability. However, identifying the factors that lead to flooding is challenging. This study mapped flood susceptibility in the northeast region of Bangladesh using Bayesian regularization back propagation (BRBP) neural network, classification and regression trees (CART), a statistical model (STM) using the evidence belief function (EBF), and their ensemble models (EMs) for three time periods (2000, 2014, and 2017). The accuracy of machine learning algorithms (MLAs), STM, and EMs were assessed by considering the area under the curveâreceiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC). Evaluation of the accuracy levels of the aforementioned algorithms revealed that EM4 (BRBP-CART-EBF) outperformed (AUC > 90%) standalone and other ensemble models for the three time periods analyzed. Furthermore, this study investigated the relationships among land cover change (LCC), population growth (PG), road density (RD), and relative change of flooding (RCF) areas for the period between 2000 and 2017. The results showed that areas with very high susceptibility to flooding increased by 19.72% between 2000 and 2017, while the PG rate increased by 51.68% over the same period. The Pearson correlation coefficient for RCF and RD was calculated to be 0.496. These findings highlight the significant association between floods and causative factors.

Therefore, it is crucial to develop accurate flood risk assessment maps. In this study, we proposed a flood risk assessment framework which combines flood susceptibility assessment and flood consequences (human health and financial impact) for developing a final flood risk assessment map using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. Two hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, namely ABMDT (AdaBoost-DT) and BDT (Bagging-DT) were developed with Decision Table (DT) as a base classifier for creating a flood susceptibility map. We used 847 flood locations of major flooding events in the years 2007, 2009 and 2013 in Quang Nam province of Vietnam; and 14 flood influencing factors of topography, geology, hydrology and environment to construct and validate the hybrid AI models. Various statistical measures were used to validate the models, including the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve called AUC. Results show that all the proposed models performed well, but the performance of the BDT model (AUC = 0.96) is the best in comparison to other models ABMDT (AUC = 0.953) and single DT (AUC = 0.929). Therefore, the flood susceptibility map produced by the BDT model was used to combine with a flood consequences map to develop a reliable flood risk assessment map for the study area. The final flood risk map can provide a useful source for better flood hazard management of the study area, and the proposed framework and models can be applied to other flood-prone areas.

Rapid development of unplanned infrastructural conveniences and unplanned anthropogenic activities, the frequency and intensity of floods have been accelerated in recent years. Therefore, flood susceptibility analysis is considered as an important flood management approach. Identification of flood susceptibility areas has been performed by applying advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) at the lower part of Raidak river basin. The flood susceptibility maps have been generated based on 14 different flood conditioning factors. Models are evaluated in a conventional way using ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve. The AUC value of ROC is above 0.80 for all models and XGBoost depicts the highest efficacy (AUC â= â0.92). Friedman test and Wilcoxon Signed rank test have been used to measure the statistical variances among the applied models. Models proficiently show that the upper part of Raidak river basin is a less flood probable region whereas the eastern and some middle parts have high flood probability. Around 27% area (285.39 sq.km) within the river basin is highly flood prone (based on XGBoost model) due to the fast changing dynamic landscape and large scale human intervention.

Statistical metrics include sensitivity, specificity accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC) were used to assess the validity of the proposed model. The result shows that the proposed model has the highest goodness-of-fit (AUC = 0.989) and prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.985), and based on the validation dataset it outperforms benchmark models including LR (0.885), LMT (0.934), BLR (0.936), ADT (0.976), NBT (0.974), REPTree (0.811), ANFIS-BAT (0.944), ANFIS-CA (0.921), ANFIS-IWO (0.939), ANFIS-ICA (0.947), and ANFIS-FA (0.917). We conclude that the DBPGA model is an excellent alternative tool for predicting flash flood susceptibility for other regions prone to flash floods.

Accurate assessment of the flood susceptibility mapping is crucial in sustainable development. It helps respective authorities to prevent as much as possible their irreversible consequences. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) spatial resolution is one of the most crucial base layer factors for modeling Flood Probability Maps (FPMs). Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the influence of the spatial resolution of the DEMs 12.5 m (ALOS PALSAR) and 30 m (ASTER) on the accuracy of flood probability prediction using three machine learning models (MLMs), including Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Generalized Linear Model (GLM). This study selected 14 causative factors in the flood as independent variables, and 220 flood locations were selected as dependent variables. Dependent variables were divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) for flood susceptibility modeling. The Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), Kappa index, accuracy, and other statistical criteria were used to evaluate the models' accuracy. The results showed that resolving the DEM alone cannot significantly affect the accuracy of flood probability prediction regardless of the applied MLM and independently of the statistical model used to assess the performance accuracy. In contrast, the factors such as altitude, precipitation, and distance from the river have a considerable impact on floods in this region. Also, the evaluation results of the models showed that the RF (AUC12.5,30m = 0.983, 0.975) model is more accurate in preparing the FPM than the ANN (AUC12.5,30m = 0.949, 0.93) and GLM (AUC12.5,30m = 0.965, 0.949) models. This study's solution-oriented findings might help water managers and decision-makers to make the most effective adaptation and mitigation measures against potential flooding.

As a result, Flood Susceptibility Maps (FSMs) became vital for flood prevention, risk mitigation, and decision-making. The purpose of this study is to develop FSMs for Adana province on the Mediterranean coast of TÃ¼rkiye using tree-based machine learning (ML) classifiers. This study seeks to analyze the predictive performance of Natural Gradient Boosting Machines (NGBoost) for the first time in FSM studies, as well as the first comparative study of Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM) and CatBoost versus other techniques, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost). These ML approaches were evaluated using fourteen flood conditioning parameters divided into five categories: topographical, meteorological, vegetation, lithological, and anthropogenic. The AdaBoost and LightGBM models scored the highest in terms of test accuracy (0.8978), followed by GB and NGBoost (0.8832), XGBoost (0.8759), RF (0.8613), and CatBoost (0.8102). A McNemar's test was used to determine the statistical significance of classifier predictions. According to the FSMs generated, Adana province has a substantial quantity of land that is moderately to extremely prone to flooding. For feature selection, the majority of previous studies used solely the Information Gain (IG) method and multicollinearity analysis. However, only a few studies used global explanatory models to calculate the relevance of their conditioning factors. A locally explained model is required to understand the associations and dependencies between each conditioning factor. Therefore, this study locally explains the generated ML-based FSMs with the help of an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach, namely SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). According to the findings, elevation, slope, and distance to rivers are the top three contributing factors in most models. SHAP results show that lower elevations, lower slopes, areas closer to river banks, agricultural areas, and sparsely vegetated areas are shown to be more prone to flooding.

To this end, this study evaluated the flood susceptibility using a neural network model depending on a flood inundation map created from satellite data from 2010 to 2020, and explanatory factors for flood inundation selected by Geodetector and regularized random forest. Subsequently, the landscape pattern of the coastal city was quantified based on the land cover, and key landscape pattern metrics for flood susceptibility were selected at patch and class levels using statistical approaches. Eventually, urban spatial planning strategies for flood management were proposed based on the ecological significance of key metrics. Taking Xiamen as a case study, the flood susceptibility map showed that flood-prone areas in Xiamen are mainly distributed along river banks and coastlines. Key landscape pattern metrics for flood susceptibility selected by statistical approaches showed that patch-level metrics account for more explanatory power than class-level metrics, and the classes of the landscape would affect the role of patch-level metrics. Overall, the division index of the forest, the connectance index of water, the number of core areas and the fractal dimension index of urban, and the Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance of urban and water are significantly positively related to flood susceptibility, while the core area and the proximity index of urban, the similarity index, the core area index, and the edge contrast index of the forest, and the contiguity index of forest, grass, farmland, and shrub negatively related with flood susceptibility. Based on these findings, intensive urban planning and integrative Nature-based Solutions networks should be considered as strategies for enhancing coastal flood resilience.

It is interesting to see whether RNB could optimize NB and achieve satisfied assessment results like RF in the flood susceptibility assessment study. RNB has rarely been used in study of using machine learning methods to spatially analyze natural disasters, and thus it was selected as the analysis method. Based on the data feasibility, 12 spatial factors that affect the occurrence and spatial distribution of floods were selected. To avoid the influence of subjective equal-interval classification method, natural breaks and quantile method were used to discretize factors with continuous values, respectively. Here, a recently proposed repeatedly random sampling method was adopted to select negative samples for RNB to generate a most accurate classifier (MAC) that was employed to compute the probability of flood occurrence in the study area. Consequently, this paper adopted the integrated framework of GIS and RNB to spatially assess the flood susceptibility using the Wanan County in China as an instance. The results demonstrated that when integrated with the repeatedly random sampling method, the MAC-based flood susceptibility maps corresponding to different factor discretization methods were similar, meaning this framework can effectively avoid the effects caused by different factor discretization methods. Also, to testify the classification performance of RNB, RF and NB were chosen to compare the classification performance with it. The results indicated the classification performance in the order of RF > RNB > NB. This means RNB is able to achieve better classification performance than NB, but it exists limitations when compared with traditional strong classifiers like RF. The findings of this paper proved that RNB is a feasible approach for natural hazard susceptibility assessment.

In this study, a flood risk map was produced for Kermanshah city (Iran) by combining flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. Based on effective factors of urban flooding, flood hazard maps were generated using two machine learning models: Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP). These models were developed on 117 flood sites which were identified on the reports and field surveys for Kermanshah city, and 163 non-flooded points. Economic, social, and infrastructure criteria were considered to analyze flood vulnerability. The sub-criteria were defined based on social and cultural structure in developing countries and urban infrastructure facilities involved in the floods. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process method (FAHP) was applied to determine the overall weight vector. The results demonstrated that the MaxEnt model had a better performance than the GARP model based on two common indices which are the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC = 96.76â98.32%) and kappa statistic (Kappa = 0.82-0.86). These findings showed that machine learning models provide reliable results for areas where data access is challenging, especially in developing countries. The results also indicated that infrastructure criterion has the highest impact weight on the vulnerability. In general, population, urban texture, and distance to the major drainage channels are the most important factors in increasing flood risk. Also, the vulnerability of an urban neighborhood greatly increases the risk of flooding.

This study describes the potential application of two architectures of deep learning neural networks, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), for spatially explicit prediction and mapping of flash flood probability. To develop and validate the predictive models, a geospatial database that contained records for the historical flood events and geo-environmental characteristics of the Golestan Province in northern Iran was constructed. The step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) was employed to investigate the spatial interplay between floods and different influencing factors. The CNN and RNN models were trained using the SWARA weights and validated using the receiver operating characteristics technique. The results showed that the CNN model (AUC = 0.832, RMSE = 0.144) performed slightly better than the RNN model (AUC = 0.814, RMSE = 0.181) in predicting future floods. Further, these models demonstrated an improved prediction of floods compared to previous studies that used different models in the same study area. This study showed that the spatially explicit deep learning neural network models are successful in capturing the heterogeneity of spatial patterns of flood probability in the Golestan Province, and the resulting probability maps can be used for the development of mitigation plans in response to the future floods.

In this study, we proposed and validated three ensemble models based on the Best First Decision Tree (BFT) and the Bagging (Bagging-BFT), Decorate (Bagging-BFT), and Random Subspace (RSS-BFT) ensemble learning techniques for an improved prediction of flood susceptibility in a spatially-explicit manner. A total number of 126 historical flood events from the Nghe An Province (Vietnam) were connected to a set of 10 flood influencing factors (slope, elevation, aspect, curvature, river density, distance from rivers, flow direction, geology, soil, and land use) for generating the training and validation datasets. The models were validated via several performance metrics that demonstrated the capability of all three ensemble models in elucidating the underlying pattern of flood occurrences within the research area and predicting the probability of future flood events. Based on the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), the ensemble Decorate-BFT model that achieved an AUC value of 0.989 was identified as the superior model over the RSS-BFT (AUC = 0.982) and Bagging-BFT (AUC = 0.967) models. A comparison between the performance of the models and the models previously reported in the literature confirmed that our ensemble models provided a reliable estimate of flood susceptibilities and their resulting susceptibility maps are trustful for flood early warning systems as well as development of mitigation plans.

Recently, the combination of data-driven techniques with remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS) has been widely used by researchers for flood susceptibility mapping. This study presents a novel hybrid model combining the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and autoencoder models to produce the susceptibility maps for two study areas located in Iran and India. For two cases, nine, and twelve factors were considered as the predictor variables for flood susceptibility mapping, respectively. The prediction capability of the proposed hybrid model was compared with that of the traditional MLP model through the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) criterion. The AUROC curve for the MLP and autoencoder-MLP models were, respectively, 75 and 90, 74 and 93% in the training phase and 60 and 91, 81 and 97% in the testing phase, for Iran and India cases, respectively. The results suggested that the hybrid autoencoder-MLP model outperformed the MLP model and, therefore, can be used as a powerful model in other studies for flood susceptibility mapping.

The objective of this study is to develop flood susceptibility maps for the Idukki district making use of Remote Sensing (RS) data, Geographic Information System (GIS), and Machine Learning (ML). In this study, five different ML models (Adaboost, Gradient boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), CatBoost, Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB)) are evaluated to determine flood susceptibility in Idukki district Kerala. There were a total of sixteen hydrometeorological parameters taken into account. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of various techniques in terms of both prediction and success rates. The validation results proved the efficiency of the individual techniques. The highest AUC was obtained by the SGB and GBC (92%), followed by that of the Adaboost with AUC 87%, and the lowest AUC was obtained by CatBoost, with AUC of 79%. The absence of data overfitting in all models demonstrates the efficacy of boosting techniques. The boosting algorithms penalize models that overfit the training set, which helps to decrease overfitting. Researchers and local governments could benefit from the proposed boosting techniques in the flood susceptibility mapping and mitigation strategies.

Remote sensing imagery provides a means for timely monitoring of rapidly changing water bodies during flooding events; but manual analysis of remote sensing (RS) images however, is labor intensive and time consuming. Automated methods are effective, but the post-classification comparison method for flood inundation detection is subject to error accumulation, and the direct change detection method is limited by the accuracy of flood mapping and the difficulty of obtaining training samples. To overcome these challenges, a flood inundation detection network (Siam-DWENet) that achieves high-accuracy inundation detection is proposed. In Siam-DWENet, an innovative cross-task transfer learning strategy incorporates an attention mechanism and multi-scale pyramid structure based on Siamese architectures. This approach realizes a priori knowledge transfer-based flood inundation detection with a limited number of training samples. Comparative experiments on Siam-DWENet and other methods using two flooding SAR datasets to evaluate the accuracy of flood detection. The experimental results indicate that Siam-DWENet outperforms other change detection methods and makes the inundation area edge more accurate when dealing with complex backgrounds, achieving an average OA of 0.887 and F1 of 0.865 in flood inundation detection tasks.

We show that regression models based on Attention U-Net and LinkNet architectures trained on such synthetic data can predict the maximum water level and topographic deformation from a remote sensing-derived change detection map and a digital elevation model. The proposed framework has an inpainting capability, thus mitigating the false negatives that are inevitable in remote sensing image analysis. Our framework breaks limits of remote sensing and enables rapid estimation of inundation depth and topographic deformation, essential information for emergency response, including rescue and relief activities.

Our work aims to propose a state-of-the-art model for susceptibility mapping of the flash flood using the decision tree random subspace ensemble optimized by hybrid firefly-particle swarm optimization (HFPS), namely the HFPS-RSTree model. In this work, we used data from a flood inventory map consisting of 1866 polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and a field survey conducted in the northwest mountainous area of the Van Ban district, Lao Cai Province in Vietnam. A total of eleven flooding conditioning factors (soil type, geology, rainfall, river density, elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), plant curvature, and profile curvature) were used as explanatory variables. These indicators were compiled from a geological and mineral resources map, soil type map, and topographic map, ALOS PALSAR DEM 30 m, and Landsat-8 imagery. The HFPS-RSTree model was trained and verified using the inventory map and the eleven conditioning variables and then compared with four machine learning algorithms, i.e., the support vector machine (SVM), the random forests (RF), the C4.5 decision trees (C4.5 DT), and the logistic model trees (LMT) models. We employed a range of statistical standard metrics to assess the predictive performance of the proposed model. The results show that the HFPS-RSTree model had the best predictive performance and achieved better results than those of other benchmarks with the ability to predict flash flood, reaching an overall accuracy of over 90%. It can be concluded that the proposed approach provides new insights into flash flood prediction in mountainous regions.

Many protocols that form the Internet infrastructure expose a set of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to carry out a set of attacks. DNS, one of the most critical elements of the Internet, is among these protocols. It is vulnerable to DDoS attacks mainly because all exchanges in this protocol use User Datagram Protocol (UDP). These attacks are difficult to defeat because attackers spoof the IP address of the victim and flood him with valid DNS responses coming from legitimate DNS servers. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable solution, called WisdomSDN, to effectively mitigate DNS amplification attack in the context of software defined networks (SDN). WisdomSDN covers both detection and mitigation of illegitimate DNS requests and responses. WisdomSDN consists of: (1) a novel proactive and stateful scheme (PAS) to perform one-to-one mapping between DNS requests and DNS responses; it operates proactively by sending only legitimate responses, excluding amplified illegitimate DNS responses; (2) a machine learning DDoS detection module to detect, in real-time, illegitimate DNS requests. This module consists of (a) Flow statistics collection scheme (FSC) to gather the features of flows in an efficient and scalable way using sFlow protocol; (b) Entropy calculation scheme (ECS) to measure randomness of network traffic; and (c) Bayes Network based Filtering scheme (BNF) to classify, based on entropy values, illegitimate DNS requests; and (3) DNS Mitigation scheme (DM) to effectively mitigate illegitimate DNS requests. The experimental results show that, compared to state-of-art, WisdomSDN can effectively detect/mitigate DNS amplification attack quickly with high detection rate, less false positive rate, and low overhead making it a promising solution to mitigate DNS amplification attack in a SDN environment.

Here, we use a machine learning algorithm and historical weather data to upscale sparse in situ river discharge measurements. We provide a global reanalysis of monthly runoff rates for periods covering decades to the past century at a resolution of 0.5 degrees (about 55 km), and with up to 525 ensemble members based on 21 different atmospheric forcing data sets. This global runoff reconstruction, named Global RUNoff ENSEMBLE (G-RUN ENSEMBLE), is evaluated using independent observations from large river basins and benchmarked against other publicly available runoff data sets over the period 1981-2010. The accuracy of the data set is evaluated on observed river flow from basins not used for model calibration and is found to compare favorably against state-of-the-art global hydrological model simulations. The G-RUN ENSEMBLE estimates the global mean runoff volume to range between 3.2 x 10(4) and 3.8 x 10(4) km(3) yr(-1). This publicly available data set (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12794075) has a wide range of applications, including regional water resources assessments, climate change attribution studies, hydro-climatic process studies as well as the evaluation, calibration and refinement of global hydrological models.

The objective of the current work is to employ four data mining/machine learning models to generate flood susceptibility maps, namely boosted regression tree (BRT), functional data analysis (FDA), general linear model (GLM), and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA). This study was done in Wadi Qena Basin in Egypt. Flood inundated locations were determined and extracted from the interpretation of different datasets, including high-resolution satellite images (sentinel-2 and Astro digital) (after flood events), historical records, and intensive field works. In total, 342 flood inundated locations were mapped using ArcGIS 10.5, which separated into two groups; training (has 239 flood locations represents 70%) and validating (has 103 flood locations represents 30%), respectively. Nine themes of flood-influencing factors were prepared, including slope-angle, slope length, altitude, distance from main wadis, landuse/landcover, lithological units, curvature, slope-aspect, and topographic wetness index. The relationships between the flood-influencing factors and the flood inventory map were evaluated using the mentioned models (BRT, FDA, GLM, and MDA). The results were compared with flood inundating locations (validating flood sites), which were not used in constructing the models. The accuracy of the models was calculated through the success (training data) and prediction (validation data) rate curves according to the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). The results showed that the AUC for success and prediction rates are 0.783, 0.958, 0.816, 0.821 and 0.812, 0.856, 0.862, 0.769 for BRT, FDA, GLM, and MDA models, respectively. Subsequently, flood susceptibility maps were divided into five classes, including very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The results revealed that the BRT, FDA, GLM, and MDA models provide reasonable accuracy in flood susceptibility mapping.

Weather conditions continue to grow more extreme, and wildfires are occurring quite frequently and are spreading with greater intensity. Wildfires ravage forest areas, as recently seen in the Amazon, the United States, and more recently in Australia. The availability of remotely sensed data has vastly improved, and enables us to precisely locate wildfires for monitoring purposes. Wildfire inventory data was created by integrating the polygons collected through field surveys using global positioning systems (GPS) and the data collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) thermal anomalies product between 2012 and 2017 for the study area. The inventory data, along with sixteen conditioning factors selected for the study area, was used to appraise the potential of various machine learning (ML) methods for wildfire susceptibility mapping in Amol County. The ML methods chosen for this study are artificial neural network (ANN), dmine regression (DR), DM neural, least angle regression (LARS), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), radial basis function (RBF), self-organizing maps (SOM), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT), along with the statistical approach of logistic regression (LR), which is very apt for wildfire susceptibility studies. The wildfire inventory data was categorized as three-fold, with 66% being used for training the models and 33% being used for accuracy assessment within three-fold cross-validation (CV). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was used to assess the accuracy of the ML approaches. RF had the highest accuracy of 88%, followed by SVM with an accuracy of almost 79%, and LR had the lowest accuracy of 65%. This shows that RF is better suited for wildfire susceptibility assessments in our case study area.

In this paper, time-series satellite images are used to predict urban expansion. As the ground truth is not available in time-series satellite images, an unsupervised image segmentation method based on deep learning is used to generate the ground truth for training and validation. The automated annotated images are then manually validated using Google Maps to generate the ground truth. The remaining data were then manually annotated. Prediction of urban expansion is achieved by using a ConvLSTM network, which can learn the global spatio-temporal information without shrinking the size of spatial feature maps. The ConvLSTM based model is applied on the time-series satellite images and the results of prediction are compared with Pix2pix and Dual GAN networks. In this paper, experimental results are conducted using several multi-date satellite images representing the three largest cities in Saudi Arabia, namely: Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. The evaluation results show that the proposed ConvLSTM based model produced better prediction results in terms of Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Error, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index, and overall classification accuracy as compared to Pix2pix and Dual GAN.

The importance of each input parameter on flood occurrences was assessed via the Mutual Information (MI) technique. Several machine learning models, including Radial Basis Function (RBF), and three hybrid models of Bagging (BA-RBF), Random Committee (RC-RBF), and Random Subspace (RSS-RBF), were developed to delineate flood susceptibility areas at Goorganrood watershed, Iran. The performance of each model was evaluated using several error indicators, including correlation coefficient (r), Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC). The results showed that the hybrid techniques enhanced the modeling performance of the standalone model, and generally, all hybrid models are more accurate than the standalone model.

At the same time, SDNs constitute an attractive target for cyber attackers due to their global network view and programmability. One of the major vulnerabilities of typical SDN architectures is their susceptibility to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attacks. DDoS flooding attacks can render SDN controllers unavailable to their underlying infrastructure, causing service disruption or a complete outage in many cases. In this paper, machine learning-based detection and classification of DDoS flooding attacks on SDNs is investigated using popular machine learning (ML) algorithms. The ML algorithms, classifiers and methods investigated are quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes (GNB), k -nearest neighbor (k-NN), and classification and regression tree (CART). The general principle is illustrated through a case study, in which, experimental data (i.e. jitter, throughput, and response time metrics) from a representative SDN architecture suitable for typical mid-sized enterprise-wide networks is used to build classification models that accurately identify and classify DDoS flooding attacks. The SDN model used was emulated in Mininet and the DDoS flooding attacks (i.e. hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), transmission control protocol (TCP), and user datagram protocol (UDP) attacks) have been launched on the SDN model using low orbit ion cannon (LOIC). Although all the ML methods investigated show very good efficacy in detecting and classifying DDoS flooding attacks, CART demonstrated the best performance on average in terms of prediction accuracy (98%), prediction speed ( 5.3,,{times },,10{5} observations per second), training time (12.4 ms), and robustness.

Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment.

A total of 2769 records were collected from flood locations across the entire country; we divided this data set into two groups using a cross-validation technique. The first group, used as a training data set, was constructed from 70% of the data set and was used for model building. The second group, used as a testing data set, was constructed from the remaining 30% of the records and used for validation. Ten flood conditioning factors, slope, altitude, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, rainfall, geology, land use, distance from roads, and distance from rivers, were identified and used in the modeling process. The area under the prediction-rate curve was used for model evaluation, with results showing that the flood susceptibility map has an acceptable accuracy of 75%. The results also indicated that approximately 12% and 3% of the country are highly and very highly susceptible to future flooding events, respectively. Moreover, 29% and 49% of Iran's cities are located in areas with high and very high susceptibility to future flooding hazards. The most effective approaches to flood mitigation are preventing urban expansion and new construction in highly to very highly flood-prone areas as well as watershed management plans and constructing flood control structures according to the topographical characteristics of the catchment.

Here, we use machine learning to remove buildings and forests from the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model to produce, for the first time, a global map of elevation with buildings and forests removed at 1 arc second (?30 m) grid spacing. We train our correction algorithm on a unique set of reference elevation data from 12 countries, covering a wide range of climate zones and urban extents. Hence, this approach has much wider applicability compared to previous DEMs trained on data from a single country. Our method reduces mean absolute vertical error in built-up areas from 1.61 to 1.12 m, and in forests from 5.15 to 2.88 m. The new elevation map is more accurate than existing global elevation maps and will strengthen applications and models where high quality global terrain information is required.

Reducing the outputs obtained after each modelling analysis is key to present the results for stakeholders, land managers and policymakers. So, the main goal of this survey was to present a method to synthesize three natural hazards in one multi-hazard map and its evaluation for hazard management and land use planning. To test this methodology, we took as study area the Gorganrood Watershed, located in the Golestan Province (Iran). First, an inventory map of three different types of hazards including flood, landslides, and gullies was prepared using field surveys and different official reports. To generate the susceptibility maps, a total of 17 geo-environmental factors were selected as predictors using the MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) machine learning technique. The accuracy of the predictive models was evaluated by drawing receiver operating characteristic-ROC curves and calculating the area under the ROC curve-AUCROC. The MaxEnt model not only implemented superbly in the degree of fitting, but also obtained significant results in predictive performance. Variables importance of the three studied types of hazards showed that river density, distance from streams, and elevation were the most important factors for flood, respectively. Lithological units, elevation, and annual mean rainfall were relevant for detecting landslides. On the other hand, annual mean rainfall, elevation, and lithological units were used for gully erosion mapping in this study area. Finally, by combining the flood, landslides, and gully erosion susceptibility maps, an integrated multi-hazard map was created. The results demonstrated that 60% of the area is subjected to hazards, reaching a proportion of landslides up to 21.2% in the whole territory. We conclude that using this type of multi-hazard map may be a useful tool for local administrators to identify areas susceptible to hazards at large scales as we demonstrated in this research.

This study evaluated the capability of convolutional neural network (NNETC) and recurrent neural network (NNETR) models for flood hazard mapping. A flood-inundation inventory (including 295 flooded sites) was used as the response variable and 10 flood-affecting factors were considered as the predictor variables. Flooded sites were then spatially randomly split in a 70:30 ratio for building flood models and for validation purposes. The prediction quality of the models was validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and root mean square error (RMSE). The validation results indicated that prediction performance of the NNETC model (AUC = 84%, RMSE = 0.163) was slightly better than that of the NNETR model (AUC = 82%, RMSE = 0.186). Both models indicated that terrain ruggedness index was the most important predictor, followed by slope and elevation. Although the model output had a relative error of up to 20% (based on AUC), this modeling approach could still be used as a reliable and rapid tool to generate a flood hazard map for urban areas, provided that a flood inundation inventory is available.

In this paper, we evaluate flood riskin Jiroft city, Iran, using a combination of machine learning and decision-making methods. Flood hazard maps were created using three state-of-the-art machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and boosted regression tree). The metadata supporting our analysis comprises 218 flood inundation points and a variety of derived factors: slope aspect, elevation, slope angle, rainfall, distance to streets, distance to rivers, land use/land cover, distance to urban drainages, urban drainage density, and curve number. We then employed the TOPSIS decision-making tool for urban flood vulnerability analysis, which is based on socio-economic factors such as building density, population density, building history, and socio-economic conditions. Finally, we derived an urban flood risk map for Jiroft based on flood hazard and vulnerability maps. Of the three models tested, the random forest model yielded the most accurate map. The results indicate that urban drainage density and distance to urban drainages are the most important factors in urban flood hazard modeling. As might be expected, areas with a high or very high population density are most vulnerable to flooding. These results show that flood risk mapping provide insights for priority planning in flood risk management, especially in areas with limited hydrological data.

In the first step, flood susceptibility maps were developed using machine learning models (MLMs), including: LevenbergâMarquardt back propagation (LM-BP) neural network and decision trees (DT) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. Performance of the MLMs and MCDM techniques were assessed considering the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Mathematical approaches in a geographic information system (GIS) for four well-known LAM problems affecting emergency rescue time are proposed: maximal covering location problem (MCLP), the maximize attendance (MA), p-median problem (PMP), and the location set covering problem (LSCP). The results showed that existing EECs were not optimally distributed, and that some areas were not adequately served by EECs (i.e., not all demand points could be reached within a 60-min travel time). We concluded that the proposed models can be used to improve planning of the distribution of EECs, and that application of the models could contribute to reducing human casualties, property losses, and improve emergency operation.

The purpose of the proposed research is to analyze flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) in the Sulaymaniyah province of Iraq. This study employed a genetic algorithm (GA) to fine-tune parallel ensemble-based machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF) and bootstrap aggregation (Bagging)). Four machine learning algorithms (RF, Bagging, RF-GA, and Bagging-GA) were used to build FSM in the study area. To provide inputs into parallel ensemble-based machine learning algorithms, we gathered and processed data from meteorological (Rainfall), satellite image (flood inventory, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), aspect, land cover, altitude, stream power index (SPI), plan curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), slope) and geographic sources (geology). For this research, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images were utilized to locate flooded areas and create an inventory map of floods. To train and validate the model, we employed 70 % and 30 % of 160 selected flood locations, respectively. Multicollinearity, frequency ratio (FR), and Geodetector methods were used for data preprocessing. Four metrics were utilized to assess the FSM performance: the root mean square error (RMSE), the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), the Taylor diagram, and the seed cell area index (SCAI). The results exhibited that all the suggested models have high accuracy of prediction, but the performance of Bagging-GA (RMSE (Train = 0.1793, Test = 0.4543)) was slightly better than RF-GA (RMSE (Train = 0.1803, Test = 0.4563)), Bagging (RMSE (Train = 0.2191, Test = 0.4566)), and RF (RMSE (Train = 0.2529, Test = 0.4724)). According to the ROC index, the Bagging-GA model (AUC = 0.935) was the most accurate in flood susceptibility modeling, followed by the RF-GA (AUC = 0.904), the Bagging (AUC = 0.872), and the RF (AUC = 0.847) models.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the comparative utility of six machine learning algorithms to improve flood susceptibility and ensemble techniques' capability to elucidate the underlying patterns of floods and make a more accurate prediction of flood susceptibilities in the Pagla river basin. In the present scenario, the frequency of flood conditions in this study area becomes high with heavy and sudden rainfall, so it is essential to study flood mitigation and measure. At first, a spatial flood database was built with 200 flood locations and sixteen flood influencing factors, and its process with the help of the Geographic Information System (GIS) environment and build up different models applying the machine learning techniques. It has found different flood susceptibility zone using machine learning-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree), Logistic Regression (LR), and Bagging helping GIS environment and the model validation using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve. Afterward, ensemble all the models to gate comparative accuracy of the flood zone.

The spatial patterns of flood susceptibility were assessed in this study using six applied machine learning (ML) models including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). A flood inventory map was provided using 180 flood points and 180 non-flood points. Both flood and non-flood locations were randomly partitioned into training and testing datasets with the ratio of 70:30. Sixteen various meteorological, hydrological, and geospatial variables were considered in the flood susceptibility assessment. The multi-collinearity analysis was performed to measure the intensity of correlations between the variables and determine whether factors can be included in the flood susceptibility assessment. From a total of sixteen variables, thirteen were chosen based on the multi-collinearity study. The five statistical indices Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC), Jaccard index, F1 score, Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa coefficient (K) were used to evaluate modelsâ performance. Regarding the results of accuracy criteria, the RF model had the best predictive potential. Flood conditioning factors were reclassified using Quantile classification method and the importance of each class from a given flood conditioning factor was evaluated using the Frequency Ratio (FR) method. Additionally, the spatial relationship between the flood conditioning factors and the flood susceptibility map was investigated using the correlation matrix based on the Spearman correlation analysis. Findings of the correlation matrix revealed that the most important flood conditioning factors, in order of importance, were lithology, drainage density, distance from rivers, soil, rainfall, land cover, and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). The flood susceptibility map, as the principal output of this study, was produced in five classes ranging from very low to very high susceptibility. The flood susceptibility map provided using the RF model (i.e., the model with the highest accuracy) indicated that the flood susceptibility is very high in 19.73% of the study area, high in 15.49%, moderate in 16.15%, low in 18.72%, and very low in 29.91%. Findings of this research might be an invaluable resource for better management of flooding since it specifically emphasized the primary causes of flooding as well as locations of heightened flood susceptibility.

The glaciers are melting faster than expected which has resulted in global mean sea level rise and increased the risk of floods. The development of modern remote sensing technology has made it possible to obtain images more frequently than ever before. On the other side, the availability of high-performance computing hardware and processing techniques have made it possible to provide a cost-effective solution to monitor the temporal changes of glaciers at a large scale. In this study, supervised machine learning methods are investigated for automatic classification of glacier covers from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery using texture, topographic, and spectral data. Three most commonly used supervised machine learning techniques were investigated: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF). The proposed method was employed on the data obtained from Passu watershed in Hunza Basin located along the Hunza river in Pakistan. Three main classes were considered: glaciers, debris-covered glaciers and non-glaciated areas. The data was split into training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Finally, an area-based accuracy assessment was performed by comparing the results obtained for each classifier with the reference data. Experiments showed that the results produced for all classifiers were highly accurate and visually more consistent with the depiction of glacier cover types. For all experiments, random forest performed the best (Kappa = 0.95, f-measure = 95.06%) on all three classes compared to ANN (Kappa = 0.92, f-measure = 92.05) and SVM (Kappa = 0.89, f-measure = 91.86% on average). The high classification accuracy obtained to distinguished debris-covered glaciers using our approach will be useful to determine the actual available water resources which can be further helpful for hazard and water resource management.

The country experiences multi-type floods (i.e., fluvial, flash, pluvial, and surge floods) every year. However, areas prone to multi-type floods have not yet been assessed on a national scale. Here, we used locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), random subspace (RSS), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), random forest (RF), and M5P model tree algorithms in a hybrid ensemble to assess multi-type flood probabilities at a national scale in Bangladesh. We used historical flood data (1988â2020), remote sensing images (e.g., MODIS, Landsat 5â8, and Sentinel-1), and topography, hydrogeology, and environmental datasets to train and validate the proposed algorithms. According to the results, the stacking ensemble machine learning LWLR-RF algorithm performed better than the other algorithms in predicting flood probabilities, with R2 = 0.967â0.999, MAE = 0.022â0.117, RMSE = 0.029â0.148, RAE = 4.48â23.38%, and RRSE = 5.8829.69% for the training and testing datasets.

Onboard processing offers a solution to decrease the amount of data to transmit by reducing large sensor images to smaller data products. The ESAâs recent PhiSat-1 mission aims to facilitate the demonstration of this concept, providing the hardware capability to perform onboard processing by including a power-constrained machine learning accelerator and the software to run custom applications.

Consequently, landslide risk assessment has become requisite for managing the resources in future. This study was designed to develop four ensemble metaheuristic machine learning algorithms, such as grey wolf optimized based artificial neural network (GW-ANN), grey wolf optimized based random forest (GW-RF), particle swarm optimization optimized based ANN (PSO-ANN), and PSO optimized based RF for modeling rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility (LS) in Aqabat Al-Sulbat, Asir region, Saudi Arabia, which observes landslide frequently. To obtain very high precision and robust prediction from machine learning algorithms, the grey wolf and PSO optimization algorithms were integrated to develop new ensemble machine learning techniques. Subsequently, LS maps produced by training dataset were validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve based on the testing dataset. Based on the area under curve (AUC) value of ROC curve, the best method for LS modeling was selected. We developed ROC curve-based sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of the parameters for LS modeling. The Gumble extreme value distribution was employed to estimate the rainfall at 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 year return periods. Then, the landslide hazard maps were prepared at different return periods by integrating the best LS model and estimated rainfall at different return periods. The theory of danger pixels was employed to prepare a final risk assessment of the resources, which have been exposed to the landslide. The results showed that 27â42 and 6â15 km2 were predicted as the very high and high LS zones using four ensemble metaheuristic machine learning algorithms. Based on the area under curve (AUC) of ROC, GR-ANN (AUC-0.905) appeared as the best model for LS modeling. The areas under high and very high landslide hazard were gradually increased over the progression of time (26 km2 at the 2 year return period and 40 km2 at the 100 year return period for the high landslide hazard zone, and 6 km2 at the 2 year return period and 20 km2 at the 100 year return period for the very high landslide hazard zone). Similarly, the areas of danger pixel also increased gradually from the 2 to 100 year return periods (37 km2 to 62 km2 ). Various natural resources, such as scrubland, built up, and sparse vegetation, were identified under risk zone due to landslide hazards. In addition, these resources would be exposed extensively to landslides over the advancement of return periods. Therefore, the outcome of the present study will help planners and scientists to propose high precision management plans for protecting natural resources, which have been exposed to landslides.

The more than satisfactory results allowed an estimation of peak deforestation rates for the period 2000- 2006; for the period 2006-2015, a significant decrease and stabilization, followed by a slight increase till 2019. Based on the derived trends a forest dynamics was simulated for the period 2019-2028, estimating a decrease in the deforestation rate. These results demonstrate that such a fusion of satellite observations, machine learning, and cloud processing, benefits the analysis of the forest dynamics and can provide useful information for the development of forest policies.

Much remote sensing flood analysis is semi-automated, with time consuming manual components requiring hours to complete. In this study, we present a fully automated approach to the rapid flood mapping currently carried out by many non-governmental, national and international organisations. We design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method which isolates the flooded pixels in freely available Copernicus Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, requiring no optical bands and minimal pre-processing. We test a variety of CNN architectures and train our models on flood masks generated using a combination of classical semi-automated techniques and extensive manual cleaning and visual inspection. Our methodology reduces the time required to develop a flood map by 80%, while achieving strong performance over a wide range of locations and environmental conditions. Given the open-source data and the minimal image cleaning required, this methodology can also be integrated into end-to-end pipelines for more timely and continuous flood monitoring.

Land use and land cover maps prepared using satellite remote sensing techniques in conjunction with landform-soil-vegetation relationships and ground truth are popular for locating suitable sites for the construction of water harvesting structures, soil and water conservation measures, runoff computations, irrigation planning and agricultural management, analyzing socio-ecological concerns, flood controlling, and overall watershed management. Here we use a novel approach to analyze Sentinelâ2 multispectral satellite data using traditional and principal component analysis based approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of maximum likelihood estimation, random forest tree, and support vector machine classifiers to improve land use and land cover categorization for Soil Conservation Service Curve Number model. Additionally, we use stratified random sampling to evaluate the accuracies of resulted land use and land cover maps in terms of kappa coefficient, overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy. The classifiers were used for classifying the data into seven major land use and land cover classes namely water, built-up, mixed forest, cultivated land, barren land, fallow land with vertisols dominance, and fallow land with inceptisols dominance for the Vishwamitri watershed. We find that principal component analysis with support vector machine is able to produce highly accurate land use and land cover classified maps. Principal component analysis extracts the useful spectral information by compressing redundant data embedded in each spectral channel. The study highlights the use of principal component analysis with support vector machine classifier to improve land use and land cover classification from which policymakers can make better decisions and extract basic information for policy amendments.

Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM), mostly based on statistical and machine learning methods, has been widely employed to mitigate flood risk; however, they neglect exposure and vulnerability assessment as the key components of flood risk. Flood risk assessment is often conducted by quantitative methods (e.g., probabilistic). Such assessment uses analytical and empirical techniques to construct the physical vulnerability curves of elements at risk, but the role of people's capacity, depending on social vulnerability, remains limited. To address this gap, this study developed a semiquantitative method, based on the spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). The model combines two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, and factors triggering coastal flooding in Bandar Abbas, Iran. It also employs an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model to weight indicators of hazard, exposure, and social vulnerability components. Under the most extreme flooding scenario, 14.8% of flooded areas were identified as high and very high risk, mostly located in eastern, western, and partly in the middle of the City. The results of this study can be employed by decision-makers to apply appropriate risk reduction strategies in high-risk flooding zones.

Inadequate information and awareness of flood hazard make the management of flood risks arduous and challenging. This paper proposes a hybridized analytic approach via unsupervised and supervised learning methodologies, for the discovery of pieces of knowledge, clustering and prediction of flood severity levels (FSL). A two-staged unsupervised learning based on k-means and self-organizing maps (SOM) was performed on the unlabeled flood dataset. K-means based on silhouette criterion discovered top three representatives of the optimal numbers of clusters inherent in the flood dataset. Experts' judgment favored four clusters, while Squared Euclidean distance was the best performing distance measure. SOM provided cluster visuals of the input attributes within the four different groups and transformed the dataset into a labeled one. A 5-layered Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) driven by hybrid learning algorithm was applied to classify and predict FSL. ANFIS optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA) produced root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.323 and Error Standard Deviation of 0.408 while Particle Swarm Optimized ANFIS model produced 0.288 as the RMSE, depicting 11% improvement when compared with GA optimized model.

To do so, 13 conditioning factors influencing the flood occurrence in Brisbane river catchment in Australia (i.e., topographic, water?related, geological, and land use factors) were acquired for further processing and modeling. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANN), deep learning neural networks (DLNN), and optimized DLNN using particle swarm optimization (PSO) were exploited to predict and estimate the susceptible areas to the future floods. The significance of the conditioning factors analysis for the region highlighted that altitude, distance from river, STI, and slope played the most important roles, whereas SPI did not contribute to the hazardous situation. The performance of the models was evaluated against the statistical tests such as sensitivity, specificity, the area under curve (AUC), and true skill statistic (TSS). DLNN and PSO?DLNN models obtained the highest values of sensitivity (0.99) for the training stage to compare with ANN. Moreover, the vali-dations of specificity and TSS for PSO?DLNN recorded the highest values of 0.98 and 0.90, respec-tively, compared with those obtained by ANN and DLNN.

In a first phase, with the help of high-resolution satellite images from the Google Earth application, 481 points affected by torrential processes were acquired, another 481 points being randomly positioned in areas without torrential processes. Seventy percent of the dataset was kept as training data, while the other 30% was assigned to validating sample. Further, in order to train the machine learning models, information regarding the 10 flash-flood predictors was extracted in the training sample locations. Finally, the following four ensembles were used to calculate the Flash-Flood Potential Index across the BÃ¢sca Chiojdului river basin: Deep Learning Neural NetworkâFrequency Ratio (DLNN-FR), Deep Learning Neural NetworkâWeights of Evidence (DLNN-WOE), Alternating Decision TreesâFrequency Ratio (ADT-FR) and Alternating Decision TreesâWeights of Evidence (ADT-WOE).

Thus, in terms of Sensitivity, the highest value of 0.985 was achieved by the DLNN-FR model, meanwhile the lowest one (0.866) was assigned to ADT-FR ensemble. Moreover, the specificity analysis shows that the highest value (0.991) was attributed to DLNN-WOE algorithm, while the lowest value (0.892) was achieved by ADT-FR. During the training procedure, the models achieved overall accuracies between 0.878 (ADT-FR) and 0.985 (DLNN-WOE). K-index shows again that the most performant model was DLNN-WOE (0.97).

In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and data fusion (DF) techniques have emerged as effective alternatives for post-flood mapping and supported current efforts of complex physical and dynamical modeling. Yet, those techniques have not been explored for large-scale (regional) compound flood mapping. Here, we evaluate the performance of a CNN & DF framework for generating CF maps along the southeast Atlantic coast of the U.S. as a result of Hurricane Matthew (October 2016). The framework fuses multispectral imagery from Landsat analysis ready data (ARD), dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar data (SAR), and coastal digital elevation models (DEMs) to produce flood maps at moderate (30 m) spatial resolution. The highest overall accuracy (97%) and f1-scores of permanent water/floodwater (99/100%) are achieved when ARD, SAR and DEM datasets are readily available and fused. Moreover, the resulting CF maps agree well (80%) with hindcast flood guidance maps of the Coastal Emergency Risk Assessment and can effectively match post-flood high water marks of the U.S. Geological Survey distributed in coastal counties. We ultimately evaluate the framework with different DF alternatives and highlight their usefulness for large-scale compound flood mapping as well as calibration of hydrodynamic models. The cost-effective approach proposed here enables efficient estimation of exposure to compound coastal flooding and is particularly useful in data scarce regions.

Study focus: This paper presents the novelty of ANN and HEC-RAS model for flood inundation mapping in lower Baro Akobo Basin River, Ethiopia. ANN and HEC-RAS model is applied and successfully improves the accuracy of prediction and flood inundation in the region. This study uses 14 meteorological stations on a daily basis for 1999?2005 and 2006?2008 periods, and Topographical Wetness Index (TWI) to the train and test the model respectively. The runoff time series obtained in ANN model is linked to HEC-RAS and the flood depths were generated. The flood inundation generated in HEC-RAS model result was calibrated and validated in Normal Difference Water Index (NDWI). New hydrological insights for the region: As the inundation map generated from the runoff values of ANN model reveals, the lower Baro river forms huge inundation depth up to 250 cm. The performance the ANN model was evaluated using Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE = 0.86), PBIAS = 8.2 % and R2 = 0.91 and NSE = 0.88, PBIAS = 8.5 % and R2 = 0.93 during the training and testing periods respectively. The generated inundation areas in HEC-RAS and the water bodies delineated in NDWI were covered with 94.6 % and 96 % as overlapping areas during the calibration and validation periods respectively.

The development of computational ensemble models for improving the predictive accuracy of forest fire susceptibilities could save time and cost in firefighting efforts. Here, we combined a locally weighted learning (LWL) algorithm with the Cascade Generalization (CG), Bagging, Decorate, and Dagging ensemble learning techniques for the prediction of forest fire susceptibility in the Pu Mat National Park, Nghe An Province, Vietnam. A geospatial database that contained records from 56 historical fires and nine explanatory variables was employed to train the standalone LWL model and its derived ensemble models. The models were validated for their goodness-of-fit and predictive capability using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and several other statistical performance criteria. The CG-LWL and Bagging-LWL models with AUC = 0.993 showed the highest training performance, whereas the Dagging-LWL ensemble model with AUC = 0.983 performed better than Decorate-LWL (AUC = 0.976), CG-LWL and Bagging-LWL (AUC = 0.972), and LWL (AUC = 0.965) for predicting the spatial pattern of fire susceptibilities across the study area. Our study promotes the application of ensemble models in forest fire prediction and enhances the researchers' understanding of the processes of model building. Although these four ensemble models were originally developed for the estimation of forest fire susceptibility, the models are sufficiently general to be used for predicting other types of natural hazards, such as landslides, floods, and dust storms, by considering local geo-environmental factors.

In addition to the high cost of mitigation and damage to property, floods make roads impassable and hamper community evacuation, movement of goods and services, and rescue missions. Knowing the depth of floodwater is critical to the success of response and recovery operations that follow. However, flood mapping especially in urban areas using traditional methods such as remote sensing and digital elevation models (DEMs) yields large errors due to reshaped surface topography and microtopographic variations combined with vegetation bias. This paper presents a deep neural network approach to detect submerged stop signs in photos taken from flooded roads and intersections, coupled with Canny edge detection and probabilistic Hough transform to calculate pole length and estimate floodwater depth. Additionally, a tilt correction technique is implemented to address the problem of sideways tilt in visual analysis of submerged stop signs. An in-house dataset, named BluPix 2020.1 consisting of paired web-mined photos of submerged stop signs across 10 FEMA regions (for U.S. locations) and Canada is used to evaluate the models. Overall, pole length is estimated with an RMSE of 17.43 and 8.61 in. in pre- and post-flood photos, respectively, leading to a mean absolute error of 12.63 in. in floodwater depth estimation. Findings of this research are sought to equip jurisdictions, local governments, and citizens in flood-prone regions with a simple, reliable, and scalable solution that can provide (near-) real time estimation of floodwater depth in their surroundings.

EKW is one of the resourceful wetland ecosystems of the world which offers a bundle of direct and indirect ecosystem services to the Kolkata megacity region. The rapid expansion of built-up in the surrounding urban agglomeration of the EKW is putting immense pressure on the EKW and the rate of wetland loss has been highest in recent decades. To ensure that this distinct ecosystem is conserved, an efficient means of identifying wetland conversion risk is needed. This study aims to assess the risk of EKW conversion using two advanced data-driven Machine Learning (ML) models, viz, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The novelty of the paper is in the fact that ML models have been widely applied to groundwater potential, flood susceptibility, and landslide susceptibility, their applicability to wetland conversion risk assessment has not yet been explored. The advantage of RF and SVM is that both of the ML models can overcome the limitations of pre-assumption based conventional methods of wetland risk assessment. A total of eight factors are selected which can be categorized into ecological, bio-physical, demographic, and physical infrastructure groups. Both results indicate that around 60% area under medium to very high-risk zones. A comparison is also made between these two methods to identify the most precise prediction method for this study area. The results of the models are quantitatively validated applying the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) method, where both of this method identifies SVM as a more precise predictive model for this study with 91.12% accuracy. The spatial pattern of encroachment and shrinkage of EKW triggered by urban expansion is successfully captured by RF and ME. Policy analysts and land-use planners can use the outcome derived from RF and SVM models and associated maps to identify the risk zones, assess the effectiveness of wetland conservation programs, design effective policies to stop further degradation of the wetlands, and adopt long-term sustainable planning for this precious ecosystem.

During the event, flash floods and several landslides caused losses of lives, evacuation of people from their homes, collapses of infrastructure and large constructions, destruction of agricultural fields, and many other economic losses. The meteorological conditions before and during the flood were analyzed here and compared with long-term records. The flood extent and the landslide susceptibility were investigated by using multisensor and multitemporal data. Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-2 optical data, and aerial photogrammetric datasets were employed for the investigations using machine learning techniques. The changes were assessed both at a local and regional level and evaluated together with available damage reports. The analysis of the rainfall data recorded during the two weeks before the floods and landslides in heavily affected regions shows that the rainfall continued for consecutive hours with an amount of up to 68 mm/hour. The regional level classification results obtained from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data by using the random forest (RF) method exhibit 97% accuracy for the flood class. The landslide susceptibility prediction performance from aerial photogrammetric datasets was 92% represented by the Area Under Curve (AUC) value provided by the RF method. The results presented here show that considering the occurrence frequency and immense damages after such events, the use of novel remote sensing technologies and spatial analysis methods is unavoidable for disaster mitigation efforts and for the monitoring of environmental effects. Although the increasing number of earth observation satellites complemented with airborne imaging sensors is capable of ensuring data collection requirement with diverse spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions, further studies are required to automate the data processing, efficient information extraction, and data fusion and also to increase the accuracy of the results.

The glaciers are melting faster than expected which has resulted in global mean sea level rise and increased the risk of floods. The development of modern remote sensing technology has made it possible to obtain images more frequently than ever before. On the other side, the availability of high-performance computing hardware and processing techniques have made it possible to provide a cost-effective solution to monitor the temporal changes of glaciers at a large scale. In this study, supervised machine learning methods are investigated for automatic classification of glacier covers from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery using texture, topographic, and spectral data. Three most commonly used supervised machine learning techniques were investigated: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF). The proposed method was employed on the data obtained from Passu watershed in Hunza Basin located along the Hunza river in Pakistan. Three main classes were considered: glaciers, debris-covered glaciers and non-glaciated areas. The data was split into training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Finally, an area-based accuracy assessment was performed by comparing the results obtained for each classifier with the reference data. Experiments showed that the results produced for all classifiers were highly accurate and visually more consistent with the depiction of glacier cover types. For all experiments, random forest performed the best (Kappa = 0.95, f-measure = 95.06%) on all three classes compared to ANN (Kappa = 0.92, f-measure = 92.05) and SVM (Kappa = 0.89, f-measure = 91.86% on average). The high classification accuracy obtained to distinguished debris-covered glaciers using our approach will be useful to determine the actual available water resources which can be further helpful for hazard and water resource management.

Atlantic and Gulf coasts under two different climate scenarios (current and future). The flood hazard is presented as the hurricane surge flood level with 1% annual exceedance probability (100-year flood) under the two scenarios, where the future scenario considers the effect of hurricane climatology change and sea level rise towards late-21st-century under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5). This hazard information is combined with estimated vulnerability and disaster resilience of coastal communities to map the relative current and future risk employing different risk definitions. Several geographical techniques and spatial distributional models (e.g., spatial autocorrelation, spatial hotspot analysis, and spatial multivariate clustering analysis) are applied to systematically analyze the risk and identify statistically significant hotspots of the highest risk. Most of the high-risk hotspots are found in the Gulf coast region, particularly along the west coast of Florida. However, two out of three risk evaluation approaches also indicate New York City as a risk hotspot under the future climate-showing that the resultant risk is sensitive to the consideration of evaluation factors (i.e., hazard, vulnerability, and resilience). Additionally, we apply a machine-learning algorithm-based spatial multivariate approach to map the spatially distinct groups based on the values of risk, hazard, vulnerability, and resilience. The results show that the counties in the highest risk group (value >3rd quartile, 15% of total counties, including New York City) in the future lack specifically in the community capital and the social components of community resilience. This assessment of coastal risk to hurricane flood has important policy-relevant implications to provide a focus-for-action for risk reduction and resilience enhancement for the US., where 6.5 million households live in the hurricane flood-prone areas.

It is imperative to explore the potential changes in future water resources and water-related hazards at the regional scale under global warming and local socioeconomic development, while a scientific assessment of future hydrological risks requires reasonable projection of future climate, land use and vegetation changes. In order to improve the traditional statistical downscaling method, this study combines the machine learning and quantile mapping methods to project future climate under four shared socio-economic pathway-representative concentration pathways (SSP-RCP) of the CMIP6. Future land use is projected jointly with the future climate by the CA-Markov model, and the vegetation dynamics are simulated by the Biome-BGC model. Then we employ a physically-based distributed hydrological model to simulate the future hydrological changes in the Upper Chao Phraya basin under the interaction among climate and land use changes and the vegetation dynamics. The results show that under the joint impact of climate and land-use changes, the study area may face increasing water scarcity and more frequent floods and droughts in the future. Water scarcity will reach the worst in the mid-21st century (water resources per capita decrease 34.2% compared to the 2010 s). By the end-21st century, the 100-year historical flood and drought in the study basin will increase by 1.63 times and 0.59 times, respectively, under the SSP126 scenario (the most sustainable pathway), and by 4.55 times and 1.56 times under the SSP370 scenario (the most pessimistic rocky-road pathway). Results demonstrate that climate change is the major cause for more frequent floods and droughts in the future, while afforestation or more sustainable land use management will mitigate the adverse effects of climate change to some extent. This finding is helpful to the local government in managing future water resources, floods, and droughts in the study basin.

While majority of those models produce reasonably accurate flood predictions, the outcomes are subject to uncertainty since flood susceptibility models (FSMs) may produce varying spatial predictions. However, there have not been many attempts to address these uncertainties because identifying spatial agreement in flood projections is a complex process. This study presents a framework for reducing spatial disagreement among four standalone and hybridized ML-based FSMs: random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and hybridized genetic algorithm-gaussian radial basis function-support vector regression (GA-RBF-SVR). Besides, an optimized model was developed combining the outcomes of those four models. The southwest coastal region of Bangladesh was selected as the case area. A comparable percentage of flood potential area (approximately 60% of the total land areas) was produced by all ML-based models. Despite achieving high prediction accuracy, spatial discrepancy in the model outcomes was observed, with pixel-wise correlation coefficients across different models ranging from 0.62 to 0.91. The optimized model exhibited high prediction accuracy and improved spatial agreement by reducing the number of classification errors.

Recently, this area has experienced many extreme natural processes, which become natural hazard events when they intersect with human activities (urban areas and infrastructures). In this work, the probabilities of the three main hazards; landslides, floods, and gully erosion are mapped using machine learning algorithms such as boosted regression tree (BRT), generalized linear model (GLM), Flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), random forest (RF), and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA). Several factors from various sources, including, topographic, geologic, meteorological, hydrologic, and human activities, were incorporated to produce the final multi-hazard susceptibility model. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the best predictive model for each type of natural hazard. AUC values between 80 and 90% indicated that the model was very good, and values above 90% indicated that the model had excellent predictive capability. Based on the accuracy evaluation, the FDA model was found to be the most accurate landslides prediction with an AUC value of (92.7%, excellent performance). The RF model was found to be the most accurate in predicting floods and erosion with AUC values of (97.2% - excellent and 83.3% - very good performance, respectively). Finally, a map of multi-hazard susceptibility was created by coupling of the mentioned three hazards. The results showed that 33.5% of the total area is safe (no-hazard), while 66.5% is characterized by at least a single hazard and a combination of two or three hazards. Machine learning approaches are useful tools as a basis for management and mitigation processes, based on multi-hazard modeling.

Extreme weather events, such as floods, rising sea levels, and storms, stand as characteristic examples that impair the core services of the global ecosystem. Especially floods have a severe impact on human activities, hence, early and accurate delineation of the disaster is of top priority since it provides environmental, economic, and societal benefits and eases relief efforts. In this article, we introduce OmbriaNet, a deep neural network architecture, based on convolutional neural networks, that detects changes between permanent and flooded water areas by exploiting the temporal differences among flood events extracted by different sensors. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach, we generated OMBRIA, a bitemporal and multimodal satellite imagery dataset for image segmentation through supervised binary classification. It consists of a total number of 3.376 images, synthetic aperture radar imagery from Sentinel-1, and multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2, accompanied with ground-truth binary images produced from data derived by experts and provided from the Emergency Management Service of the European Space Agency Copernicus Program. The dataset covers 23 flood events around the globe, from 2017 to 2021. We collected, co-registrated and preprocessed the data in Google Earth Engine. To validate the performance of our method, we performed different benchmarking experiments on the OMBRIA dataset and we compared with several competitive state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental analysis demonstrated that the proposed formulation is able to produce high-quality flood maps, achieving a superior performance over the state-of-the-art.

The nighttime light (NTL) datasets have been widely utilized to estimate the socio-economic parameters. However, the precision of the published datasets was too coarse to meet related issues such as flood losses assessment, urban planning, and epidemiological studies. The present study calibrated gross domestic product (GDP), population (POP), electric consumption (EC), and urban build-up area (B-A) at 100 m resolution for 45 cities of China in 2018 using Luojia1-01 NTL datasets via random forest (RF) as well as geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The linear regression (LR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector machine (SVM) methods were selected for comparison with GWR and RF models. Besides, the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) was chosen for comparison with Luojia1-01. The ten-folded cross-validation (CV) has been used for evaluating accuracy at county and city scales. Finally, the distribution maps of socio-economic parameters were illustrated and some findings were obtained. First, the validation results revealed that the calibration at the city-scale outperformed the county or district scale. Second, the precision of the Luojia1-01 NTL dataset surpassed the NPP-VIIRS NTL dataset on the same administrative scale except for some specific situations. Third, the precision of the simulation for the gross domestic product (GDP) is the highest than the others, followed by electric consumption (EC), build-up area (B-A), and population (POP). Fourth, the optimum model varied according to the socio-economic parameters. Fifth, the distribution of socio-economic parameters exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity. This paper can supply scientific support for calibrating socio-economic parameters in other regions. Â© 2013 IEEE.",IEEE Access,10.1109/access.2021.3059865,19,7,No,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A first step towards securing lives and infrastructure is the susceptibility mapping and predicting of occurrence sites of FF. Several studies have been applied using an ensemble machine learning model (EMLM) but measuring FF magnitude using a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (MCL) and geohydrological models have not been widely applied. This study aims to modify a hybrid approach by testing three machine learning models. These are boosted regression tree (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), and naive Bayes tree (NBT) for FF susceptibility mapping at the northern part of the United Arab Emirates (NUAE). This is followed by applying a group of accuracy metrics (precision, recall and F1 score) and the receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The result demonstrated that the BRT has the highest performance for FF susceptibility mapping followed by the CART and NBT. After that, the produced FF map using the BRT was then modified by dividing it into seven basins, and a set of new FF conditioning parameters namely alluvial plain width, basin gradient and mean slope for each basin was calculated for measuring FF magnitude. The results showed that the mountainous and narrower basins (e.g., RAK, Masafi, Fujairah, and Rol Dadnah) have the highest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude, while the wider alluvial plains (e.g., Al Dhaid) have the lowest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude. The proposed approach is an effective approach to improve the susceptibility mapping of FF, landslides, land subsidence, and groundwater potentiality obtained using ensemble machine learning, which is used widely in the literature.

Moreover, recent research has shown that these networks can also provide promising results for natural language processing. In this case, the basic idea is to concatenate the vector representations of words into a single block and use it as an image. However, despite the good results, the problem of using convolution networks is the large numbers of design decisions that need to be made a priori. These models require the definition of many hyper-parameters, including the type of word embeddings, which consists of the data vectorized representation, the activation function that prints the non-linearity characteristics to the model, the size of the filter that applies data convolution, the number of feature maps, which are responsible for identifying the attributes and the pooling method used for data reduction. In addition, one must also predefine the regularization constant and the dropout rate, which are responsible for avoiding any network over-fitting. In existing research works, convolutional neural network architectures capable of overcoming the performance of traditional machine learning models are presented. Even though these can compete with more complex models, the problem of how the different setting of the hyper-parameters may affect the performance of this type of network has not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose an efficient sentiment analysis classifier using convolutional neural networks by analyzing the impact of the hyper-parameters on the model performance. The main interest in analyzing sentiment comes from the advent of social media and the technological advances that flood the Internet with opinions. Nonetheless, mining the Internet for opinion and sentiment analysis is not an easy task and thus needs outstanding models with the best hyper-parameters setting to be able to get pertinent answers. The results achieved are obtained with the use of GPU and show that the different configurations exceed the reference models in the most of the cases with gains of up to 18% and have similar performance to the models of the state of the art with gains of up to 2% in some cases.",EVOLUTIONARY INTELLIGENCE,10.1007/s12065-019-00227-4,13,7,No,Brazil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our work aims to propose a state-of-the-art model for susceptibility mapping of the flash flood using the decision tree random subspace ensemble optimized by hybrid firefly-particle swarm optimization (HFPS), namely the HFPS-RSTree model. In this work, we used data from a flood inventory map consisting of 1866 polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and a field survey conducted in the northwest mountainous area of the Van Ban district, Lao Cai Province in Vietnam. A total of eleven flooding conditioning factors (soil type, geology, rainfall, river density, elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), plant curvature, and profile curvature) were used as explanatory variables. These indicators were compiled from a geological and mineral resources map, soil type map, and topographic map, ALOS PALSAR DEM 30 m, and Landsat-8 imagery. The HFPS-RSTree model was trained and verified using the inventory map and the eleven conditioning variables and then compared with four machine learning algorithms, i.e., the support vector machine (SVM), the random forests (RF), the C4.5 decision trees (C4.5 DT), and the logistic model trees (LMT) models. We employed a range of statistical standard metrics to assess the predictive performance of the proposed model. The results show that the HFPS-RSTree model had the best predictive performance and achieved better results than those of other benchmarks with the ability to predict flash flood, reaching an overall accuracy of over 90%. It can be concluded that the proposed approach provides new insights into flash flood prediction in mountainous regions.

The physical hydrologic models of flash flood prediction of any large area is very difficult to compute as it requires lot of data and time. Therefore remote sensing data based models (from statistical to machine learning) have become highly popular due to open data access and lesser prediction times. There is a continuous effort to improve the prediction accuracy of these models through introducing new methods. This study is focused on flash flood modeling through novel hybrid machine learning models, which can improve the prediction accuracy. The hybrid machine learning ensemble approaches that combine the three meta-classifiers (Real AdaBoost, Random Subspace, and MultiBoosting) with J48 (a tree-based algorithm that can be used to evaluate the behavior of the attribute vector for any defined number of instances) were used in the Gorganroud River Basin of Iran to assess flood susceptibility (FS). A total of 426 flood positions as dependent variables and a total of 14 flood conditioning factors (FCFs) as independent variables were used to model the FS. Several threshold-dependent and independent statistical tests were applied to verify the performance and predictive capability of these machine learning models, such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the success rate curve (SRC) and prediction rate curve (PRC), efficiency (E), root-mean square-error (RMSE), and true skill statistics (TSS). The valuation of the FCFs was done using AdaBoost, frequency ratio (FR), and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models. In the flooding of the study area, altitude, land use/land cover (LU/LC), distance to stream, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and rainfall played important roles. The Random Subspace J48 (RSJ48) ensemble method with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931 (SRC), 0.951 (PRC), E of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.87, and TSS of 0.78, has become the most effective ensemble in predicting the FS. The FR technique also showed good performance and reliability for all models. Map removal sensitivity analysis (MRSA) revealed that the FS maps have the highest sensitivity to elevation. Based on the findings of the validation methods, the FS maps prepared using the machine learning ensemble techniques have high robustness and can be used to advise flood management initiatives in flood-prone areas.

Twelve indices were chosen and 2000 sample points were created for model training and testing. Hyperparameter optimization of the models was conducted to ensure fair comparisons.

Urban and rural areas and coastal and inland areas were also compared to determine the flood risk mechanism in different highest-risk areas. The results showed that the GBDT performed best and provided the most reasonable flood risk result among the six models. A comparison of the driving factors at different risk levels indicated that the disaster-inducing factor, disaster-breeding environment, and disasterbearing body were not definitely becoming more serious as the flood risk increased. In the highest-risk areas, rural areas were featured by worse disaster-breeding environment than urban areas, and the disaster-inducing factors of coastal areas were more serious than those of inland areas.

Afterward, an intelligent learning machine (Random Forest (RF)), which is a robust data mining technique, was used to compute the importance degree of each index and to obtain the flood hazard map. According to the results, the indices of WRD, RD, M1DP, and El accounted for about 68.27 percent of the total flood risk. Among these indices, the WRD index containing about 23.8 percent of the total risk has the greatest impact on floods.

There is a need to develop accurate models for flood susceptibility prediction and mapping, which can be helpful in developing more efficient flood management plans. In this study, the Partial Decision Tree (PART) classifier and the AdaBoost, Bagging, Dagging, and Random Subspace ensembles learning techniques were combined to develop novel GIS-based ensemble computational models (ABPART, BPART, DPART and RSSPART) for flood susceptibility mapping in the Quang Binh Province, Vietnam. In total, 351 flood locations were used in the model study. This data was divided into a 70:30 ratio for model training (70% ? 255 locations) and (30% ? 96 locations) for model validation. Ten flood influencing factors, namely elevation, slope, curvature, flow direction, flow accumulation, river density, distance from river, rainfall, land-use, and geology, were used for the development of models. The OneR feature selection method was used to select and prioritize important factors for the spatial modeling. The results revealed that land-use, geology, and slope are the most important conditioning factors in the occurrence of floods in the study area. Standard statistical methods, including the ROC curve (AUC), were used for the performance evaluation of models.

Furthermore, a set of conditioning forces to explain the flash floods was constructed which included aspect, land use and land cover (LULC), hydrological soil groups lithology, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), profile curvature, convergence index and stream power index (SPI). All models indicated the slope as the most important factor triggering the flash flood occurrence.

The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), like many mountainous regions, is the site of multiple and overlapping natural hazards, but the distribution of multi-hazard risk and the populations exposed to it are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution transboundary models describing susceptibility to floods, landslides, and wildfires to understand population exposure to multi-hazard risk across the HKH. These models are created from historical remotely sensed data and hazard catalogs by the maximum entropy (Maxent) machine learning technique. Our results show that human settlements in the HKH are disproportionately concentrated in areas of high multi-hazard risk. In contrast, low-hazard areas are disproportionately unpopulated. Nearly half of the population in the region lives in areas that are highly susceptible to more than one hazard. Warm low-altitude foothill areas with perennially moist soils were identified as highly susceptible to multiple hazards. This area comprises only 31% of the study region, but is home to 49% of its population. The results also show that areas susceptible to multiple hazards are also major corridors of current migration and urban expansion, suggesting that current rates and patterns of urbanization will continue to put more people at risk. This study establishes that the population in the HKH is concentrated in areas susceptible to multiple hazards and suggests that current patterns of human movement will continue to increase exposure to multi-hazards in the HKH.

Accurate and timely mapping of flood extent to ascertain damages is critical and essential for relief activities. Recently, deep-learning-based approaches, including convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown promising results for flood extent mapping. However, these methods cannot extract floods underneath vegetation canopy using the optical imagery. This article attempts to address this problem by introducing an integrated CNN and region growing (RG) method for the mapping of both visible and underneath vegetation flooded areas. The CNN-based classifier is used to extract flooded areas from the optical images, whereas, the RG method is applied to estimate the extent of floods underneath vegetation that are not visible from imagery using the digital elevation model. A data augmentation technique is applied for training the CNN-based classifier to improve the classification results. The results show that the data augmentation can enhance the accuracy of image classification and the proposed integrated method efficiently detects floods in both the visible and the areas covered by vegetation, which is essential to supporting effective flood emergency response and recovery activities.

Many protocols that form the Internet infrastructure expose a set of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to carry out a set of attacks. DNS, one of the most critical elements of the Internet, is among these protocols. It is vulnerable to DDoS attacks mainly because all exchanges in this protocol use User Datagram Protocol (UDP). These attacks are difficult to defeat because attackers spoof the IP address of the victim and flood him with valid DNS responses coming from legitimate DNS servers. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable solution, called WisdomSDN, to effectively mitigate DNS amplification attack in the context of software defined networks (SDN). WisdomSDN covers both detection and mitigation of illegitimate DNS requests and responses. WisdomSDN consists of: (1) a novel proactive and stateful scheme (PAS) to perform one-to-one mapping between DNS requests and DNS responses; it operates proactively by sending only legitimate responses, excluding amplified illegitimate DNS responses; (2) a machine learning DDoS detection module to detect, in real-time, illegitimate DNS requests. This module consists of (a) Flow statistics collection scheme (FSC) to gather the features of flows in an efficient and scalable way using sFlow protocol; (b) Entropy calculation scheme (ECS) to measure randomness of network traffic; and (c) Bayes Network based Filtering scheme (BNF) to classify, based on entropy values, illegitimate DNS requests; and (3) DNS Mitigation scheme (DM) to effectively mitigate illegitimate DNS requests. The experimental results show that, compared to state-of-art, WisdomSDN can effectively detect/mitigate DNS amplification attack quickly with high detection rate, less false positive rate, and low overhead making it a promising solution to mitigate DNS amplification attack in a SDN environment.

The hydrographs provide early warning of possible flooding prior to typhoon landfall, and then real-time updates of expected flooding along the typhoonâs path. The method associates different types of typhoon tracks with landscape topography and runoff data to estimate the water inflow into a reservoir, allowing prediction of flood hydrographs up to two days in advance with continual updates. Modelling involves identifying typhoon track vectors, clustering vectors using a self-organizing map, extracting flow characteristic curves, and predicting flood hydrographs.

Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment.

In this study, we applied a state-of-the-art U-Net semantic segmentation network to map forested wetland inundation in the Delmarva area by integrating leaf-off World View-3 (WV3) multispectral data with fine spatial resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) intensity and topographic data, including a digital elevation model (DEM) and topographic wetness index (TWI).

In this study, an urban flood data warehouse was established with available structured and unstructured urban flood data. Based on this, a regression model to predict the depth of urban flooded areas was constructed with deep learning algorithm, named Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT). The flood condition factors used in modeling were rainfall, rainfall duration, peak rainfall, evaporation, land use (the proportion of roads, woodlands, grasslands, water bodies and building), permeability, catchment area, and slope. Based on the rainfall data of different rainfall return periods, flood condition maps were produced using GIS. In addition, the feature importance of these conditioning factors was determined based on the regression model. The results demonstrated that the growth rate of the number and depth of the water accumulation points increased significantly after the rainfall return period of 'once in every two years' in Zhengzhou City, and the flooded areas mainly occurred in the old urban areas and parts of southern Zhengzhou. The relative error of prediction results was 11.52%, which verifies the applicability and validity of the method in the depth prediction of urban floods.

In recent times, flood hazard susceptibility mapping has become a prime concern in minimizing the worst impact of this global threat; but the nonlinear relationship between several flood causative factors and the dynamicity of risk levels makes it complicated and confronted with substantial challenges to reliable assessment. Therefore, we have considered SVM, RF, and ANNâthree distinctive ML algorithms in the GIS platformâto delineate the flood hazard risk zones of the subtropical Kangsabati river basin, West Bengal, India; which experienced frequent flood events because of intense rainfall throughout the monsoon season. In our study, all adopted ML algorithms are more efficient in solving all the non-linear problems in flood hazard risk assessment; multi-collinearity analysis and Pearsonâs correlation coefficient techniques have been used to identify the collinearity issues among all fifteen adopted flood causative factors. In this research, the predicted results are evaluated through six prominent and reliable statistical (âAUC-ROC, specificity, sensitivity, PPV, NPV, F-scoreâ) and one graphical (Taylor diagram) technique and shows that ANN is the most reliable modeling approach followed by RF and SVM models. The values of AUC in the ANN model for the training and validation datasets are 0.901 and 0.891, respectively. The derived result states that about 7.54% and 10.41% of areas accordingly lie under the high and extremely high flood danger risk zones. Thus, this study can help the decision-makers in constructing the proper strategy at the regional and national levels to mitigate the flood hazard in a particular region. This type of information may be helpful to the various authorities to implement this outcome in various spheres of decision making. Apart from this, future researchers are also able to conduct their research byconsidering this methodology in flood susceptibility assessment.

Assessing flash flood susceptibility by hybrid models of statistical and machine learning methods is essential for flood mitigation strategies and disaster preparedness. Although classifying the flash flood conditioning factors becomes a crucial step before applying these hybrid models, their impact on the accuracy of integrated modeling is still unclear. Most previous studies used natural break classification (NBC) and quantile classification methods by default to conduct the classification, but more classification methods have not been tried. In this context, this study introduced three clustering algorithms of K-Means, Expectation Maximization, and ISOMaximum likelihood algorithm (ISOMax) into the classification of factors, and compared them to NBC and quantile classification. To test the impact of classification methods on integrated modeling, these classification results were applied into the construction of three hybrid models (i.e., the integrating of frequency ratio with support vector machines, random forest, and bayesian-regularization neural networks). Then, the accuracy of these hybrid models was evaluated by using ROC curves and statistical indicators. The classification results show that the clustering intervals in the same factor varied with classification algorithms. It can be found from the model performance evaluation results that different classification algorithms will lead to discrepancies in accuracy of integrated modeling. Compared to NBC, the ISOMax allows a better fitting and prediction ability of hybrid models in this study. The application of clustering algorithm provides a new perspective for improving the accuracy of integrated modeling.

The quantitative identification of their influence on the reduction of urban flood susceptibility (UFS) is of great significance in providing scientific references for urban flood control. In this study, we constructed a conceptual method to investigate the spatial variation of UFS based on the machine learning models (i.e., Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)), which has been tested in Wuhan City of China with good performances. After model evaluation, we have quantitatively studied the impact of two flood mitigation measures (pumping stations and LID practices) on the UFS. In particular, we evaluated the UFS mitigation efficiency of several designed scenarios using different combinations of pump discharges and LID area fractions by comparing them against default scenarios. We found a nonlinear negative response relation between the reduction of UFS with either the increase in pump discharge or LID area fractions. The proportion of the area of highest susceptibility (PAH) decreases as the pumping capacity increases, and when the pumping capacity is 2.5 times the default condition, the PAH reduces to 45% from 73.7% of no pump stations and reaches its minimum value. When the LID layout area is 100% of the whole region, the PAH can reduce to 51% from 67.7% of no LID. The findings can be beneficial for the design of optimal preventative strategy to sufficiently reduces UFS.

This study aims at using machine learning solutions to investigate and predict flood susceptibility from selected rivers in the south-eastern region of Nigeria. The regional hydrogeological data from 1981â2019 was collected and analysed. The remote sensing datasets from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) version 2 & 3 platforms from five selected rivers were processed. With the data output of the hydrology, streamline flows, and exposed geology, the ARIMA model was built and used to forecast the flood. The result shows that the flooding pattern would increase by 15-150% within 2020-2024. The forecast indicated that within five years, the river discharge for Adada, Ajali, Imo, Ivo, and Otanmiri will increase within ranges 200-702 m3s-1, 16-26 m3s-1, 508-1280 m3s-1, 43-68.5 m3s-1, and 22-35.1 m3s-1 respectively.

The objective of this study is to propose and demonstrate a smart flood resilience framework that leverages heterogeneous community-scale big data and infrastructure sensor data to enhance predictive risk monitoring and situational awareness. The smart flood resilience framework focuses on four core capabilities that could be augmented by the use of heterogeneous community-scale big data and analytics techniques: (1) predictive flood risk mapping; (2) automated rapid impact assessment; (3) predictive infrastructure failure prediction and monitoring; and (4) smart situational awareness capabilities. We demonstrate the components of these core capabilities of the smart flood resilience framework in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. First, we present the use of flood sensors for the prediction of floodwater overflow in channel networks and inundation of co-located road networks. Second, we discuss the use of social media and machine learning techniques for assessing the impacts of floods on communities and sensing emotion signals to examine societal impacts. Third, we describe the use of high-resolution traffic data in network-theoretic models for nowcasting of flood propagation on road networks and the disrupted access to critical facilities, such as hospitals. Fourth, we introduce how location-based and credit card transaction data were used in spatial analyses to proactively evaluate the recovery of communities and the impacts of floods on businesses. These analyses show that the significance of core capabilities of the smart flood resilience framework in helping emergency managers, city planners, public officials, responders, and volunteers to better cope with the impacts of catastrophic flooding events.

For this aim, flood-prone areas and their susceptibility are mapped using machine learning techniques including boosted regression tree (BRT) and generalized linear model (GLM) with the help of Sentinel 3 satellite images in Google Earth Engine. The BRT model achieved the highest precision (AUC = 81.10%) in comparison to GLM (AUC = 78.30%) and was utilized for evaluating the flood risk on critical infrastructures. In addition, the flood risk in four large and famous watersheds, namely Zohre, Dorodzan, Tashk-Bakhtegan, and Qareagaj located in Fars Province was analyzed, among which Zohre had the highest risk to flooding. The assessment of flood risk on critical infrastructures, such as hospitals, pharmacies, banks, fire stations, automated teller machines, fuel stations, speed cameras, and mosques located in Shiraz County (capital of Fars Province) disclosed that these structures had high and very high flood hazard. The evaluation of flood risk on schools situated in nine most populated cities of Fars Province was also carried out, which revealed that Shiraz had the maximum percentage (92.98%) and Marvdasht had the least percentage (60.75%) of schools that fall under very high risk.

With the rise in population growth and the spread of infrastructural development, the level of risk has increased over time. Therefore, the prediction of flood susceptible area is a key challenge for the adoption of management plans. Flood susceptibility modeling is technically a common work, but it is still a very tough job to validate flood susceptible models in a very rigorous and scientific manner. Therefore, the present work in the Atreyee River Basin of India and Bangladesh was planned to establish artificial neural network (ANN), radial basis function (RBF), random forest (RF) and their ensemble-based flood susceptibility models. The flood susceptible models were constructed based on nine flood conditioning parameters. The flood susceptibility models were validated in a conventional way using the receiver operating curve (ROC). To validate the flood-susceptible models, a two dimensional (2D) hydraulic flood simulation model was developed. Also, the index of flood vulnerability model was developed and applied for validating the flood susceptible models, which was a very unique way to validate the predictive models. Friedman test and Wilcoxon Signed rank test were employed to compare the generated flood susceptible models. Results showed that 11.95%â12.99% of the entire basin area (10188.4 km2) comes under very high flood-susceptible zones. Accuracy evaluation results have shown that the performance of ensemble flood susceptible models outperforms other standalone machine learning models.

In this study, the aim was to identify the areas susceptible to floods using and comparing two different approaches, namely the multi-criteria decision analysis-analytical hierarchy process (MCDA-AHP) and the machine learning-boosted classification (BCT) and boosted regression (BRT) tree. The study area was represented by the Top?a river basin, Slovakia. Altogether, seven relevant flood conditioning factors: elevation, slope, river network density, distance from river, flow accumulation, curve numbers and lithology as well as flood inventory database consisting of 107 flood locations were used. Based on the results, almost 40% of the study area is characterized by high to very high flood susceptibility using the MCDA-AHP. In case of the BCT and BRT models, the share of high and very high flood susceptibility class on the basin area is 45% and 38%, respectively. Validation of the performed flood susceptibility models confirmed generally higher accuracy of the machine learning models. The accuracy of the MCDA-AHP model was 81.33% while the accuracy of the boosted tree models was 87.70% and 91.42%, respectively, for classification and regression. The results of this study can enhance more effective preliminary flood risk assessment according to the EU Floods Directive. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

MS sensors are limited to cloud free conditions, whereas SAR imagery is plagued by noise-like speckle. Prior studies that use combinations of MS and SAR data to overcome individual limitations of these sensors have not fully examined sensitivity of flood mapping performance to different combinations of SAR and MS derived spectral indices or band transformations in color space. This study explores the use of diverse bands of Sentinel 2 (S2) through well-established water indices and Sentinel 1 (S1) derived SAR imagery along with their combinations to assess their capability for generating accurate flood inundation maps. The robustness in performance of S-1 and S-2 band combinations was evaluated using 446 hand labeled flood inundation images spanning across 11 flood events from Sen1Floods11 dataset which are highly diverse in terms of land cover as well as location. A modified K-fold cross validation approach is used to evaluate the performance of 32 combinations of S1 and S2 bands using a fully connected deep convolutional neural network known as U-Net. Our results indicated that usage of elevation information has improved the capability of S1 imagery to produce more accurate flood inundation maps. Compared to a median F1 score of 0.62 when using only S1 bands, the combined use of S1 and elevation information led to an improved median F1 score of 0.73. Water extraction indices based on S2 bands have a statistically significant superior performance in comparison to S1. Among all the band combinations, HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) transformation of S2 bands provides a median F1 score of 0.9, outperforming the commonly used water spectral indices owing to HSV's transformation's superior contrast distinguishing abilities. Additionally, U-Net algorithm was able to learn the relationship between raw S2 based water extraction indices and their corresponding raw S2 bands, but not of HSV owing to relatively complex computation involved in the latter. Results of the paper establishes important benchmarks for the extension of S1 and S2 data-based flood inundation mapping efforts over large spatial extents.

It should be noted that flash-flood events are triggered by heavy rainfall in small river catchments. To achieve the proposed results, a total of 8 flash-flood predictors (slope angle, plan curvature, hydrological soil groups, land use, convergence index, profile curvature, topographic position index, aspect) along with a sample of 111 torrential phenomena points were used as input datasets in the next four algorithms: Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), Deep Learning Neural Network -Analytical Hierarchy Process (DLNN-AHP), Multilayer Perceptron - Analytical Hierarchy Process (MLP-AHP) and NaÃ¯ve Bayes - Analytical Hierarchy Process (NB-AHP). The Analytical Hierarchy Process was used to calculate the coefficients for each class/category of flash-flood predictors. The torrential points sample was split into training (70%) and validating samples (30%). The modelling was done in Excel, SPSS and R software (H2O package), while the result mapping was performed in ArcGIS 10.5 software. The analysis revealed that the high and very high susceptibility degrees are spread over a maximum of 35.01% of the study area. The best performances, demonstrated by an AUC-ROC of 0.984, are associated with the Deep Learning Neural Network â Analytical Hierarchy Process model, followed by NaÃ¯ve Bayes â Analytical Hierarchy Process model (AUC = 0.976), Multilayer Perceptron - Analytical Hierarchy Process model (AUC = 0.882) and Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (AUC = 0.807). These results indicates that Deep Learning Neural Network is a promising machine learning model which can provide outcomes with very high precision. Also, according to the present research results the deep learning neural network, having many hidden layers, is able outperform the multilayer perceptron that contains a single hidden layer. The main novelty of the present research is the application of the three ensemble models (DLNN-AHP, MLP-AHP and NB-AHP) and also the use of H2O package for the first time in literature, to evaluate the flash-flood susceptibility in small river catchments.

In addition, it proposes a humanitarian aid information system (HAIS) to enhance emergency support for flood victims. First, a flood hazard map was prepared using the hydrodynamic model (HM)âFLO 2D coupled with a machine learning algorithm (MLA)-scaled conjugate gradient neural network (SCG-NN). The performance of the MLA was evaluated using a validation dataset and statistical measures such as the mean square error (MSE: 0.080), root mean square error (RMSE: 0.282), and coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.830). According to the generated flood hazard map, most of the study area was classified as low (47.85%) or moderate (27.47%) hazardous zones, whereas only a small portion was delineated as high (20.64%) or very high (4.04%) hazardous zones. The accuracy of the hazard map (HM-MLA) versus the ground truth was tested statistically and was found to be high. Second, an investigation of local flood management strategies revealed that the current information system is not well prepared for emergencies, including the quantification of emergency relief necessities. Therefore, an HAIS, which specifies hazard information and quantifies emergency aids (food items) for flood victims, can be an effective emergency preparedness tool. We calculated the required emergency aid considering satellite-derived flood data. Finally, we conclude that the proposed HAIS will help humanitarian organizations and government agencies coordinate and perform relief operations effectively in the worst-hit regions across the country.

Moreover, the proliferation of SAR satellites with high spatial and temporal resolution provides a tremendous opportunity to understand the flood risk and its quick response. However, traditional algorithms to extract flood inundation using SAR often require manual parameter tuning or data annotation, which presents a challenge for the rapid automated mapping of large and complex flooded scenarios. To address this issue, we proposed a segmentation algorithm for automatic flood mapping in near-real-time over vast areas and for all-weather conditions by integrating Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with an unsupervised machine learning approach named Felz-CNN. The algorithm consists of three phases: (i) super-pixel generation; (ii) convolutional neural network-based featurization; (iii) super-pixel aggregation. We evaluated the Felz-CNN algorithm by mapping flood inundation during the Yangtze River flood in 2020, covering a total study area of 1,140,300 km2. When validated on fine-resolution Planet satellite imagery, the algorithm accurately identified flood extent with producer and user accuracy of 93% and 94%, respectively. The results are indicative of the usefulness of our unsupervised approach for the application of flood mapping. Meanwhile, we overlapped the post-disaster inundation map with a 10-m resolution global land cover map (FROM-GLC10) to assess the damages to different land cover types. Of these types, cropland and residential settlements were most severely affected, with inundation areas of 9,430.36 km2 and 1,397.50 km2, respectively, results that are in agreement with statistics from relevant agencies. Compared with traditional supervised classification algorithms that require time-consuming data annotation, our unsupervised algorithm can be deployed directly to high-performance computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine and PIE-Engine to generate a large-spatial map of flood-affected areas within minutes, without time-consuming data downloading and processing. Importantly, this efficiency enables the fast and effective monitoring of flood conditions to aid in disaster governance and mitigation globally.

Accurate, finely detailed cartographic representations of hydrologic streamlines are critically important in various scientific domains, such as assessing the quantity and quality of present and future water resources, modeling climate changes, evaluating agricultural suitability, mapping flood inundation, and monitoring environmental changes. Conventional approaches to detecting such streamlines cannot adequately incorporate information from the complex three-dimensional (3D) environment of streams and land surface features. Such information is vital to accurately delineate streamlines. In recent years, high accuracy lidar data has become increasingly available for deriving both 3D information and terrestrial surface reflectance. This study develops an attention U-net model to take advantage of high-accuracy lidar data for finely detailed streamline detection and evaluates model results against a baseline of multiple traditional machine learning methods. The evaluation shows that the attention U-net model outperforms the best baseline machine learning method by an average F1 score of 11.25% and achieves significantly better smoothness and connectivity between classified streamline channels. These findings suggest that our deep learning approach can harness high-accuracy lidar data for fine-scale hydrologic streamline detection, and in turn produce desirable benefits for many scientific domains.

Determining the extent of flooding in situ has shortcomings due to the possible limited spatial and temporal resolutions of data and the cost of data collection. Therefore, this research focused on flood mapping using geospatial data and remote sensing. The research area is located in the central part of the Republic of Croatia, an environmentally diverse area of lowland forests of the Sava River and its tributaries. Flood mapping was performed by merging Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) mission data and applying object-based image analysis (OBIA). For this purpose, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data (GRD processing level) were primarily used during the flood period due to the possibility of all-day imaging in all weather conditions and flood detection under the density of canopy. The pre-flood S2 imagery, a summer acquisition, was used as a source of additional spectral data. Geographical information system (GIS) layers-a multisource forest inventory, habitat map, and flood hazard map-were used as additional sources of information in assessing the accuracy of and interpreting the obtained results. The spectral signature, geometric and textural features, and vegetation indices were applied in the OBIA process. The result of the work was a developed methodological framework with a high accuracy and speed of production. The overall accuracy of the classification is 94.94%. Based on the conducted research, the usefulness of the C band of the S1 in flood mapping in lowland forests in the leaf-off season was determined.

While Pakistan is frequently hit by several natural hazards (i.e., floods, droughts, earthquakes, and extreme heatwaves) resulting in devastating impacts, no national-level higher-resolution disaster resilience information is available to provide references for informed planning. Hence, this study provides a, first of its kind, multi-level comprehensive disaster resilience evaluation in Pakistan. To do so, data on a customized list of indicators within three key resilience sub-components (i.e., economic, institutional, and social) are acquired to compute a resilience index. Frequency distribution and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) methods are employed to analyse the differences between different resilience indices and a cross-regional assessment is carried out at the sub-national level. Subsequently, an extensive spatial assessment is performed using geo-information models (i.e., Global Moran's I, Local Indicators of Spatial Association, and machine learning-based multivariate clustering) to explore the global and local geographies of the resilience. Based on ANOVA, significant differences between the resilience sub-components are found (95% confidence). The geographical distribution of resilience scores ascertains a large spatial heterogeneity across the study area with the least resilient regions belonging to Sindh and Balochistan provinces (95% confidence). As shown by the machine learning-based multivariate clustering, the least resilient regions particularly lack in economic and institutional aspects of disaster resilience. The findings provide important references to ensure resilience management-related cross-regional equity and justice. The rigorous analyses regarding the geographies of disaster resilience in Pakistan are important to support the country's disaster risk reduction efforts. While the results are useful for practitioners, decision-makers, and professionals in the risk management field, the study has important policy-relevant implications in the context of disaster risk mitigation strategies.

It should be noticed that recent droughts caused by climate change, and on the other hand, population growth has increased the rate of urbanization in Iran, where people are moving from rural areas to urban areas. In this study, two well-known machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Complex Tree (CTree), are used for land cover mapping. An advanced supervised algorithm, namely the Derivative-free Multi-layer Perceptron (FDMLP), which is based on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) function, is developed in MATLAB programming language. The FDMLP uses a derivative-free function for the optimization of the MLP function parameters. Three different scenarios using Landsat-8 imagery with spatial resolutions of 30 and 15 m are defined to investigate the effects of data pre-processing on the final predicted Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used for LULC mapping as well. The FDMLP classifier has outperformed the other two well-known algorithms of the SVM and the CTree for the classification of the pixel-based Landsat-8 imagery and the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m in terms of the overall accuracy and index of kappa. Based on the test data, the DNN classifier for the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m with values of 91.28 and 88.57 percent for the OA and Kappa index has outperformed the other supervised classifiers.

The 3U cubesat constellation of Planet Labs offers the capability of imaging the whole Earth landmass everyday at 3-4mspatial resolution. The higher spatial, as well as temporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery in comparison with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, makes it a valuable data source for monitoring the glacial lakes. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of the PlanetScope imagery for glacial lakes mapping with a focus on the Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalaya (HKKH) region. Though the revisit time of the PlanetScope imagery is short, courtesy of 130+ small satellites, this imagery contains only four bands and the imaging sensors in these small satellites exhibit varying spectral responses as well as lower dynamic range. Furthermore, the presence of cast shadows in the mountainous regions and varying spectral signature of the water pixels due to differences in composition, turbidity and depth makes it challenging to automatically and reliably extract surface water in PlanetScope imagery. Keeping in view these challenges, this work uses state of the art deep learning models for pixel-wise classification of PlanetScope imagery into the water and background pixels and compares the results with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The deep learning model is based on the popular U-Net architecture. We evaluate U-Net architecture similar to the original U-Net as well as a U-Net with a pre-trained EfficientNet backbone. In order to train the deep neural network, ground truth data are generated by manual digitization of the surface water in PlanetScope imagery with the aid of Very High Resolution Satellite (VHRS) imagery. The created dataset consists of more than 5000 water bodies having an area of approx. 71 km2 in eight different sites in the HKKH region. The evaluation of the test data show that the U-Net with EfficientNet backbone achieved the highest F1 Score of 0.936. A visual comparison with the existing glacial lake inventories is then performed over the Baltoro glacier in the Karakoram range. The results show that the deep learning model detected significantly more lakes than the existing inventories, which have been derived from Landsat OLI imagery. The trained model is further evaluated on the time series PlanetScope imagery of two glacial lakes, which have resulted in an outburst flood. The output of the U-Net is also compared with the GLakeMap data. The results show that the higher spatial and temporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery is a significant advantage in the context of glacial lakes mapping and monitoring.

Experts' judgment favored four clusters, while Squared Euclidean distance was the best performing distance measure. SOM provided cluster visuals of the input attributes within the four different groups and transformed the dataset into a labeled one. A 5-layered Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) driven by hybrid learning algorithm was applied to classify and predict FSL. ANFIS optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA) produced root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.323 and Error Standard Deviation of 0.408 while Particle Swarm Optimized ANFIS model produced 0.288 as the RMSE, depicting 11% improvement when compared with GA optimized model. The result shows significant improvement in the classification and prediction of flood risks using single ML tool.

The present research aimed to map the vegetation from the phenological behavior of the Sentinel-1 time series, which has the advantage of not having atmospheric interference and cloud cover. Furthermore, the study compared three different sets of images (vertical-vertical co-polarization (VV) only, vertical-horizontal cross-polarization (VH) only, and both VV and VH) and different classifiers based on deep learning (long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU)) and machine learning (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Multilayer Perceptron). The time series englobed four years (2017-2020) with a 12-day revisit, totaling 122 images for each VV and VH polarization. The methodology presented the following steps: image pre-processing, temporal filtering using the Savitsky-Golay smoothing method, collection of samples considering 17 classes, classification using different methods and polarization datasets, and accuracy analysis. The combinations of the VV and VH pooled dataset with the Bidirectional Recurrent Neuron Networks methods led to the greatest F1 scores, Bi-GRU (93.53) and Bi-LSTM (93.29), followed by the other deep learning methods, GRU (93.30) and LSTM (93.15). Among machine learning, the two methods with the highest F1-score values were SVM (92.18) and XGBoost (91.98).

The proposed end-to-end (rainfall-inundation) method combines a suite of machine learning (ML) algorithms to forecast discharge and deliver probabilistic flood inundation maps with a 3 h lead time. To classify wet/dry cells, the method applies rainfall-discharge models based on random forest technique on top of classifiers based on multi-layer perceptron. The hybrid modelling framework was tested using two subsets of data created from an observed fluvial flood event in a small flood-prone town in the UK. The results showed that the model can effectively emulate the outcomes of a hydrodynamic model (Flood Modeller (FM)) with considerably high accuracy measured in terms of flood arrival time error and classification accuracy. The mean arrival time difference between the proposed model and the hydrodynamic model was 1 h 53 min. The classification accuracy was measured against a synthetic aperture radar image, producing accuracies of 88.22% and 86.58% for the proposed data-driven model and FM, respectively.

This is due to the sensing characteristics of remote sensing platforms and lack of robust data processing techniques. Advancements in data analytic tools, such as the introduction of Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform provides unique opportunities for improved assessment of small and scattered wetlands. This study thus assessed the capabilities of GEE cloud-computing platform in characterising small seasonal flooded wetlands, using the new generation Sentinel 2 data from 2016 to 2020. Specifically, the study assessed the spectral separability of different land cover classes for two different wetlands detected, using Sentinel-2 multi-year composite water and vegetation indices and to identify the most suitable GEE machine learning algorithm for accurately detecting and mapping semi-arid seasonal wetlands. This was achieved using the object based Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Naive Bayes (NB) advanced algorithms in GEE. The results demonstrated the capabilities of using the GEE platform to characterize wetlands with acceptable accuracy. All algorithms showed superiority, in mapping the two wetlands except for the NB method, which had lowest overall classification accuracy. These findings underscore the relevance of the GEE platform, Sentinel-2 data and advanced algorithms in characterizing small and seasonal semi-arid wetlands. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Remote-sensing offers the unique possibility for continuous measurements of this variable. Especially for agriculture, there is a strong demand for high spatial resolution mapping. However, operationally available soil moisture products exist with medium to coarse spatial resolution only (>= 1 km). This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-based approach for the high spatial resolution (50 m) mapping of soil moisture based on the integration of Landsat-8 optical and thermal images, Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR images, and modelled data, executable in the Google Earth Engine. The novelty of this approach lies in applying an entirely data-driven ML concept for global estimation of the surface soil moisture content. Globally distributed in situ data from the International Soil Moisture Network acted as an input for model training. Based on the independent validation dataset, the resulting overall estimation accuracy, in terms of Root-Mean-Squared-Error and R-2, was 0.04 m(3)center dot m(-3) and 0.81, respectively. Beyond the retrieval model itself, this article introduces a framework for collecting training data and a stand-alone Python package for soil moisture mapping.

However, operationalising and quantifying resilience is still a challenge. In Pakistan, very limited research has been done to assess community resilience to floods. The present study proposed an integrated flood resilience model called the âcapacity-based flood resilience model (CapFlooR-M)â, which is based on, machine learning (ML), geographical information system (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The CapFlooR-M incorporates four main componentsâflood hazard susceptibility (Is), coping capacity (Cc), adaptive capacity (Ac), and transformative capacity (Tc). Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were used to create a flood susceptibility map, and the AHP was used to compute the relative scores of core capacities, such as Cc, Ac, and Tc and their respective maps were generated. Finally, the susceptibility map was integrated with Cc, Ac, and Tc maps via overlay analysis in GIS to develop a flood resilience map. The overall results reveal that the northwestern and southwestern parts (36.64%; 505 km2) of the study area have moderate to very high resilience, while the central and southeastern parts (63.46%; 877 km2) have very low to low resilience. The findings of this novel approach can support policymakers, land use planners, and other relevant stakeholders to build resilience against flood hazards.

In this study, we explore the potential of the C-band of Sentinel-1 SAR time series dual-polarization (VV/VH) data for mapping, detecting and monitoring the flooded and flood-prone areas in the An Giang province in the Mekong Delta, especially its rice fields. Time series floodable area maps were generated from five images per month taken during the wet season (6â7 months) over two years (2019 and 2020). The methodology was based on automatic image classification through the application of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and random forests (RFs). Based on the segmentation technique, a three-level classification algorithm was developed to generate maps of the development of floods and floodable areas during the wet season. A modification of the backscatter intensity was noted for both polarizations, in accordance with the evolution of the phenology of the rice fields. The results show that the CNN-based methods can produce more reliable maps (99%) compared to the MLP and RF (97%). Indeed, in the classification process, feature extraction based on segmentation and CNNs has demonstrated an effective improvement in prediction performance of land use land cover (LULC) classes, deriving complex decision boundaries between flooded and non-flooded areas. The results show that between 53% and 58% of rice paddies areas and 9% and 14% of built-up areas are affected by the flooding in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Our methodology and results could support the development of the flood monitoring database and hazard management in the Mekong Delta.

In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning has brought endless possibilities to the field of flood detection. However, deep learning relies heavily on training samples and the availability of high-quality flood datasets is rather limited. The present study collected 16 flood events in the Yangtze River Basin and divided them into three categories for different purpose: training, testing, and application. An efficient methodology of dataset-generation for training, testing, and application was proposed. Eight flood events were used to generate strong label datasets with 5296 tiles as flood training samples along with two testing datasets. The performances of several classic convolutional neural network models were evaluated with those obtained datasets, and the results suggested that the efficiencies and accuracies of convolutional neural network models were obviously higher than that of the threshold method. The effects of VH polarization, VV polarization, and the involvement of auxiliary DEM on flood detection were investigated, which indicated that VH polarization was more conducive to flood detection, while the involvement of DEM has a limited effect on flood detection in the Yangtze River Basin. Convolutional neural network trained by strong datasets were used in near-real-time flood detection and mapping for the remaining eight flood events, and weak label datasets were generated to expand the flood training samples to evaluate the possible effects on deep learning models in terms of flood detection and mapping.

Flood models and remote sensing imagery are often used to predict and understand flooding. An increasing number of earth observation satellites are producing data at a rate that far outpaces our ability to manually extract meaningful information from it, motivating a surge in research on automatic feature detection in satellite imagery using machine learning and deep learning algorithms to automate flood mapping so that information from large streams of data can be extracted in near-real time and used for disaster response at landscape scale. The development of such an algorithm is predicated on exposure to training datasets that are representative of the full range of diversity in the spatial and spectral signature of surface water as it is sampled by space-based instruments. To address these needs, we developed a semantically labeled dataset of high-resolution multispectral imagery (Maxar WorldView 2/3) strategically sampled to be representative of North American surface water variability along five spatiotemporal strata: latitude, topographic complexity, land use, and day of year. This dataset was utilized to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically detect inundation extents using the Deep Earth Learning, Tools, and Analysis (DELTA) framework, an open source TensorFlow/Keras interpreter for satellite imagery. Our research objective was to demonstrate the out-of-sample accuracy of our trained CNN at landscape scale. The model performed well, with 98% precision and 94% recall for the water class during validation. We then evaluated the accuracy of our satellite-derived flood maps from trained machine learning model against a hydraulic model. For this, we compared predicted inundation extents against the USGS Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) Program's flood map library at 17 different locations, where the FIM library provides flood inundation extents based on hydraulic models built for river reaches and corresponding to stage measurements at a nearby USGS gaging site. Compared to the hydraulic model, we estimated the underprediction of flood inundation by optical remote sensing data in our areas of interest to be 62%. We used land use data from National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and cloud masks to estimate that 79% of underprediction was due to these obstructions, with 74% belonging to vegetation, 9% to clouds, and 4% to both. A significant amount of inundation is missed when only optical remote sensing data is considered, and we suggest the use of flood models along with remote sensing data for getting the most realistic flood inundation extents.

Using image-based 2D-CNN, 27% of the 247.7 km2 of the studied area was mapped with a high risk of flooding, with MLP-ANN overestimating the degree of high flood risk by 4.7%. Based on the gain ratio index analysis of the flood conditioning factors (FCFs), the most significant FCFs were LULC (18.5%), precipitation (14.9%), proximity to river (13.3%), and elevation (12.4%). Soil types contributed 8.6%, slope 9.1%, and the DEM-derived hodological conditioning indicators contributed 23.2%. The study results demonstrate that in urban areas with scarce hydrological monitoring networks, the use of image-based 2D-CNN with multiparametric spatial data can produce high-quality flood susceptibility maps for flood management in urban environments.

Given that glacial lakes have little area compared with background objects, extracting glacial lakes high precisely is still challenging. Recently, U-Net, a deep learning (DL) method, has shown great potential in glacial lake extraction, due to its elaborate encoder-decoder structure and powerful skip connections. However, the skip connections transmit a lot of information irrelevant to glacial lakes from the low-level appearance features to the high-level semantic features, leading to inefficient utilization of the low-level features. In this letter, we propose a normalized difference water index (NDWI) attention U-Net (NAU-Net) for pixel-wise glacial lake segmentation, which utilizes NDWI as a spatial attention to highlight the signals of water regions in low-level feature maps, thereby making the network pay more attention to glacial lakes. Compared with the classical networks and the state-of-the-art non-DL methods, our NAU-Net shows better performance on glacial lake extraction.

Here, surface fractional water cover (FW) retrievals derived from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band (1.4 GHz) brightness temperatures were used for flood assessment over southeast Africa during the Cyclone Idai event. We then focused on five subcatchments of the Pungwe basin and developed a machine learning based approach with the support of Google Earth Engine for daily (24-h) forecasting of FW and 30-m inundation downscaling and mapping. The Classification and Regression Trees model was selected and trained using retrievals derived from SMAP and Landsat coupled with rainfall forecasts from the NOAA Global Forecast System. Independent validation showed that FW predictions over randomly selected dates are highly correlated (R = 0.87) with the Landsat observations. The forecast results captured the flood temporal dynamics from the Idai event; and the associated 30-m downscaling results showed inundation spatial patterns consistent with independent satellite synthetic aperture radar observations. The data-driven approach provides new capacity for flood monitoring and forecasts leveraging synergistic satellite observations and big data analysis, which is particularly valuable for data sparse regions.

In the current paper, commonly used satellite imagery from the public domain for flood inundated extent capturing are studied considering Can Tho City as a study area. The differences in the flood inundated areas from different satellite sensors and the possible reasons are explored. An effective and relatively advanced method to address the uncertainties-inundated area capture from different remote sensing sensors-was implemented while establishing the inundated area pattern between the years 2000 and 2018. This solution involves the usage of a machine learning technique, Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) which further helps in filling the gaps whenever there is lack of data from a single satellite data source. This useful method could be extended to establish the inundated area patterns over the years in data-sparse regions and in areas where access is difficult.

However, recent studies have observed a tendency for policy search methods to overfit to the hydrologic data used in training, particularly the sequence of flood and drought events. This technical note develops an extension of bootstrap aggregation (bagging) and cross-validation techniques, inspired by the machine learning literature, to improve reservoir control policy performance on out-of-sample hydrological sequences. We explore these methods using a case study of Folsom Reservoir, California, using control policies structured as binary trees, and streamflow resampling based on the paleo-inflow record. Results show that calibration-validation strategies for policy selection coupled with certain ensemble aggregation methods can improve out-of-sample performance in water supply and flood risk objectives over baseline performance given fixed computational costs. Our findings highlight the potential to improve policy search methodologies by leveraging these well-established model training strategies from machine learning. Â© 2020. American Geophysical Union.

This study adopts a simple and coherent approach based on the self-organizing map to systematically derive the monsoon annual cycle based on 850-hPa wind fields. The derived onset dates in the warm season agree well with the literature despite lacking documentation for winter-season stages. Linear regression suggests an inverse relationship between the length of the Spring (Meiyu) stage and that of the Pre-Meiyu (Mid-summer) stage, suggesting predictability of the Meiyu and Fall onsets. The Aleutian Low, the western North Pacific subtropical high, and the upper-level westerlies play important roles in the Spring, Pre-Meiyu, and Meiyu onsets. Observations reveal strong rain belt events form right after the monsoonal wind onsets in the warm season. The proposed approach to deriving monsoon stages and onsets would be useful for monsoon climate studies and operational monsoon diagnosis and forecasting. Plain Language Summary The East Asian monsoon profoundly affect the livelihoods of more than one-fifth of the global population. Given its impacts and complexity, many efforts have been taken to define the different monsoon stages' arrival with diverse and inconsistent criteria. Instead of adding more complicated criteria, we adopt a machine-learning-based approach to derive the annual cycle of the East Asian monsoon stages in a simple and systematic way. The derived arrival timings of the warm-season stages are consistent with the literature despite lacking documentation for winter-season stages. Linear regression shows that the arrival of the preceding monsoon stages could inform that of the ensuing stage during the warm season. We find distinct weather systems that possibly explain the onset of monsoon stages. Further analysis indicates that heavy and persistent rain belt events in the warm season tend to form right after monsoonal wind stages' onsets. The machine-learning-based approach to deriving the monsoon stages and onsets would be useful for monsoon climate research and practical use in operational monsoon diagnosis and forecasting, thereby short-term planning for agricultural activities and flood control.",GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,10.1029/2020gl089542,13,5,No,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As coastal systems continue to become more socially and environmentally complex, the damage these hazards cause is expected to increase and intensify. To reduce such negative impacts, vulnerable coastal areas and their associated risks must be identified and assessed. In this study, we assessed the flooding risk to coastal areas of South Korea using multiple machine learning algorithms. We predicted coastal areas with high flooding risks, as this aspect has not been adequately addressed in previous studies. We forecasted hazards under different representative concentration pathway climate change scenarios and regional climate models while considering ratios of sea level rise. Based on the results, a risk probability map was developed using a probability ranging from 0 to 1, where higher values of probability indicate areas at higher risk of compound events such as high tides and heavy rainfall. The accuracy of the average receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.946 using a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The predicted risk probability in 10 year increments from the 2030s to the 2080s showed that the risk probability for southern coastal areas is higher than those of the eastern and western coastal areas.

We have developed a new ensemble learning model that predicts flash flood susceptibility at Haraz, Iran. The new model couples a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model with an extreme learning machine (ELM) and backpropagation (BP) structure optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) named GA-BN-NN model. We applied the support vector machine (SVM) technique to a database of 194 flood locations with ten conditioning factors. An artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm with a multi-layer perceptron function, MLP-BP, optimized by a genetic algorithm, GA-MLP, and a shuffled frog-leaping algorithm, SFLA-MLP, were used as benchmark models for assessing the power prediction of the proposed model. Statistical measures, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-measure and Jaccard coefficient, and root mean square error, were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, respectively, of the training and testing datasets. We found that all ten factors are positively correlated with flood occurrence, but slope angle has the highest average merit (AM=9.7) and thus contributes most to the occurrence of flooding. Results indicate that the GA-BN-NN model has the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy (AUC=0.966) and hence outperforms other ensemble learning models that we tested â the SFLA-MLP, MLP-BP, and GA-MLP models.

For this purpose, ten flood causative factors were chosen based on data availability and local conditions along with the spatial extent of the large flood that affected the study area on 13 May 2013. The factors used involved topography-related factors (elevation, slope, curvature, topographic wetness index, and stream power index), lithology, soil, land use/land cover, the average of annual rainfall, and distance to rivers. The multicollinearity test proved that there was no multicollinearity problem among the factors used. Investigating the worth of factors in building the models using information gain ratio showed that the most important factors that play a major role in controlling flood proneness were elevation, followed by annual rainfall average, distance to rivers, land use/land cover, lithology, and soil. The models were employed using the most important factors to get flood proneness maps. The values of flood proneness were categorized into five classes using a quantile classification scheme. For validating the models, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used. The AUC for prediction data set was 0.793, 0.786, 0.779, 0.754, and 0.753 for classification and regression trees, boosted regression trees, logistic regression, information value, and frequency ratio, respectively. For the best performance model (classification and regression trees), the areas occupied by flood proneness zones were 2735 km2, 2809 km2, 2816 km2, 2732 km2, and 2801 km2, for very low, low, moderate, high, and very high flood proneness zones, respectively. The main conclusion is that the machine learning models are optimal in mapping flood proneness in the study area, followed by the multivariate and bivariate models.

The present work was, therefore, to investigate the performance of the resolution effects, such as coarse (Landsat and SRTM) and high (Sentinel-2 and ALOS PALSAR) resolution data on the flood susceptible models. Another motive of this study was to construct very high precision and robust flood susceptible models using standalone and ensemble machine learning algorithms. In the present study, fifteen flood conditioning parameters were generated from both coarse and high resolution datasets. Then, the ANN-multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), bagging (B)-MLP, B-gaussian processes (B-GP) and B-SMOreg algorithms were used to integrate the flood conditioning parameters for generating the flood susceptible models. Furthermore, the influence of flood conditioning parameters on the modelling of flood susceptibility was investigated by proposing an ROC based sensitivity analysis. The validation of flood susceptibility models is also another challenge. In the present study, we proposed an index of flood vulnerability model to validate flood susceptibility models along with conventional statistical techniques, such as the ROC curve. Results showed that the coarse resolution based flood susceptibility MLP model has appeared as the best model (area under curve: 0.94) and it has predicted 11.65 % of the area as very high flood susceptible zones (FSz), followed by RF, B-MLP, B-GP, and B-SMOreg. Similarly, the high resolution based flood susceptibility model using MLP has predicted 19.34 % of areas as very high flood susceptible zones, followed by RF (14.32 %),B-MLP (14.88 %), B-GP, and B-SMOreg. On the other hand, ROC based sensitivity analysis showed that elevation influences flood susceptibility largely for coarse and high resolution based models, followed by drainage densityand flow accumulation. In addition, the accuracy assessment using the IFV model revealed that the MLP model outperformed all other models in the case of a high resolution imageThe coarser resolution image's performance level is acceptable but quite low. So, the study recommended the use of high resolution images for developing a machine learning algorithm based flood susceptibility model. As the study has clearly identified the areas of higher flood susceptibility and the dominant influencing factors for flooding, this could be used as a good database for flood management.

Efficient flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) can reduce the risk of this hazard, and has become the main approach in flood risk management. In this study, we evaluated the prediction ability of artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms for hard and soft supervised machine learning classification in FSM by using three ANN algorithms (multi-layer perceptron (MLP), fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (FART), self-organizing map (SOM)) with different activation functions (sigmoidal (-S), linear (-L), commitment (-C), typicality (-T)). We used integration of these models for predicting the spatial expansion probability of flood events in the Ajichay river basin, northwest Iran. Inputs to the ANN were spatial data on 10 flood influencing factors (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, lithology, land use, rainfall, and distance to the river). The FSMs obtained as model outputs were trained and tested using flood inventory datasets earned based on previous records of flood damage in the region for the Ajichay river basin. Sensitivity analysis using one factor-at-a-time (OFAT) and all factors-at-a-time (AFAT) demonstrated that all influencing factors had a positive impact on modeling to generate FSM, with altitude having the greatest impact and curvature the least. Model validation was carried out using total operating characteristic (TOC) with an area under the curve (AUC). The highest success rate was found for MLP-S (92.1%) and the lowest for FART-T (75.8%).

While integration of hard and soft supervised machine learning classification with activation functions of MLP-S and MLP-L showed a strong flood prediction capability for proper planning and management of flood hazards, MLP-S is a promising method for predicting the spatial expansion probability of flood events.

Urban flood mapping and its use in making an urban development plan can reduce flood damages and losses. Constantly producing urban flood hazard maps using models that rely on the availability of detailed hydraulic-hydrological data is a major challenge especially in developing countries. In this study, urban flood hazard map was produced with limited data using three machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF) and NaÃ¯ve Bayes for Kermanshah city, Iran. The flood hazard predicting factors used in modeling were: slope, land use, precipitation, distance to river, distance to channel, curve number (CN) and elevation. Flood inventory map was produced based on available reports and field surveys, that 117 flooded points and 163 non-flooded points were identified. Models performance was evaluated based on area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), Kappa statistic and hits and miss analysis. The results show that RF model (AUC-ROC = 99.5%, Kappa = 98%, Accuracy = 90%, Success ratio = 99%, Threat score = 90% and Heidke skill score = 98%) performed better than other models. The results also showed that distance to canal, land use and CN have shown more contribution among others for modeling the flood and precipitation had the least effect among other factors. The findings show that machine learning methods can be a good alternative to distributed models to predict urban flood-prone areas where there are lack of detailed hydraulic and hydrological data.

Therefore, XGBoost was used in a powerful approach to flash flood prediction mapping, with the obtained predictions providing important guidance for decision-makers with respect to future study site development.

However, few studies start to consider the influence due to the selected DMs and how to efficiently select a suitable DM for each SCV. These issues were well addressed in this study. The information loss rate (ILR), an index based on the information entropy, seems can be used to select optimal DM for each SCV. However, the ILR fails to show the actual influence of discretization because such index only considers the total amount of information of the discretized variables departing from the original SCV. Facing this issue, we propose an index, information change rate (ICR), that focuses on the changed amount of information due to the discretization based on each cell, enabling the identification of the optimal DM. We develop a case study with Random Forest (training/testing ratio of 7: 3) to assess flood susceptibility in Wanan County, China. The area under the curve-based and susceptibility maps-based approaches were presented to compare the ILR and ICR. The results show the ICR-based optimal DMs are more rational than the ILR-based ones in both cases. Moreover, we observed the ILR values are unnaturally small (<1%), whereas the ICR values are obviously more in line with general recognition (usually 10%â30%). The above results all demonstrate the superiority of the ICR. We consider this study fills up the existing research gaps, improving the ML-based natural hazard susceptibility assessments.

Previous studies explored flash flood susceptibility models; however, there is still a lack of case studies in the transport sector. This paper aimed to develop advanced hybrid machine learning (ML) algorithms for flash flood susceptibility modeling and mapping using data from the road network National Highway 6 in Hoa Binh province, Vietnam. A single ML model of reduced error pruning trees (REPT) and four hybrid ML models of Decorate-REPT, AdaBoostM1-REPT, Bagging-REPT, and MultiBoostAB-REPT were applied to develop flash flood susceptibility maps. Field surveys were conducted about the flash flood locations on the 115-km route length of the National Highway 6 in 2017, 2018, and 2019 flood events. This study used 88 flash flood locations and 14 flood conditioning factors to construct and validate the proposed models. Statistical metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, root mean square error, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, were applied to evaluate the modelsâ performance and accuracy. The DCREPT model showed the best performance (AUC = 0.988) among the training models and had the highest prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.991) among the testing models. We found that 12,572Â ha (Decorate-REPT), 9564Â ha (AdaBoostM1-REPT), 11,954Â ha (Bagging-REPT), 14,432Â ha (MultiBoostAB-REPT), and 17,660Â ha (REPT) of the 3-km buffer area of the highway are in the high- and very high-flash-flood-susceptibility areas. The proposed methodology could be potentially generalized to other transportation routes in mountainous areas to generate flash flood susceptibility prediction maps.

Therefore, an accurate prediction of susceptible areas to flash floods is crucial for developing measures to prevent, avoid, and minimize damages associated with flash floods. The aim of this research is to propose a new state-of-the-art model based on hybridizing Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) and the Credal Decision Tree (CDT) ensemble, namely the QPSO-CDTreeEns model, for spatial prediction of the flash flood. The concept of the proposed model is to build a forest tree of the CDT established through the Random Subspace ensemble. Therein, QPSO is integrated to optimize the three parameters, the subspace size, number of trees, and the maximum depth of trees. A district suffered from a high frequency of flash floods in the north-western mountainous area of Vietnam was selected as a case study. In this regard, a geospatial database that includes a total of 1698 flash flood and inundation polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images and ten input indicators were used to construct and to verify the proposed model. The result shows that the QPSO-CDT-Ens model performed well (Overall accuracy = 90.4, Kappa coefficient = 0.807) and outperformed the five machine learning algorithms in flash flood susceptibility mapping. Among the ten factors, the land-use/land-cover (LULC), the slope, the curvature, and the TWI are the most important indicators. We conclude that the proposed model is a promising tool for flash flood susceptibility mapping in the tropics and may assist decision-makers in sustainable land-use planning in the national disaster mitigation strategies.

It helps decision-makers to develop effective flood prevention and management plans. In this study, flood inventory data were prepared based on the historical and field surveys data by Sari municipality and regional water company of Mazandaran, Iran. The collected flood data accompanied with different variables (digital elevation model and slope have been considered as topographic variables, land use/land cover, precipitation, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel and depth to groundwater as environmental variables) were applied to novel hybridized model based on neural network and swarm intelligence-grey wolf algorithm (NN-SGW) to map flood-inundation. Several confusion matrix criteria were used for accuracy evaluation by cutoff-dependent and independent metrics (e.g., efficiency (E), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)). The accuracy of the flood inundation map produced by the NN-SGW model was compared with that of maps produced by four state-of-the-art benchmark models: random forest (RF), logistic model tree (LMT), classification and regression trees (CART), and J48 decision tree (J48DT). The NN-SGW model outperformed all benchmark models in both training (E = 90.5%, PPV = 93.7%, NPV = 87.3%, AUC = 96.3%) and validation (E = 79.4%, PPV = 85.3%, NPV = 73.5%, AUC = 88.2%). As the NN-SGW model produced the most accurate flood-inundation map, it can be employed for robust flood contingency planning. Based on the obtained results from NN-SGW model, distance from channel, distance from river, and depth to groundwater were identified as the most important variables for spatial prediction of urban flood inundation. This work can serve as a basis for future studies seeking to predict flood susceptibility in urban areas using hybridized machine learning (ML) models and can also be applied in other urban areas where flood inundation presents a pressing challenge, and there are some problems regarding required model and availability of input data.

In hindsight, it opened an engrossed area of research for flood hazard mapping, something that has previously been pursued yet not embraced as must they should. In pursuit of reconciling the decision-makers and authorities with the successful application of machine/deep learning models in pattern extraction and detection of hotspots, we employed a deep learning model named Deep Belief Network (DBN), and then it was hybridized using particle swarm optimization (DBN-PSO) and genetic algorithm (DBN-GA). Their results were compared to Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) that have been known as benchmark models in the field of flood susceptibility. The area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) were used for performance assessment through three sample partitioning replicates, which further indicated modelsâ predictive performance and robustness. Results revealed that DBN-PSO was the best model in terms of prediction performance (AUCmean = 0.957, TSSmean = 0.748) and robustness (RAUC = 0.6%, RTSS = 0.8%). Furthermore, all the standalone DBN and its hybrid models outperformed benchmark models including RF (AUCmean = 0.911, TSSmean = 0.714, RAUC = 1.5%, RTSS = 2.1%) and SVM (AUCmean = 0.899, TSSmean = 0.692, RAUC = 2.1%, RTSS = 2.3%). In addition, drainage density was the most important factor in flood susceptibility modeling. Accordingly, about 13.5% of the region was addressed as the high hazard zone of flood occurrence based on the DBN-PSO model, which should be considered for further pragmatic actions.

Here, we present new deep learning algorithms and a multi-source data fusion driven flood inundation mapping approach by leveraging a large-scale publicly available Sen1Flood11 dataset consisting of roughly 4831 labelled Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery gathered from flood events worldwide in recent years. Specifically, we proposed an automatic segmentation method for surface water, permanent water, and temporary water identification, and all tasks share the same convolutional neural network architecture.

This research studies and compares two methods for inundation depth estimation using UAV images and topographic data. The methods consist of three main stages: (1) extracting flooded areas and create 2D inundation polygons using deep learning; (2) reconstructing 3D water surface using the polygons and topographic data; and (3) deriving a water depth map using the 3D reconstructed water surface and a pre-flood DEM. The two methods are different at reconstructing the 3D water surface (stage 2). The first method uses structure from motion (SfM) for creating a point cloud of the area from overlapping UAV images, and the water polygons resulted from stage 1 is applied for water point cloud classification. While the second method reconstructs the water surface by intersecting the water polygons and a pre-flood DEM created using the pre-flood LiDAR data. We evaluate the proposed methods for inundation depth mapping over the Town of Princeville during a flooding event during Hurricane Matthew. The methods are compared and validated using the USGS gauge water level data acquired during the flood event.

In particular, urban wetlands are vital habitats for the people and the animals living amongst them. This is because wetlands provide great services, including water filtration, flood and drought mitigation, and recreational spaces. As such, several recent urban development plans are currently needed to monitor these invaluable ecosystems using time- and cost-efficient approaches. Accordingly, this study is designed to provide an initial response to the need of wetland mapping in the City of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Specifically, we produce the first high-resolution wetland map of the City of St. John's using advanced machine learning algorithms, very high-resolution satellite imagery, and airborne LiDAR. An object-based random forest algorithm is applied to features extracted from WorldView-4, GeoEye-1, and LiDAR data to characterize five wetland classes, namely bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and open water, within an urban area. An overall accuracy of 91.12% is obtained for discriminating different wetland types and wetland surface water flow connectivity is also produced using LiDAR data. The resulting wetland classification map and the water surface flow map can help elucidate a greater understanding of the way in which wetlands are connected to the city's landscape and ultimately aid to improve wetland-related conservation and management decisions within the City of St. John's.

The laboratory and field experiments indicated that the image segmentation technique was reproducible and accurate from a controlled environment to rain storms and localized flooding in small streams on the LSU campus. Moreover, the segmentation algorithm successfully estimated flood levels in Buffalo Bayou in downtown Houston, Texas during Hurricane Harvey. This signifies that if time-lapse imagery is available, this algorithm- and program-estimated water elevations can provide insight to the hydrograph and spatial inundation during flooding from rainstorms or hurricanes.

Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM), mostly based on statistical and machine learning methods, has been widely employed to mitigate flood risk; however, they neglect exposure and vulnerability assessment as the key components of flood risk. Flood risk assessment is often conducted by quantitative methods (e.g., probabilistic). Such assessment uses analytical and empirical techniques to construct the physical vulnerability curves of elements at risk, but the role of people's capacity, depending on social vulnerability, remains limited. To address this gap, this study developed a semiquantitative method, based on the spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). The model combines two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, and factors triggering coastal flooding in Bandar Abbas, Iran. It also employs an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model to weight indicators of hazard, exposure, and social vulnerability components. Under the most extreme flooding scenario, 14.8% of flooded areas were identified as high and very high risk, mostly located in eastern, western, and partly in the middle of the City. The results of this study can be employed by decision-makers to apply appropriate risk reduction strategies in high-risk flooding zones.

It is important to create accurate flood maps to plan (offline) and conduct (real-time) flood mitigation and flood rescue operations. Arguably, images collected from social media can provide useful information for that task, which would otherwise be unavailable. We introduce a computer vision system that estimates water depth from social media images taken during flooding events, in order to build flood maps in (near) real-time. We propose a multi-task (deep) learning approach, where a model is trained using both a regression and a pairwise ranking loss. Our approach is motivated by the observation that a main bottleneck for image-based flood level estimation is training data: it is difficult and requires a lot of effort to annotate uncontrolled images with the correct water depth. We demonstrate how to efficiently learn a predictor from a small set of annotated water levels and a larger set of weaker annotations that only indicate in which of two images the water level is higher, and are much easier to obtain. Moreover, we provide a new dataset, named DEEPFLOOD, with 8145 annotated ground-level images, and show that the proposed multi-task approach can predict the water level from a single, crowd-sourced image with approximate to 11 cm root mean square error.",ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.07.003,13,4,No,Switzerland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work compares state-of-the-art methods that address uncertainty quantification in Deep Neural Networks, pushing forward the reduced-order modeling approach of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Neural Networks (POD-NN) with Deep Ensembles and Variational Inference-based Bayesian Neural Networks on two-dimensional problems in space. These are first tested on benchmark problems, and then applied to a real-life application: flooding predictions in the Mille Iles river in the Montreal, Quebec, Canada metropolitan area. Our setup involves a set of input parameters, with a potentially noisy distribution, and accumulates the simulation data resulting from these parameters. The goal is to build a non-intrusive surrogate model that is able to know when it does not know, which is still an open research area in Neural Networks (and in AI in general). With the help of this model, probabilistic flooding maps are generated, aware of the model uncertainty. These insights on the unknown are also utilized for an uncertainty propagation task, allowing for flooded area predictions that are broader and safer than those made with a regular uncertainty-uninformed surrogate model. Our study of the time-dependent and highly nonlinear case of a dam break is also presented. Both the ensembles and the Bayesian approach lead to reliable results for multiple smooth physical solutions, providing the correct warning when going out-of-distribution. However, the former, referred to as POD-EnsNN, proved much easier to implement and showed greater flexibility than the latter in the case of discontinuities, where standard algorithms may oscillate or fail to converge.

Here, we use a deep learning algorithm called U-net and very high-resolution multispectral images (0.5 m) from GeoEye satellite to identify, segment and map canopy palms over similar to 3000 km(2) of Amazonian forest. The map was used to analyse the spatial distribution of canopy palm trees and its relation to human disturbance and edaphic conditions. The overall accuracy of the map was 95.5% and the F1-score was 0.7. Canopy palm trees covered 6.4% of the forest canopy and were distributed in more than two million patches that can represent one or more individuals. The density of canopy palms is affected by human disturbance. The post-disturbance density in secondary forests seems to be related to the type of disturbance, being higher in abandoned pasture areas and lower in forests that have been cut once and abandoned. Additionally, analysis of palm trees' distribution shows that their abundance is controlled naturally by local soil water content, avoiding both flooded and waterlogged areas near rivers and dry areas on the top of the hills. They show two preferential habitats, in the low elevation above the large rivers, and in the slope directly below the hill tops. Overall, their distribution over the region indicates a relatively pristine landscape, albeit within a forest that is critically endangered because of its location between two deforestation fronts and because of illegal cutting.

They are also sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances and are globally threatened. Understanding how flow regime drives the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetland habitats is fundamental to effective conservation practices. In this study, using Landsat imagery and the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, we mapped the winter distribution of four wetland habitats (i.e., Carex meadow, reedbed, mudflat, and shallow water) in East Dongting Lake, a Ramsar wetland in the middle to lower Yangtze Basin of China, for 34 years (1988â2021). The dynamics of wetland habitats were explored through pixel-by-pixel comparisons. Further, the response of wetland habitats to flow regime variations was investigated using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM). Our results demonstrated the constant expansion of reedbeds and shrinkage of mudflats, and that there were three processes contributing to the reduction in mudflat: (1) permanent replacement by reedbed; (2) irreversible loss to water; and (3) transitional swapping with Carex meadow. These changes in the relative extent of wetland habitats may degrade the conservation function of the Ramsar wetland. Moreover, the duration of the dry season and the date of water level withdrawal were identified as the key flow regime parameters shaping the size of wetland habitats. However, different wetland vegetation showed distinct responses to variations in flow regime: while Carex meadow increased with earlier water withdrawal and a longer dry season, reedbed continuously expanded independent of the flow regime corresponding to the increase in winter rainfall. Our findings suggested that flow regime acts in concert with other factors, such as climate change and sand mining in river channels, driving wetland habitat transition in a floodplain landscape. Therefore, effective conservation can only be achieved through diverse restoration strategies addressing all drivers.

The serious impact caused by floods is the reason for the urgent need to provide an appropriate flood susceptibility map (FSM). Floods can be triggered by various meteorological events, such as storms in coastal areas. On 14 March 2019, Cyclone Idai produced massive and severe flooding inundation in the coastal city of Beira, Mozambique. The extensive flood damage in Beira necessitated providing an accurate FSM and analyzing the factors associated with flooding. This study integrated the data of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), geographic information system (GIS), and two deep learning models, namely, the group method of data handling (GMDH) and convolutional neural network (CNN), to generate a precise FSM. We compared the performance of CNN and GMDH models in generating the FSMs for a case study of the March 2019 flood in the Beira Area, Mozambique. The result showed that the models produced a similar pattern of FSM, where the areas near the river, having a lower slope and lower altitude, have a higher flood risk. The FSM generated by CNN and GMDH models were compared to find a better model for flood risk assessment. The prediction performance of CNN model (AUC = 0.90 and RMSE = 0.022) was better than the result of GMDH model (AUC = 0.87 and RMSE = 0.089).

Open areas affected by flooding have low backscatter due to the specular reflection of calm water surfaces. Floodwater within built-up areas leads to double-bounce effects, the complexity of which depends on the configuration of floodwater concerning the facades of the surrounding buildings. Hence, it has been shown that the analysis of interferometric SAR coherence reduces the underdetection of floods in urbanized areas. Moreover, the high potential of deep convolutional neural networks for advancing SAR-based flood mapping is widely acknowledged. Therefore, we introduce an urban-aware U-Net model using dual-polarization Sentinel-1 multitemporal intensity and coherence data to map the extent of flooding in urban environments. It uses a priori information (i.e., an SAR-derived probabilistic urban mask) in the proposed urban-aware module, consisting of channel-wise attention and urban-aware normalization submodules to calibrate features and improve the final predictions. In this study, Sentinel-1 single-look complex data acquired over four study sites from three continents have been considered. The qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis have been carried out using six urban flood cases. A comparison with previous methods reveals a significant enhancement in the accuracy of urban flood mapping: the F1 score of flooded urban increased from 0.3 to 0.6 with few false alarms in urban area using our method.

To date, databases of instream infrastructure focus on larger dams with reservoirs that are comparatively easy to detect with remotely sensed imagery. Despite their impact on freshwater ecosystems, smaller infrastructure is often overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we require more systematic approaches, such as the Global River Obstruction Database (GROD) presented here, to map instream infrastructure.

In this study, the nine most relevant flood elements (such as distance from the river, rainfall, and drainage density) were chosen as flood conditioning variables for modeling. The FS model was produced using AHP technique. We used an empirical and binormal receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for validating the models. We performed Sensitivity analyses using a random forest (RF)-based mean Gini decline (MGD), mean decrease accuracy (MDA), and information gain ratio to find out the sensitive flood conditioning variables. After performing sensitivity analysis, the least sensitivity variables were eliminated. We re-ran the model with the rest of the parameters to enhance the modelâs performance. Based on previous studies and the AHP weighting approach, the general soil type, rainfall, distance from river/canal (Dr), and land use/land cover (LULC) had higher factor weights of 0.22, 0.21, 0.19, and 0.15, respectively. The FS model without sensitivity and with sensitivity performed well in the present study. According to the RF-based sensitivity and information gain ratio, the most sensitive factors were rainfall, soil type, slope, and elevation, while curvature and drainage density were less sensitive parameters, which were excluded in re-running the FS model with just vital parameters. Using empirical and binormal ROC curves, the new FS model yields higher AUCs of 0.835 and 0.822, respectively. It is discovered that the predicted modelâs robustness may be maintained or increased by removing less relevant factors. This study will aid decision-makers in developing flood management plans for the examined region. Â© 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, we present a flash flood regionalization approach using machine learning algorithms to generate the flash flood regionalization map. First, the random forest algorithm is used to identify thirteen key factors of flash floods from a series of rainfall and topographic factors that have great potential to drive the occurrence of flash floods. Second, the two-stage hybrid self-organizing-map-based clustering algorithm is built to delineate the homogeneous regions of flash floods according to the identified thirteen key factors. Third, the best clustering result is selected by the clustering validity indices and it is regarded as the initial regionalization map. Last, the post-processing is implemented to obtain the final regionalization map of flash floods. A case study in the Jiangxi province of China was conducted to generate the flash flood regionalization map with eighteen homogeneous regions. The regionalization map clearly divides the historical flash flood events with different densities into different regions and it is visually satisfied. The quantitative evaluation method further confirmed that the flash flood regionalization map can provide the determinant power of 77.31% for the spatial distribution of historical flash flood events. Hence, it is a valuable option to perform the flash flood regionalization of watersheds and it is beneficial for local government in the Jiangxi province of China in future flash flood mitigation and prevention.

Effective disaster response management requires near real-time information on flood extent. Satellite remote sensing is the only way of monitoring these dynamics across vast areas and over time. Previous water and flood mapping efforts have relied on optical time series, despite cloud contamination. This reliance on optical data is due to the availability of systematically acquired and easily accessible optical data globally for over 40 years. Prior research used either MODIS or Landsat data, trading either high temporal density but lower spatial resolution or lower cadence but higher spatial resolution. Both MODIS and Landsat pose limitations as Landsat can miss ephemeral floods, whereas MODIS misses small floods and inaccurately delineates flood edges. Leveraging high temporal frequency of 3â4 days of the existing Landsat-8 (L8) and two Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites combined, in this research, we assessed whether the increased temporal frequency of the three sensors improves our ability to detect surface water and flooding extent compared to a single sensor (L8 alone). Our study area was Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, one of the world's largest dryland basins that experiences ephemeral floods. We applied machine learning to NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) Surface Reflectance Product, which combines L8 and S2 observations, to map surface water and flooding dynamics. Our overall accuracy, estimated from a stratified random sample, was 99%. Our user's and producer's accuracy for the water class was 80% (Â±3.6%, standard error) and 76% (Â±5.8%). We focused on 2019, one of the most recent years when all three HLS sensors operated at full capacity. Our results show that water area (permanent and flooding) identified with the HLS was greater than that identified by L8, and some short-lived flooding events were detected only by the HLS. Comparison with high resolution (3 m) PlanetScope data identified extensive mixed pixels at the 30 m HLS resolution, highlighting the need for improved spatial resolution in future work. The HLS has been able to detect floods in cases when one sensor (L8) alone was not, despite 2019 being one of the driest years in the area, with few flooding events. The dense optical time-series offered by the HLS data is thus critical for capturing temporally dynamic phenomena (i.e., ephemeral floods in drylands), highlighting the importance of harmonized data such as the HLS.

In ephemeral streams, the geomorphological characterization of channels is complex due to episodic flows and riparian vegetation dynamics. Stream channel survey and classification at the watershed scale provide the basis for geomorphological conservation, process interpretation, assessing sensitivity to disturbance, and identifying reaches that supply and store sediment. Here, we present a stream classification based on a two-step approach: (1) automatic river segmentation based on spatial variability in channel/valley morphology from topographic measurements (LiDAR, light, detection and ranging), and (2) fluvial landform and vegetation density mapping derived from multispectral open-source satellite images (Sentinel-2) using support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. These analyses provide continuous, quantitative spatial values of geometric (channel/valley width, slope gradient, and route distance), landform (active channel and gravel bars with five densities of vegetation cover), and hydraulic (specific stream power) variables. Four stream types were identified in the Rambla de la Viuda catchment (~1500 km2), an ephemeral gravel-bed river in eastern Spain. The spatial distribution of channel types is explained by differences in geometry (active channel width, valley width, and slope gradient) and a hydraulic parameter (specific stream power). The landforms/vegetation patterns provided insight on causal relationships between erosion and deposition processes during high flow periods and the time since the most recent large disruptive flood event. Channel type distribution provided first-order predictions about the location of reaches that supply and store sediment and thus information on sediment continuity along the river. Dam effects on downstream reaches resulted in geomorphological disequilibrium, producing narrowing of the active channel, slope reduction, and a decrease of gravel bar areal extension. The proposed catchment scale analysis provides a comprehensive and replicable methodology for environmental planning in Mediterranean ephemeral streams to guide further hydromorphological surveys at the reach scale.

Vertical information from street view imagery can benefit a variety of studies. One notable application is estimating the lowest floor elevation, which is critical for building flood vulnerability assessment and insurance premium calculation. In this article, we explored the vertical measurement in street view imagery using the principle of tacheometric surveying. In the case study of lowest floor elevation estimation using Google Street View images, we trained a neural network (YOLO-v5) for door detection and used the fixed height of doors to measure doorsâ elevation. The results suggest that the average error of estimated elevation is 0.218 m. The depthmaps of Google Street View were utilized to traverse the elevation from the roadway surface to target objects.

A first step towards securing lives and infrastructure is the susceptibility mapping and predicting of occurrence sites of FF. Several studies have been applied using an ensemble machine learning model (EMLM) but measuring FF magnitude using a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (MCL) and geohydrological models have not been widely applied. This study aims to modify a hybrid approach by testing three machine learning models. These are boosted regression tree (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), and naive Bayes tree (NBT) for FF susceptibility mapping at the northern part of the United Arab Emirates (NUAE). This is followed by applying a group of accuracy metrics (precision, recall and F1 score) and the receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The result demonstrated that the BRT has the highest performance for FF susceptibility mapping followed by the CART and NBT. After that, the produced FF map using the BRT was then modified by dividing it into seven basins, and a set of new FF conditioning parameters namely alluvial plain width, basin gradient and mean slope for each basin was calculated for measuring FF magnitude. The results showed that the mountainous and narrower basins (e.g., RAK, Masafi, Fujairah, and Rol Dadnah) have the highest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude, while the wider alluvial plains (e.g., Al Dhaid) have the lowest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude. The proposed approach is an effective approach to improve the susceptibility mapping of FF, landslides, land subsidence, and groundwater potentiality obtained using ensemble machine learning, which is used widely in the literature.

One of the most severe consequences of this phenomenon is Groundwater Flooding (GF), with serious impacts for the human and natural environment. In Europe, GF has recently received specific attention with Directive 2007/60/EC, which requires Member States to map GF hazard and propose measures for risk mitigation. In this paper a methodology has been developed for Groundwater Flooding Susceptibility (GFS) assessment, using for the first time Spatial Distribution Models. These Machine Learning techniques connect occurrence data to predisposing factors (PFs) to estimate their distributions. The implemented methodology employs aquifer type, depth of piezometric level, thickness and hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated zone, drainage density and land-use as PFs, and a GF observations inventory as occurrences. The algorithms adopted to perform the analysis are Generalized Boosting Model, Artificial Neural Network and Maximum Entropy. Ensemble Models are carried out to reduce the uncertainty associated with each algorithm and increase its reliability. GFS is mapped by choosing the ensemble model with the best predictivity performance and dividing occurrence probability values into five classes, from very low to very high susceptibility, using Natural Breaks classification. The methodology has been tested and statistically validated in an area of 14,3 km2 located in the Metropolitan City of Naples (Italy), affected by GWLr since 1990 and GF in buildings and agricultural soils since 2007. The results of modeling show that about 93% of the inventoried points fall in the high and very high GFS classes, and piezometric level depth, thickness of unsaturated zone and drainage density are the most influencing PFs, in accordance with field observations and the triggering mechanism of GF. The outcomes provide a first step in the assessment of GF hazard and a decision support tool to local authorities for GF risk management.

Recently, machine learning models have been used for flood susceptibility mapping. However, even when these algorithms are provided with adequate ground truth training samples, they can fail to predict flood extends reliably. On the other hand, the height above nearest drainage (HAND) model can produce flood prediction maps with limited accuracy. The objective of this research is to produce an accurate and dynamic flood modeling technique to produce flood maps as a function of water level by combining the HAND model and machine learning. In this paper, the HAND model was utilized to generate a preliminary flood map; then, the predictions of the HAND model were used to produce pseudo training samples for a R.F. model. To improve the R.F. training stage, five of the most effective flood mapping conditioning factors are used, namely, Altitude, Slope, Aspect, Distance from River and Land use/cover map. In this approach, the R.F. model is trained to dynamically estimate the flood extent with the pseudo training points acquired from the HAND model. However, due to the limited accuracy of the HAND model, a random sample consensus (RANSAC) method was used to detect outliers. The accuracy of the proposed model for flood extent prediction, was tested on different flood events in the city of Fredericton, NB, Canada in 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019. Furthermore, to ensure that the proposed model can produce accurate flood maps in other areas as well, it was also tested on the 2019 flood in Gatineau, QC, Canada. Accuracy assessment metrics, such as overall accuracy, Cohenâs kappa coefficient, Matthews correlation coefficient, true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR), were used to compare the predicted flood extent of the study areas, to the extent estimated by the HAND model and the extent imaged by Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellites. The results confirm that the proposed model can improve the flood extent prediction of the HAND model without using any ground truth training data. Â© 2020 by the authors.

The public dataset Sen1Floods11 recently released by the Cloud to Street is one example of ongoing beneficial initiatives to employ deep learning for flood detection with synthetic aperture radar. The present study used this dataset to improve flood detection using well-known segmentation architectures, such as SegNet and UNet, as networks. In addition, this study provided a deeper understanding of which set of polarized band combination is more suitable for distinguishing permanent water, as well as flooded areas from the SAR image. The overall performance of the models with various kinds of labels and a combination of bands to detect all surface water areas were also assessed. Finally, the trained models were tested on a com-pletely different location at Kerala, India, during the 2018 flood for verifying their performance in the real-world situation of a flood event outside of the given test set in the dataset. The results prove that trained models can be used as off-the-shelf models to achieve an intersection over union (IoU) as high as 0.88 in comparison with optical images.

This study provides a new strategy for runoff modelling as one of the complicated variables by developing new machine learning techniques along with remote sensing. A novel scheme of the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) known as the generalized structure of GMDH (GSGGMDH) is developed to overcome this classical approach's limitation. A simple time series based scenario with exogenous variables including precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was introduced for runoff forecasting. MODIS data included MOD13Q1 product was employed and a JavaScript code was developed to preprocess collected data in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. Using different seasonal and non-seasonal lags of all input variables, the developed GSGMDH found the most optimum input combination for each station in terms of simplicity and accuracy, simultaneously (average values; SI = 0.554, RMSRE = 1.55, MAE = 5.076). The precipitation values are modelled with the CanEsm2 climate change model. To apply NDVI for runoff forecasting, a simple spatial-temporal GSGMDH based model was developed (average values; SI = 0.27; RMSRE = 8.27, MAE = 0.08). The forecasting results indicated that the months in which the maximum runoff occurred have changed, and these months have increased compared to the historic period. In the historical period, the frequency of maximum runoff was in April and March. Still, for the two forecasting periods (i.e. 2020â2039 and 2040â2059), the months in which the maximum runoff has occurred have changed, and their amount has been reduced and added to other months, especially February and August.

These three hybrid models integrate a bivariate statistical method of the fuzzy membership value (FMV) and three machine learning methods of support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression trees (CART), and convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, a geospatial database was prepared comprising nine flood conditioning factors, 485 flood locations, and 485 non-flood locations. Then, the database was used to train and test the three hybrid models. Subsequently, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, seed cell area index (SCAI), and classification accuracy were used to evaluate the performances of the models. The results reveal the following: (1) The ROC curve highlights the fact that the CNN-FMV hybrid model had the best fitting and prediction performance, and the area under the curve (AUC) values of the success rate and the prediction rate were 0.935 and 0.912, respectively. (2) Based on the results of the three model performance evaluation methods, all three hybrid models had better prediction capabilities than their respective single machine learning models. Compared with their single machine learning models, the AUC values of the SVM-FMV, CART-FMV, and CNN-FMV were 0.032, 0.005, and 0.055 higher; their SCAI values were 0.05, 0.03, and 0.02 lower; and their classification accuracies were 4.48%, 1.38%, and 5.86% higher, respectively. (3) Based on the results of the flood susceptibility indices, between 13.21% and 22.03% of the study area was characterized by high and very high flood susceptibilities.

For this aim, flood-prone areas and their susceptibility are mapped using machine learning techniques including boosted regression tree (BRT) and generalized linear model (GLM) with the help of Sentinel 3 satellite images in Google Earth Engine. The BRT model achieved the highest precision (AUC = 81.10%) in comparison to GLM (AUC = 78.30%) and was utilized for evaluating the flood risk on critical infrastructures. In addition, the flood risk in four large and famous watersheds, namely Zohre, Dorodzan, Tashk-Bakhtegan, and Qareagaj located in Fars Province was analyzed, among which Zohre had the highest risk to flooding. The assessment of flood risk on critical infrastructures, such as hospitals, pharmacies, banks, fire stations, automated teller machines, fuel stations, speed cameras, and mosques located in Shiraz County (capital of Fars Province) disclosed that these structures had high and very high flood hazard. The evaluation of flood risk on schools situated in nine most populated cities of Fars Province was also carried out, which revealed that Shiraz had the maximum percentage (92.98%) and Marvdasht had the least percentage (60.75%) of schools that fall under very high risk.

While various statistical and climate models have been developed for the purpose of simulating extremes, a consistent definition of extreme events is still lacking. Furthermore, to better assess the performance of the climate models, a variety of spatial forecast verification measures have been developed. However, in most cases, the spatial verification measures that are widely used to compare mean states do not have sufficient theoretical justification to benchmark extreme events. In order to alleviate inconsistencies when defining extreme events within different scientific communities, we propose a new generalized Spatio-Temporal Threshold Clustering method for the identification of extreme event episodes, which uses machine learning techniques to couple existing pattern recognition indices with high or low threshold choices. The method consists of five main steps: (1) construction of essential field quantities; (2) dimension reduction; (3) spatial domain mapping; (4) time series clustering; and (5) threshold selection. We develop and apply this method using a gridded daily precipitation dataset derived from rain gauge stations over the contiguous United States. We observe changes in the distribution of conditional frequency of extreme precipitation from large-scale well-connected spatial patterns to smaller-scale more isolated rainfall clusters, possibly leading to more localized droughts and heat waves, especially during the summer months. The proposed method automates the threshold selection process through a clustering algorithm and can be directly applicable in conjunction with modeling and spatial forecast verification of extremes. Additionally, it allows for the identification of synoptic-scale spatial patterns that can be directly traced to the individual extreme episodes, and it offers users the flexibility to select an extreme threshold that is linked to the desired geometrical properties. The approach can be applied to broad scientific disciplines. Â© 2021 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.",Cryosphere,10.5194/tc-15-1931-2021,7,3,No,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Kenya, Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASAL) occupy 80% of the landscape and are critical for the livelihoods of millions of pastoralists. However, they have been invaded by Invasive Plant Species (IPS) thereby compromising their ecosystem functionality. Opuntia stricta, a well-known IPS, has invaded the ASAL in Kenya and poses a threat to pastoralism, leading to livestock mortality and land degradation. Thus, identification and detailed estimation of its cover is essential for drawing an effective management strategy. The study aimed at utilizing the Sentinel-2 multispectral sensor to detect Opuntia stricta in a heterogeneous ASAL in Laikipia County, using ensemble machine learning classifiers. To illustrate the potential of Sentinel-2, the detection of Opuntia stricta was based on only the spectral bands as well as in combination with vegetation and topographic indices using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to detect the abundance. Study results showed that the overall accuracies of Sentinel 2 spectral bands were 80% and 84.4%, while that of combined spectral bands, vegetation, and topographic indices was 89.2% and 92.4% for XGBoost and RF classifiers, respectively. The inclusion of topographic indices that enhance characterization of biological processes, and vegetation indices that minimize the influence of soil and the effects of atmosphere, contributed by improving the accuracy of the classification. Qualitatively, Opuntia stricta spatially was found along river banks, flood plains, and near settlements but limited in forested areas. Our results demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 multispectral sensors to effectively detect and map Opuntia stricta in a complex heterogeneous ASAL, which can support conservation and rangeland management policies that aim to map and list threatened areas, and conserve the biodiversity and productivity of rangeland ecosystems.

Species composition and diversity are key parameters for assessing the health of forest ecosystem, and the loss of species diversity often accelerates degradation of structure and function of forest ecosystem. Therefore, accurately monitoring species composition and spatio-temporal distribution of mangrove forest are helpful for timely and effective management and restoration measures, which can further retain the quality of the mangrove ecosystem and biodiversity. The traditional means of obtaining mangrove species information requires time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly field survey, however, it is difficult to further understand the continuous distribution of forest health. In contrast, remote sensing technology is more cost-effective and can achieve spatially continuous monitoring of mangrove species composition and health status. With the fast-developing fine-resolution multispectral satellites, the images are used for classifying mangrove species due to their rich spatial geometric information. However, compared to multispectral images that contain limited spectral information, hyperspectral data are more effective for tree species discrimination or classification due to hundreds or even thousands of continuous bands that can reflect vegetation functional traits (e.g. pigment content, specific leaf area and nitrogen content). Moreover, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point cloud can acquire details related to three-dimensional features of the vegetation structure. Traditionally, there are many data dimension reduction or feature extraction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA). However, these methods should combine with other classifiers in classification of plant species. To improve the classification accuracy and efficiency, this paper introduces a new machine learning method with both feature selection and classification functions-eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The rapidly growing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and portable sensors of hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR have provided higher quality remote sensing data. UAV-based remote sensing data can derive massive features of spectra, texture and structure, therefore, how to extract dominant features is a key issue to improve the efficiency and accuracy of mangrove species classification. With UAV-based hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR point cloud of the buffer area in Shenzhen Futian Mangrove Nature Reserve, this study aims to extract eight types of dominant features suitable for mangrove species classification using ""feature_importance"" property of XGBoost. The dominant features include: single feature derived from UAV-based hyperspectral imagery (spectral bands, vegetation indices and texture: F1-F3) and their fused feature (F4), single feature derived from UAV-based LiDAR point cloud (height and intensity feature: F5, F6) and their fused feature (F7), and fused feature coupling hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR point cloud. Synthetically considering species classification accuracy and mapping results, the classification model based on F8 feature held the best performance (overall accuracy was 96.41%, Moran's I was 0.5520). The classification performance based on fused feature of single data source (F4 and F7, overall accuracy was separately 96.74% and 90.64%) was superior than that of single feature (F1-F3, F5 and F6, overall accuracy was 90.31%, 92.20%, 91.96%, 87.66% and 81.99% respectively). The Moran's I of classification maps based on fused feature (F4, F7 and F8) and texture feature (F3) were greater than that of single feature (F1, F2, F5 and F6). Moreover, mangrove species classification models based on different dominant features have their own advantages on spatial mapping. The introduction of F3 effectively solved the common salt-and-pepper effect in the mapping results based on F1 and F2; moreover, the salt-and-pepper effect in the edge of classification images (near tidal flat area) was significantly improved in the mapping results based on F5, F7 and F8. We conclude that: (1) The combination of UAV-based remote sensing data and XGBoost is feasible to pixel-oriented accurate classification of mangrove species, the fusion feature of UAV-based hyperspectral image and LiDAR point cloud has the best classification effect when comprehensively comparing classification accuracy (OA) and mapping effect (Moran's I); (2) when fusing the different types of features derived from UAV-based hyperspectral or LiDAR data alone, the corresponding classification accuracy and mapping effect behaved better than the single feature derived from the same UAV data source; (3) XGBoost, a machine learning method with both feature selection and classification functions, has great potential in remote sensing image classification; (4) the intensity features derived from LiDAR point clouds are greatly affected by UAV flight strips, however, the height features are robust in mangrove species classification. Future research will focus on unmixing of hyperspectral data, fuzzy classification and radiation transfer models (such as PROSAIL) to improve the accuracy and interpretability of mangrove species classification. This paper demonstrated the feasibility of UAV-based remote sensing data and XGBoost in the pixel-oriented precise classification of mangrove species, which can provide scientific basis and technical support for three-dimensional monitoring of health, conservation and restoration for mangrove ecosystem.

Besides, the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) was chosen for comparison with Luojia1-01. The ten-folded cross-validation (CV) has been used for evaluating accuracy at county and city scales. Finally, the distribution maps of socio-economic parameters were illustrated and some findings were obtained. First, the validation results revealed that the calibration at the city-scale outperformed the county or district scale. Second, the precision of the Luojia1-01 NTL dataset surpassed the NPP-VIIRS NTL dataset on the same administrative scale except for some specific situations. Third, the precision of the simulation for the gross domestic product (GDP) is the highest than the others, followed by electric consumption (EC), build-up area (B-A), and population (POP). Fourth, the optimum model varied according to the socio-economic parameters. Fifth, the distribution of socio-economic parameters exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity.

We investigated the use of both hydrologic and social demographic data for flood exposure mapping with Random Forest (RF) regression and classification algorithms trained to predict both parcel- and tract-level flood insurance claims within New York State, US. Topographic characteristics best described flood claim frequency, but RF prediction skill was improved at both spatial scales when socioeconomic data was incorporated. Substantial improvements occurred at the tract-level when the percentage of minority residents, housing stock value and age, and the political dissimilarity index of voting precincts were used to predict insurance claims. Census tracts with higher numbers of claims and greater densities of low-lying tax parcels tended to have low proportions of minority residents, newer houses, and less political similarity to state level government. We compared this data-driven approach and a physically-based pluvial flood routing model for prediction of the spatial extents of flooding claims in two nearby catchments of differing land use. The floodplain we defined with physically based modeling agreed well with existing federal flood insurance rate maps, but underestimated the spatial extents of historical claim generating areas. In contrast, RF classification incorporating hydrologic and socioeconomic demographic data likely overestimated the flood-exposed areas. Our research indicates that quantitative incorporation of social data can improve flooding exposure estimates.

We explore these methods using a case study of Folsom Reservoir, California, using control policies structured as binary trees, and streamflow resampling based on the paleo-inflow record.

The proposed framework consists of three main stages: (i) deriving a water depth map through a geomorphic method based on a supervised linear binary classification; (ii) generating an exposure land-use map developed from multi-spectral Landsat 8 satellite images using a machine-learning classification algorithm; and (iii) performing a flood damage assessment using a GIS tool, based on the vulnerability (depth-damage) curves method. The proposed integrated method was applied over the entire country of Romania (including minor order basins) for a 100-year return time at 30-m resolution. The results showed how the description of flood risk may especially benefit from the ability of the proposed cost-efficient model to carry out large-scale analyses in data-scarce environments. This approach may help in performing and updating risk assessments and management, taking into account the temporal and spatial changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Â© 2020 by the authors.

In the current paper, commonly used satellite imagery from the public domain for flood inundated extent capturing are studied considering Can Tho City as a study area. The differences in the flood inundated areas from different satellite sensors and the possible reasons are explored. An effective and relatively advanced method to address the uncertainties-inundated area capture from different remote sensing sensors-was implemented while establishing the inundated area pattern between the years 2000 and 2018. This solution involves the usage of a machine learning technique, Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) which further helps in filling the gaps whenever there is lack of data from a single satellite data source. This useful method could be extended to establish the inundated area patterns over the years in data-sparse regions and in areas where access is difficult.

In hydrology, this issue is commonly addressed by utilizing regression or similarity-based regionalization techniques. The core of similarity-based regionalization techniques is a physical/climatic similarity metric that is typically predetermined from the knowledge about the physics of the problem and study area. The purpose of this paper is to: (1) reduce the subjectivity that exists in the selection of the physical/climatic similarity metric by establishing a systematic approach, and (2) propose a generic similarity-based regionalization framework that estimates the parameters of environmental models in data-scarce regions. The efficacy of the proposed framework is evaluated for the regionalization of a statistical model that creates probabilistic floodplain maps in data-scarce regions.

Machine learning (ML) models have become widely prevalent in capturing the complexity of reservoir inflow time-series data. However, the model structure's selection required several trails-and-error processes to identify the optimal architecture to capture the necessary information of various patterns of input-output mapping. In this study, the effectiveness of a deep learning (DL) approach in capturing various input-output patterns is examined and applied to reservoir inflow forecasting. The proposed DL approach has a distinct benefit over classical ML models as all the hidden layers are stacked afterward to train on a diverging set of topologies derived from the previous layer's output. Given the nonlinearity of day-to-day data about reservoir inflow, a deep learning algorithm centered on the long short-term memory (LSTM) and two standard machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), were deployed in this study for forecasting reservoir inflow on a daily basis. The gathered data pertained to historical daily inflow from 01/01/2018 to 31/12/2019. The area of study was Durian Tunggal Reservoir, Melaka, Peninsular Malaysia. The choice of the input set was made on the basis of the autocorrelation function. The formulated model was assessed on the basis of statistical indices, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The outcomes indicate that the LSTM model performed much better than SVM and ANN. Based on the comparison, LSTM outperformed other models with MAE = 0.088, RMSE = 0.27, and R-2 = 0.91. This research demonstrates that the deep learning technique is an appropriate method for estimating the daily inflow of the Durian Tunggal Reservoir, unlike the standard machine learning models.",NATURAL HAZARDS,10.1007/s11069-021-04839-x,8,3,No,"Iraq,Malaysia,U Arab Emirates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent decades, deep learning has been applied to water extraction but is subject to the large difficulty of acquiring SAR dataset of various water bodies types, as well as heavy labeling work. In addition, the traditional methods mostly occur over the large, open lakes and rivers, rarely focusing on complex areas such as the urban water, and cannot automatically acquire the classification threshold. To address these issues, a novel water extraction method is proposed with high accuracy in this paper. Firstly, a multiscale feature extraction using a Gabor filter is conducted to reduce the noise and roughly identify water feature. Secondly, we apply the Otsu algorithm as well as a voting strategy to initially extract the homogeneous regions and for subsequent Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Finally, the dual threshold is obtained from the fitted Gaussian distribution of water and non-water, which is integrated into the graph cut model to redefine the weights of the edges, then constructing the energy function of the water map. The dual-threshold graph cut (DTGC) model precisely pinpoints the water location by minimizing the energy function. To verify the efficiency and robustness, our method and comparison methods, including the IGC method and IACM method, are tested on six different types of water bodies, by performing the accuracy assessment via comparing outcomes with the manually labeled ground truth. The qualitative and quantitative results show that the overall accuracy of our method for the whole dataset all surpasses 99%, along with an obvious improvement of the Kappa, F1-score, and IoU indicators. Therefore, DTGC method has the absolute advantage of automatically capturing water maps in different scenes of SAR images without specific prior knowledge and can also determine the optimal threshold range.",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs13173465,7,3,No,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accuracy of the data set is evaluated on observed river flow from basins not used for model calibration and is found to compare favorably against state-of-the-art global hydrological model simulations. The G-RUN ENSEMBLE estimates the global mean runoff volume to range between 3.2 x 10(4) and 3.8 x 10(4) km(3) yr(-1).

Insight into this fine scale of ecosystem functioning is also important as far as minimizing errors in upscaling are concerned. The realisation of high-resolution ground surveys of these mudflats without perturbing their surface is a real challenge. Here, we address this challenge using UAV-supported photogrammetry based on the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) workflow. We produced a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophotograph at 1 cm and 0.5 cm pixel resolutions, respectively, of a mudflat in French Guiana, and mapped and classed into different size ranges intricate morphological features, including crab burrow apertures, tidal drainage creeks and depressions. We also determined subtle facies and elevation changes and slopes, and the footprint of different degrees of benthic biofilm development. The results generated at this scale of photogrammetric analysis also enabled us to relate macrofaunal crab burrowing activity to various parameters, including mudflat elevation, spatial distribution and sizes of creeks and depressions, benthic biofilm distribution, and flooding duration. SfM photogrammetry offers interesting new perspectives in fine-scale characterisation of the geomorphology, benthic activity and degree of biofilm development of dynamic muddy intertidal environments that are generally difficult of access. The main shortcomings highlighted in this study are a drift of accuracy of the DSM outside areas of ground control points and the deployment of which perturb the mudflat morphology and biology, the water-logged or very wet surfaces which generate reconstruction artefacts through the sun glint effect, and the time-consuming task of manual interpretation of extraction of features such as crab burrow apertures. On-going developments in UAV positioning integrating RTK/PPK GPS solutions for image-georeferencing and precise orientation with high-quality inertial measurement units will limit the difficulties inherent to ground control points, while conduction of surveys during homogeneous cloudy conditions could reduce the sun-glint effect.

To this end, we used some data-driven models and techniques such as multi-criteria decision analysis, bivariate statistical method, machine learning, and sub-watershed prioritization by morphometric analysis (SWPMA) in the Kaljani River basin for the flood susceptibility mapping (FSM). The study used 200 non-flood points and 200 historical flood points for developing the testing (30%) and training (70%) datasets. Multicollinearity diagnostic test (VIF) and information gain ratio (IGR) were used to measure the consistency of the selected twelve influencing factors. Rainfall, drainage density, clay content, distance from the river and elevation were the most important drivers of the selected influencing parameters. We found that the high and very high FSM areas of the basin were around 32.24% for random forest (RF), 47.46% for frequency ratio (FR), 46.41% for analytical hierarchic process (AHP), and 40.5% for SWPMA. Most of these areas lie in Alipurduar town surrounding areas and the lower part of the basin.

Water, however, is an ornery object in image processing, as it can be found in different forms and colors in nature. This makes the detection, classification, and tracking of water in images and videos difficult for computer vision models. There are still visual differences resulting from water texture and its inherent optical properties associated with different waterbodies which can be recognized and extracted to support computer models to better analyze water images. This study aims to utilize a set of early, mid-level, and high-level vision techniques, including Gabor kernels, local binary patterns (LBPs), and deep learning (DL) models to extract and analyze water texture and color of different waterbodies in digital images. For this purpose, ATLANTIS TeXture (ATeX), an image dataset for waterbodies classification and texture analysis, was used. Models were trained for the task of classification on ATeX. Then, the performance of each model in extracting texture features was evaluated and compared. Results showed that the classification accuracy achieved by the Gabor magnitude tensor, LBP, and DL model (ShuffleNet V2 Ã 1.0) are 29, 35, and 92%, respectively, and thus the DL model outperforms traditional vision-based techniques. Moreover, the classification results on raw images represented by different color spaces (e.g., RGB, HSV, etc.) emphasized the importance of color information for digital image processing of water. Analyzing representative visual features and properties of different water types and waterbodies can facilitate designing a customized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for water scenes, as CNNs recognize objects through the analysis of both texture and shape clues and their relationship in the entire field of view.

Multi-hazard susceptibility maps can be used by land-use manager to guide urban development, to minimize the risk of natural disasters. The objective of the present study was to use four machine learning models to produce multi-hazard susceptibility maps in Khuzestan Province, Iran. In this work, four different natural hazards (flood, landslides, forest fire, and earthquake) using support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT), random forest (RF), and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) techniques were created. Effective factors used in the study include elevation, slope degree, slopeÂ aspect, rainfall, temperature, lithology, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), wind exposition index (WEI), topographic wetness index (TWI), plan curvature, drainage density, distance from roads, distance from rivers, and distance from villages. The spatial earthquake hazard in the study area was derived from a peak ground acceleration (PGA) susceptibility map. The second step in the study was to combine the model-generated maps of the four hazards in a reliable multi-hazard map.

Mapping the susceptibility to flooding is essential for the effective management of flood risk. This paper aims to propose and evaluate four new hybrid models. The Spercheios river basin in Greece was chosen as a case study. The ensemble Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms were combined with the statistical methods of Frequency Ratio (FR) and Weight of Evidence (WoE). The models optimized by the metaheuristic Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) method. Flood inventory of the study (564 locations) developed by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and flood archive. Flood locations associated with twelve conditioning factors and the dataset randomly split into training and testing sets (70%-30%). Feature selection was performed using the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) method. Input data for the training of the models were the results of FR and WoE. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and statistical metrics were carried out for the validation of the models. It was proved that all models had an AUC value>0.95 and the most precise model was WoE-RF-ABC (AUC = 0.9675). Variable importance of factors showed agricultural lowlands and artificial areas are more likely to be flooded. This study showed that these four optimized hybrid models could accurately predict flood areas prone to flooding and help the decision-makers.

The increased anthropogenic activities in weak geological areas have led to a rise in the frequency of landslides, making landslide management an urgent task to minimize the negative impact. This study aimed to use hyper-tuned machine learning and deep learning algorithms to predict landslide susceptibility model (LSM) and provide sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in Aqabat Al-Sulbat Asir region of Saudi Arabia. Methods: Random forest (RF) was used as the machine learning model, while deep neural network (DNN) was used as the deep learning model. The models were hyper-tuned using the grid search technique, and the best hypertuned models were used for predicting LSM. The generated models were validated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC), F1 and F2 scores, gini value, and precision and recall curve. The DNN based sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was conducted to analyze the influence and uncertainty of the parameters to the landslide. Results: Results showed that the RF and DNN models predicted 35.1â41.32 and 15.14â16.2 km2 areas as high and very high landslide susceptibility zones, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of ROC curve showed that the LSM by the DNN model achieved 0.96 of AUC, while the LSM by RF model achieved 0.93 of AUC. The sensitivity analysis results showed that rainfall had the highest sensitivity to the landslide, followed by Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), curvature, slope, soil texture, and lineament density. Discussion: Road density and geology map had the highest uncertainty to the landslide prediction. This study may be helpful to the authorities and stakeholders in proposing management plans for landslides by considering potential areas for landslide and sensitive parameters.

While large-scale climate patterns such as teleconnections and climate change become important at this scale, it remains a challenge to represent the local hydrological cycle over various watersheds in a manner that is physically consistent with climate. As a result, global models tend to suffer from a lack of available scenarios and flexibility that are key for planners, relief organizations, regulators, and the financial services industry to analyze the socioeconomic, demographic, and climatic factors affecting exposure. Here we introduce a data-driven, global, fast, flexible, and climate-consistent flood risk modeling framework for applications that do not necessarily require high-resolution flood mapping. We use statistical and machine learning methods to examine the relationship between historical flood occurrence and impact from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (1985â2017), and climatic, watershed, and socioeconomic factors for 4,734 HydroSHEDS watersheds globally. Using bias-corrected output from the NCAR CESM Large Ensemble (1980â2020), and the fitted statistical relationships, we simulate 1 million years of events worldwide along with the population displaced in each event. We discuss potential applications of the model and present global flood hazard and risk maps. The main value of this global flood model lies in its ability to quickly simulate realistic flood events at a resolution that is useful for large-scale socioeconomic and financial planning, yet we expect it to be useful to climate and natural hazard scientists who are interested in socioeconomic impacts of climate.

The Vembanad lake system (VLS) in Kerala, India, has faced adverse mishappening during 2018, 2019, and 2021 floods in the state due to torrential rainfall. The goal of this research is to construct effective decision tree-based machine learning models such as adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for integrating data, processing, and generating flood susceptibility maps. There are 18 conditioning parameters considered, which include seven categories and 11 numerical data. These seven categorical data were converted to numerical data, bringing the total amount of input data to 61. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) was utilized as the feature selection technique, and a total of 22 layers were chosen to feed into the machine learning models to generate the flood susceptibility maps. The efficiencies of the models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-area under the ROC curve (AUC), F1 score, accuracy, and kappa. According to the results, the performance of all four models demonstrated their practical application; however, XGBoost fared well in terms of the model's metrics.

A case study in northern China was applied to test the model performance, and the results clearly showed that the model can accurately predict the maximum water depths and flood time series for various hyetograph inputs, with substantial improvements in the computation time. The model predicted flood maps 19 585 times faster than the physically based hydrodynamic model and achieved a mean relative error of 9.5 %. For retrieving the spatial patterns of water depths, the degree of similarity of the flood maps was very high. In a best case scenario, the difference between the ground truth and model prediction was only 0.76 %, and the spatial distributions of inundated paths and areas were almost identical. With the adoption of transfer learning, the proposed model was well applied to a new case study and showed robust compatibility and generalization ability. Our model was further compared with two baseline prediction algorithms (artificial neural network and convolutional neural network) to validate the model superiority.

Most of them are supervised techniques, which usually require large amounts of training data and are limited to a particular application. Self-supervised methods solve these problems and are widely used in unsupervised binary change detection tasks. However, the existing self-supervised methods in change detection are suboptimal for pixel-wise change detection tasks. In this work, a pixel-wise contrastive approach is proposed to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by using contrastive loss in superpixel-level features on an unlabeled multiview setting. In this approach, a pseudo-Siamese network is trained to obtain pixel-wise representations and to align features from shifted image pairs. The final binary change map is obtained by using thresholding methods on learned temporal features. To overcome the season-related noise in binary change maps, we also used an uncertainty method to enhance the temporal robustness of the proposed approach.

This research combines information received from ground observed data derived from road closure reports from the police department, with remotely sensed satellite imagery to develop and train machine?learning models for flood detection for the City of San Diego, CA, USA. For this purpose, flooding information are extracted from Sentinel 1 satellite imagery and fed into various supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), to detect flooded pixels in images and evaluate the performance of these ML models. Moreover, a new unsupervised machine learning framework is developed which works based on the change detection (CD) approach and combines the Otsu algorithm, fuzzy rules, and iso?clustering methods for urban flood detection. Results from the performance evaluation of RF, SVM, MLC and CD models show 0.53, 0.85, 0.75 and 0.81 precision measures, 0.9, 0.85, 0.85 and 0.9 for recall values, 0.67, 0.85, 0.79 and 0.85 for the F1?score, and 0.69, 0.87, 0.83 and 0.87 for the accuracy measure, respectively, for each model.

Firstly, the coarse results of the water body were generated by the binary segmentation of GF-3 SAR, the water indexes of GF-1/6 multispectral, and Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral images. Secondly, the fine results were achieved by the deep neural networks with noisy-label learning. More specifically, the Unet with the T-revision is adopted as the noisy label learning method. The results demonstrated the reliability and accuracy of water mapping retrieved by the noisy learning method. Finally, the differences in flooding patterns in different regions were also revealed.

The experimental evaluation shows the highest intersection over union (IOU) of 0.8623 for the DeepLabV3+ and, therefore, is recommended for the regional and large-scale DCG mapping. Moreover, GlacierNet's CNN with the second-highest IOU of 0.8599 is a suitable and light structure for regional DCG mapping.

In this study, we investigated the utility of transfer learning (TL) to improve urban flood susceptibility assessment using knowledge outside the training domain. Specifically, we pre-trained a convolutional neural network-based assessment model in one catchment and then tried to improve the model performance of two other catchments by transferring knowledge from the pre-trained model. The results showed that (1) with the help of TL, the model performance of the two transferred catchments improved by 10%â25% in different data-rich and data-sparse scenarios; and (2) TL typically provided positive effects when we transferred knowledge from a well pretrained model in data-rich catchment. However, it may induce negative effects when the pre-trained model has poor accuracy. This study provides a promising approach to improve ML-based hazard assessment by sharing knowledge from different regions.

Rapid assessments of flooded areas are key for effective mitigation strategies and disaster risk plans, as well as to prepare operative policies for future events. Herein, we present an integrated methodology for rapidly mapping the flood extent, and depths based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and a digital elevation model (DEM). Incessant rain during August 2019 brought heavy riverine flooding in southern India, killed at least 280 people, and displaced about one million inhabitants from low-lying areas. We used SAR images by Sentinel-1 before, and during the flooding, and the MERIT DEM which enabled us to map the flood extent and flood depth of the inundation zones. Because the coverage of Sentinel-1 scene was limited to the Kabini river section during the flood period, flood extent and depth maps for the adjacent basin was generated by mapping the susceptibility for flooding using the training set obtained from the flood time Sentinel-1 images, and a set of predictive variables derived from DEM using random forest model. Qualitative analysis and cross-comparison with a numerical flood model proved the proposed approach is highly reliable with an accuracy value of 90% and 86% respectively for training and validation data, thus allowing a precise, simple, and fast flood mapping. The methodology presented here could be applied to other flooded areas having incomplete inventory in the context of flood risk assessment.

Accurate and timely delineation of flood inundated areas is essential for disaster assessment and mitigation. There have been significant advances in flood mapping using remote sensing images in recent years, but little attention has been devoted to outburst flood mapping. The short?duration nature of these events and observation constraints from cloud cover have significantly challenged outburst flood mapping. This study used the outburst flood of the Baige landslide dam on the Jinsha River on 3 November 2018 as an example to propose a new flood mapping method that combines optical images from Sentinel?2, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Sentinel?1 and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). First, in the cloud?free region, a comparison of four spectral indexes calculated from time series of Sentinel?2 images indicated that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the threshold of 0.15 provided the best separation flooded area. Subsequently, in the cloud?covered region, an analysis of dualpolarization RGB false color composites images and backscattering coefficient differences of Sentinel?1 SAR data were found an apparent response to ground roughnessâs changes caused by the flood. We carried out the flood range prediction model based on the random forest algorithm. Training samples consisted of 13 feature vectors obtained from the Hue?Saturation?Value color space, backscattering coefficient differences/ratio, DEM data, and a label set from the flood range prepared from Sentinel?2 images. Finally, a field investigation and confusion matrix tested the prediction accuracy of the end?of?flood map. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 92.3%, 0.89 respectively. The full extent of the outburst floods was successfully obtained within five days of its occurrence. The multi?source data merging framework and the massive sample preparation method with SAR images proposed in this paper, provide a practical demonstration for similar machine learning applications using remote sensing.

In particular, Quang Binh province is often affected by floods and storms over the year. However, it still lacks studies on flood hazard estimation and prediction tools in this area. This study aims to develop a flooding susceptibility assessment tool using various machine learning (ML) techniques namely alternating decision tree (AD Tree), logistic model tree (LM Tree), reduced-error pruning tree (REP Tree), J48 decision tree (J48) and NaÃ¯ve Bayes tree (NB Tree); historical flood marks; and available data of topography, hydrology, geology, and environment considering Quang Binh province as a study area. We used flood mark locations of major flooding events in the years 2007, 2010, and 2016; and ten flood conditioning factors to construct and validate the ML models. Various validation methods, including area under the ROC curve (AUC), were used to validate and compare the models. The result of the modelsâ validation suggests that all models have good performance: AD Tree (AUC = 0.968), LM Tree (AUC = 0.967), REP Tree (AUC = 0.897), J48 (AUC = 0.953), and NB Tree (AUC = 0.986). Out of these, NB Tree managed to achieve the best performance in terms of flood prediction with an accuracy higher than 92 %.

Mapping the probability of flash flood events remains challenges because of its complexity and rapid onset of precipitation. Thus, this study aims to propose a state-of-the-art data mining approach based on a hybrid equilibrium optimized SysFor, namely, the HE-SysFor model, for spatial prediction of flash floods. A tropical storm region located in the Northwest areas of Vietnam is selected as a case study. For this purpose, 1866 flash-flooded locations and ten indicators were used. The results show that the proposed HE-SysFor model yielded the highest predictive performance (total accuracy = 93.8%, Kappa index = 0.875, F1-score = 0.939, and AUC = 0.975) and produced the better performance than those of the C4.5 decision tree (C4.5), the radial basis function-based support vector machine (SVM-RBF), the logistic regression (LReg), and deep learning neural network (DeepLNN) models in both the training and the testing phases. Among the ten indicators, elevation, slope, and land cover are the most important. It is concluded that the proposed model provides an alternative tool and may help for effectively monitoring flash floods in tropical areas and robust policies for decision making in mitigating the flash flood impacts.

Furthermore, the application of machine learning has been valuable for the identification of damaged buildings. However, the performance of machine learning depends on the number and quality of training data, which is scarce in the aftermath of a large scale disaster. To address this issue, we propose the use of fragmentary but reliable news media photographs at the time of a disaster and use them to detect the whole extent of the flooded buildings. As an experimental test, the flood occurred in the town of Mabi, Japan, in 2018 is used. Five hand-engineered features were extracted from SAR images acquired before and after the disaster. The training data were collected based on news photos. The date release of the photographs were considered to assess the potential role of news information as a source of training data. Then, a discriminant function was calibrated using the training data and the support vector machine method. We found that news information taken within 24 h of a disaster can classify flooded and nonflooded buildings with about 80% accuracy. The results were also compared with a standard unsupervised learning method and confirmed that training data generated from news media photographs improves the accuracy obtained from unsupervised classification methods. We also provide a discussion on the potential role of news media as a source of reliable information to be used as training data and other activities associated to early disaster response.

This part of the MGP, which is in the central Ganga River Basin (GRB), is experiencing worse floods in the changing climatic scenario causing an increased level of loss of life and property. The MGP experiencing monsoonal subtropical humid climate, active tectonics induced ground subsidence, increasing population, and shifting landuse/landcover trends and pattern, is the best natural laboratory to test all the susceptibility prediction genre of models to achieve the choice of best performing model with the constant number of input parameters for this type of topoclimatic environmental setting. This will help in achieving the goal of model universality, i.e., finding out the best performing susceptibility prediction model for this type of topoclimatic setting with the similar number and type of input variables. Based on the highly accurate flood inventory and using 12 flood predictors (FPs) (selected using field experience of the study area and literature survey), two machine learning (ML) ensemble models developed by bagging frequency ratio (FR) and evidential belief function (EBF) with classification and regression tree (CART), CART-FR and CART-EBF, were applied for flood susceptibility zonation mapping. Flood and non-flood points randomly generated using flood inventory have been apportioned in 70:30 ratio for training and validation of the ensembles. Based on the evaluation performance using threshold-independent evaluation statistic, area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, 14 threshold-dependent evaluation metrices, and seed cell area index (SCAI) meant for assessing different aspects of ensembles, the study suggests that CART-EBF (AUCSR = 0.843; AUCPR = 0.819) was a better performant than CART-FR (AUCSR = 0.828; AUCPR = 0.802). The variability in performances of these novel-advanced ensembles and their comparison with results of other published models espouse the need of testing these as well as other genres of susceptibility models in other topoclimatic environments also.

Due to the lack of hydrological and meteorological information and disaster event inventory in Xinjiang, China, storm flood disaster (SFD) risk zoning is an effective technique in investigating the potential impact of SFD. In this study, the statistics about natural, social, and risk related to SFD are collated. With the help of the compiled inventory data, a disaster risk assessment model for storm flood is proposed for the Xinjiang region based on the random forest (RF) algorithm. Randomly selected negative and positive samples from the historical SFD locations are composed of five different total samples. The overall prediction accuracy of the five sample groups attained 83.48%, indicating that the proposed RF model can well capture the spatial distribution of SFD in Xinjiang. It should also be noted that the spatial heterogeneity and complexity of SFD had a significant effect on its spatial distribution in Xinjiang. There are spatial distribution characteristics of lowland plains and high plateaus; the main mountainous regions, plains in the middle-lower reaches of major rivers, and areas surrounding major lakes are prone to flooding. The variable importance RF indicates that the disaster risk is mainly affected by the following factors, including hazard factors, catastrophic intensity, population density, as well as economic development in the affected area. Besides, latitude, longitude, agricultural acreage, road density, distance from rivers, and the maximum monthly precipitation account for most of the increase in storm flooding disasters, and they are the main triggering point for SFD in Xinjiang. The proposed model provides some insight into the disaster in the mountainous region, and gives useful guidance for the national macro-control of flood prevention and disaster reduction.

To analyse the collinearity among factors and to scrutinize each variable's predictive power, multicollinearity test and Information Gain Ratio were applied, respectively. After training, the models were evaluated on various statistical measures and compared with benchmark models. Results revealed that the proposed ensemble model outperformed Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and produced a precise and accurate map. Results of ensemble model showed 99% accuracy in training and 98% accuracy in testing datasets. This ensemble model can be used by flood management authorities and the government to contribute to future research studies.

In terms of the management of the environment and water resources, precise identification is required of areas susceptible to flooding to support planners in implementing effective prevention strategies. The objective of this study is to develop a novel hybrid approach based on Bald Eagle Search (BES), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Bagging (BA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to generate a flood susceptibility map in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. In total, 1621 flood points and 14 predictor variables were used in this study. These data were divided into 60% for model training, 20% for model validation and 20% for testing. In addition, various statistical indices were used to evaluate the performance of the model, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Receiver Operation Characteristics (ROC), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results show that BES, for the first time, successfully improved the performance of individual models in building a flood susceptibility map in Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam, namely SVM, RF, BA and MLP, with high accuracy (AUC > 0.9). Among the models proposed, BA-BES was most effective with AUC = 0.998, followed by RF-BES (AUC = 0.998), MLP-BES (AUC = 0.998), and SVM-BES (AUC = 0.99).

In recent years, flood damage has increased due to human intervention and land use and climate changes. The purpose of this study is to predict flood susceptibility in Tafresh watershed in Markazi Province, Iran based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Extremely Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning models and evaluate the performance of hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method and XGB model. For this purpose, 14 independent variables affecting flood susceptibility were prepared, also, 227 flood locations were identified as independent variables based on available information and field survey. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the models, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) parameters were used. Evaluating the efficiency of the models based on the AUCs of testing dataset showed the higher efficiency of the GA-XGB hybrid model in modeling flood susceptibility in the Tafresh watershed is compared to KNN and XGB models, and the AUC in KNN, XGB, and GA-XGB models are 0.82, 0.85, and 0.87, respectively. So using the genetic algorithm as an optimizer for determining the best parameters in the XGB model increases efficiency in this model. The results of determining the relative importance of independent variables in flood susceptibility modeling showed that the independent variables considered in each model have different effects. Distance from road and distance from river in all three models had significant importance in modeling flood hazard in the Tafresh watershed. The optimization method in this study can be used as a powerful method in other spatial modeling studies. The results of this study also support management programs to reduce flood risks in the study area.

However, many developing countries lack sufficiently detailed data to produce reliable risk maps with existing methods. Thus, improved methods are needed that can help managers and decision makers to combine existing data with more soft semi-subjective data, such as citizen observations of flood-prone and vulnerable areas in view of existing settlements. Thus, we present an innovative approach using the semi-subjective Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which integrates both subjective and objective assessments, to help organize the problem framework. This approach involves measuring the consistency of decision makersâ judgments, generating pairwise comparisons for choosing a solution, and considering criteria and subcriteria to evaluate possible options. An urban flood-risk map was created according to the vulnerabilities and hazards of different urban areas using classification and regression-tree models, and the map can serve both as a first stage in advancing flood-risk mitigation approaches and in allocating warning and forecasting systems. The findings show that machine-learning methods are efficient in urban flood zoning. Using the city Rasht in Iran, it is shown that distance to rivers, urban drainage density, and distance to vulnerable areas are the most significant parameters that influence flood hazards. Similarly, for urban flood vulnerability, population density, land use, dwelling quality, household income, distance to cultural heritage, and distance to medical centers and hospitals are the most important factors. The integrated technique for both objective and semi-subjective data as outlined in the present study shows credible results that can be obtained without complicated modeling and costly field surveys. The proposed method is especially helpful in areas with little data to describe and display flood hazards to managers and decision makers. Â© 2022 by the authors.

At the same time, SDNs constitute an attractive target for cyber attackers due to their global network view and programmability. One of the major vulnerabilities of typical SDN architectures is their susceptibility to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attacks. DDoS flooding attacks can render SDN controllers unavailable to their underlying infrastructure, causing service disruption or a complete outage in many cases. In this paper, machine learning-based detection and classification of DDoS flooding attacks on SDNs is investigated using popular machine learning (ML) algorithms. The ML algorithms, classifiers and methods investigated are quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes (GNB), k -nearest neighbor (k-NN), and classification and regression tree (CART). The general principle is illustrated through a case study, in which, experimental data (i.e. jitter, throughput, and response time metrics) from a representative SDN architecture suitable for typical mid-sized enterprise-wide networks is used to build classification models that accurately identify and classify DDoS flooding attacks. The SDN model used was emulated in Mininet and the DDoS flooding attacks (i.e. hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), transmission control protocol (TCP), and user datagram protocol (UDP) attacks) have been launched on the SDN model using low orbit ion cannon (LOIC). Although all the ML methods investigated show very good efficacy in detecting and classifying DDoS flooding attacks, CART demonstrated the best performance on average in terms of prediction accuracy (98%), prediction speed ( 5.3,,{times },,10{5} observations per second), training time (12.4 ms), and robustness.

The timely, accurate mapping of the flooded areas is an important task. Therefore, an unsupervised approach is proposed for automated flooded area mapping from bi-temporal Sentinel-2 multispectral images in this paper. First, spatialâspectral features of the images before and after the flood are extracted to construct the change magnitude image (CMI). Then, the certain flood pixels and non-flood pixels are obtained by performing uncertainty analysis on the CMI, which are considered reliable classification samples. Next, Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is used as the core classifier to generate the initial flood map. Finally, an easy-to-implement two-stage post-processing is proposed to reduce the mapping error of the initial flood map, and generate the final flood map. Different from other methods based on machine learning, GRNN is used as the classifier, but the proposed approach is automated and unsupervised because it uses samples automatically generated in uncertainty analysis for model training. Results of comparative experiments in the three sub-regions of the Poyang Lake Basin demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. Moreover, its superiority in dealing with uncertain pixels is further proven by comparing the classification accuracy of different methods on uncertain pixels.

The aim of this study was to utilize high spatial resolution drone and WorldView-4 satellite data to map and monitor grazing land cover change and pasture quality pre-and post-flooding. The grazing land cover was mapped pre-flooding using WorldView-4 satellite data and post-flooding using real-time drone data.

Therefore, numerical simulation and probabilistic models have been used for flood prediction, but the methodologies for real-time flood prediction by drainage district in metropolitan areas are still not sufficient. In this study, a flood scenario database was established by using one- and two-dimensional hydraulic analysis models to propose a realtime urban flood prediction method by drainage districts in metropolitan areas. Flood prediction models were constructed for each drainage district through the Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs and Self-Organizing Map (NARX-SOM). Suggested prediction model is a data-driven model because it is based on flood database which composed with diverse flood simulation results. To evaluate the predictive capacity of the models, flood prediction was performed for the actual heavy rainfall in 2010 and 2011 that caused severe flooding in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Flood prediction models for a total of 24 drainage districts were constructed, and it was found that the goodness of fit on the flood area ranged from 68.7 to 89.7%. In terms of the expected inundation map, the predictive power was found to be high when the SOM result with 5 Ã 5 dimension was mainly used. Through this study, it was possible to identify the predictive capability of the NARX-SOM flood prediction algorithm. The time for inundation map prediction for each area was within two minutes, but the one- and two-dimensional flood simulation usually takes 60â80 minutes.

Remote sensing, specifically synthetic aperture radar (SAR), has been widely used to detect surface water inundation to provide retrospective and near-real time (NRT) information due to its high-spatial resolution, self-illumination, and low atmospheric attenuation. However, the efficacy of flood inundation mapping with SAR is susceptible to reflections and scattering from a variety of factors including dense vegetation and urban areas. In this study, the topographic dataset Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) was investigated as a potential supplement to Sentinel-1A C-Band SAR along with supervised machine learning to improve the detection of inundation in heterogeneous areas. Three machine learning classifiers were trained on two sets of features dual-polarized SAR only and dual-polarized SAR along with HAND to map inundated areas. Three study sites along the Neuse River in North Carolina, USA during the record flood of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 were selected. The binary classification analysis (inundated as positive vs. non-inundated as negative) revealed significant improvements when incorporating HAND in several metrics including classification accuracy (ACC) (+36.0%), critical success index (CSI) (+39.95%), true positive rate (TPR) (+42.02%), and negative predictive value (NPV) (+17.26%). A marginal change of +0.15% was seen for positive predictive value (PPV), but true negative rate (TNR) fell-14.4%. By incorporating HAND, a significant number of areas with high SAR backscatter but low HAND values were detected as inundated which increased true positives. This in turn also increased the false positives detected but to a lesser extent as evident in the metrics. This study demonstrates that HAND could be considered a valuable feature to enhance SAR flood inundation mapping especially in areas with heterogeneous land covers with dense vegetation that interfere with SAR.

This study proposed to recognize and map the Amazon coastal environments through the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar, provided by Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) systems. The SAR datasets consisted of interferometric and stereo pairs, restricted to single-revisit and obtained with small interval (1â11 days), under steeper (? < 35Â°) and shallow (? ? 35Â°) incidence angles, and during the rainy and dry seasons. From the 4 acquisitions of X-band SAR data, attributes such as the backscattering coefficient, coefficient of variation, texture, coherence, and Digital Surface Model (DSM) were derived, adding each variable in 5 scenarios. These combinations resulted in 20 models, which were submitted individually to the machine learning (ML) classification approach by Random Forest (RF). The backscattering and altimetry described the coastal environments which shared ambiguity and high dispersion, with the lowest separability for vegetated environments such as Mangrove, Vegetated Coastal Plateau and Vegetated Fluvial Marine Terrace. The coherence provided by interferometry was weak (<0.44), even during the dry season, in the other hand, the cross-correlation was strong (>0.60), during the rainy and dry season showing more suitability for radargrammetry on the Amazon coast. The RF models resulted in Kappa coefficient between 0.39 to 0.70, indicating that the use of X-band SAR images at an incidence angle greater than 44Â° and obtained in the dry season is more appropriated for the morphological mapping. The RF models given by TSX achieved the higher mapping accuracies per scenario of SAR products, in order of 0.48 to 0.63. Despite this, the best classification was carried out by 19 RF model with 0.70, provided by CSK in shallow incidence composed by intensity, texture, coherence and stereo DSM. The CSK and TSX data allowed to map the Amazon coast precisely, based on X-band at single polarization, high spatial resolution and revisit, which has demonstrated the support for detailed cartography scale (1:50,000) and frequent updating (monthly up to yearly).

Inequalities in the coverage, quality, and currency of mapping persist, with significant gaps in remote and rural parts of the Global South. These regions, representing some of the most economically and resource-disadvantaged societies in the world, need high-quality mapping to aid in the delivery of essential services, such as health care, in response to severe challenges such as poverty, conflict, and global climate change. Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has shown potential as a solution to mapping inequalities. Contributions have largely been made in urban areas or in response to acute emergencies (e.g., earthquakes or floods), however, leaving rural regions that suffer from chronic humanitarian crises undermapped. An alternative solution is needed that harnesses the power of volunteer mapping more effectively to address regions in most need. Machine learning holds promise. In this article we propose centaur VGI, a hybrid system that combines the spatial cognitive abilities of human volunteers with the speed and efficiency of a machine. We argue that centaur VGI can contribute to mitigating some of the political and technological factors that produce inequalities in VGI mapping coverage and do so in the context of a case study in Acholi, northern Uganda, an inadequately mapped region in which the authors have been working since 2017 to provide outreach health care services to victims of major limb loss during conflict.

The study aims to develop and deploy an effective real-time pluvial flood forecasting AI platform.

It establishes a large number synthetic of torrential rainfall events and their simulated flooding datasets. The obtained data contain 6000 sets of color-classified rainfall hyetograph maps and 300,000 simulated flooding maps (water depth) in an urban district. The generated datasets are utilized for AI image processing. Through the AI deep learning classifications, the rainfall hyetograph map feature parameters are detected and extracted. The trained features are applied to predict potential rainfall events, recognize their potential inundated water depths as well as display flooding maps in real-time. The performance assessments of the platform are evaluated by Root Means Square Error (RMSE), Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSCE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results of RMSE and NSCE indicators illustrate that the methodologies and approaches of the AI platform are reliable and acceptable. However, the values of MAPE show inconsistency.

Traditional remote sensing platforms, such as Landsat and MODIS, are ill-suited for distinguishing native and non-native vegetation species in arid regions due to their large pixels compared to plant sizes. Unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, offer the potential to capture the high spatial resolution imagery needed to differentiate species. However, in order to extract the most benefits from these platforms, there is a need to develop more efficient and effective workflows. This paper presents an integrated spectral-structural workflow for classifying invasive vegetation species in the Lower Salt River region of Arizona, which has been the site of fires and flooding, leading to a proliferation of invasive vegetation species. Visible (RGB) and multispectral images were captured and processed following a typical structure from motion workflow, and the derived datasets were used as inputs in two machine learning classifications-one incorporating only spectral information and one utilizing both spectral data and structural layers (e.g., digital terrain model (DTM) and canopy height model (CHM)). Results show that including structural layers in the classification improved overall accuracy from 80% to 93% compared to the spectral-only model. The most important features for classification were the CHM and DTM, with the blue band and two spectral indices (normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference salinity index (NDSI)) contributing important spectral information to both models.",DRONES,10.3390/drones5010019,4,2,No,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, they are extremely nonlinear phenomena that are complex to analyze. Therefore, a classification-based real-time flood prediction model for urban areas is constructed in this study, by combining a numerical analysis model based on hydraulic theory with a machine learning model. Flood databases are constructed in advance for different rainfall scenarios using the Environmental Protection Agency-Storm Water Management Model (EPA-SWMM) and a two-dimensional inundation model. The flood depth data for each map grid are divided into five categories based on the average flood depth using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classification techniques for higher-precision flood range prediction. A model is constructed to predict the representative cumulative volume if the observed rainfall is entered. For spatial expansion of the flood depth with the predicted representative cumulative volume, a system capable of generating a real-time flood map is constructed by linking the cumulative volume of each grid with the representative cumulative volume using linear and nonlinear regression. When compared with the results of a verified two-dimensional (2D) flood model, the developed-model goodness-of-fit is 85%, with a required run time of 1 min 12 s.

This paper has proposed the ideas and methods for the detection of flood disaster based on IoT, BD, and convolutional deep neural network (CDNN) to overcome such difficulties. First, the input data is taken from the flood BD. Next, the repeated data are reduced by using HDFS map-reduce ().

Then, centred on the pre-processed data, the rule is generated by using a combination of attributes method.

Cities like Pune, Chennai experience heavy rainfall every year, followed by devastating floods. To better support the flood emergency plan operations, it is essential to have real-time flood maps depicting flood levels across the city. It can be made possible by mining information from flood-related social media posts shared by the public during floods. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method to assess the flood severity by using text and image data extracted from the social media posts. In the first stage of the methodology, the text data from the social media posts are analyzed, and flood-related posts are then passed to the second stage. In the second stage, the images associated with the social media posts are analyzed, and the severity of the flood in the particular location is updated in real-time. The text and image classification models are trained using the social media feeds posted during Pune, Chennai, and Kerala floods. The accuracy obtained using the proposed methodology is 98% and 78% for text and image classification, respectively. By introducing text classification in the flood severity estimation task, social media posts that are irrelevant to the flood severity estimation task are ignored without processing the multimedia data associated with it. This, in turn, results in reduced usage of valuable computational resources as classification of multimedia data is expensive compared to the classification of microblog text data.",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,10.1007/s00477-021-02161-3,4,2,No,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessing the hazard they pose and what drives their movement in the years following the mainshock has not yet been attempted, primarily because multitemporal landslide inventories are lacking. By exploiting a multitemporal inventory (2005-2018) covering the epicentral region of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and a set of conditioning factors (seismic, topographic, and hydrological), we perform statistical tests to understand the temporal evolution of these factors affecting debris remobilizations. Our analyses, supported by a random-forest susceptibility assessment model, reveal a prediction capability of seismic-related variables declining with time, as opposed to hydro-topographic parameters gaining importance and becoming predominant within a decade. These results may have important implications on the way conventional susceptibility/hazard assessment models should be employed in areas where coseismic landslides are the main sediment production mechanism on slopes. Plain Language Summary Strong earthquakes in mountain regions can trigger thousands of landslides, forming deposits of rock and soil debris along steep slopes. Months to years later, rainstorms may generate debris flows-destructive water-debris mixtures that rush downslope and flood valleys. Scientists use models to estimate the hazard of landslides and debris flows, which are based on accurate maps of the slopes, the type of rock or soil, inventories of known landslides, rainfall trends, and more. Susceptibility and hazard maps are the main product of these models. They are used to predict the probability of a hazardous event occurring at a given location in a given time span. These maps are usually ""static,"" in the sense that they are thought to remain valid for a long time because the data they are based upon (such as the shape of slopes) do not vary much. However, postearthquake landscapes are very dynamic: debris moves downslope, carried by rain or shaken by aftershocks; meanwhile, new landslides occur on some slopes, while others revegetate and stabilize. The overall picture is complex as many variables are involved. We use machine learning to demonstrate that static hazard maps become unable to predict landslides after just a few years, and advocate for the use of frequently updated maps linked to fresh inputs, tracking the location and activity of debris deposits, and old and new",GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,10.1029/2020GL090509,6,2,No,"Peoples R China,Czech Republic,Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flash floods are costly natural hazards, primarily due to their rapid onset. Therefore, predicting property damage of flash floods is imperative for proactive disaster management. Here, we present a systematic framework that considers a variety of features explaining different components of risk (i.e. hazard, vulnerability, and exposure), and examine multiple machine learning methods to predict flash flood damage. A large database of flash flood events consisting of more than 14 000 events are assessed for training and testing the methodology, while a multitude of data sources are utilized to acquire reliable information related to each event. A variable selection approach was employed to alleviate the complexity of the dataset and facilitate the model development process. The random forest (RF) method was then used to map the identified input covariates to a target variable (i.e. property damage). The RF model was implemented in two modes: first, as a binary classifier to estimate if a region of interest was damaged in any particular flood event, and then as a regression model to predict the amount of property damage associated with each event. The results indicate that the proposed approach is successful not only for classifying damaging events (with an accuracy of 81%), but also for predicting flash flood damage with a good agreement with the observed property damage. This study is among the few efforts for predicting flash flood damage across a large domain using mesoscale input variables, and the findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,10.1088/1748-9326/ab6edd,5,2,No,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mapping is performed for the largely irrigated dry season Boro rice (grown from November/December to May/June), and the largely rainfed Aman rice (grown from June/July to October/ November). The petabyte archive of Landsat reflectance data available via Google Earth Engine is used to extract monthly time-series of two remotely sensed vegetation indices - the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI) - which can capture crop phenological dynamics as they correlate during crop growth stages and can be used to discriminate standing water when EVI is low and GVMI is high. This feature is exploited to detect the effects of flooding before transplanting Boro rice in January and to capture the late phenological phases of Aman rice through harvesting months (October to November). A gap-filled and smoothed EVI and GVMI monthly time-series sequences for both rice cropping months are grouped using machine learning unsupervised K-means clustering into clusters (25 used here), and manually aggregated using crop calendars and local expert knowledge into rice types, other vegetated areas, water, non-permanent water and bare areas. A representative subset of these data are then used to construct a training sample using additional covariates besides the monthly EVI and GVMI values and train a Random Forest (RF) model capable of predicting the land cover types in other years. The resulting RF maps for the two cropping seasons were evaluated against publicly available survey crop statistics (from 1989 to 2016) and published Boro 30 m resolution maps for 2013 to 2016. The maps provide qualitative evidence that unsustainable groundwater extractions can be linked to Boro rice irrigation in some parts of northwest Bangladesh. Further research, using these maps and other hydrological data, is required to quantitatively assess when, where, and how much irrigation contributes to unsustainable groundwater use. The results show that the methodology can accurately (generally within 20% absolute error) capture Boro and Aman rice over the Green Revolution period, and other landscape dynamic characteristics of importance for environmental assessments, such as areas of standing water.",REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT,10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100460,6,2,No,"Bangladesh,Peoples R China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study adopts a simple and coherent approach based on the self-organizing map to systematically derive the monsoon annual cycle based on 850-hPa wind fields. The derived onset dates in the warm season agree well with the literature despite lacking documentation for winter-season stages. Linear regression suggests an inverse relationship between the length of the Spring (Meiyu) stage and that of the Pre-Meiyu (Mid-summer) stage, suggesting predictability of the Meiyu and Fall onsets. The Aleutian Low, the western North Pacific subtropical high, and the upper-level westerlies play important roles in the Spring, Pre-Meiyu, and Meiyu onsets. Observations reveal strong rain belt events form right after the monsoonal wind onsets in the warm season. The proposed approach to deriving monsoon stages and onsets would be useful for monsoon climate studies and operational monsoon diagnosis and forecasting. Plain Language Summary The East Asian monsoon profoundly affect the livelihoods of more than one-fifth of the global population. Given its impacts and complexity, many efforts have been taken to define the different monsoon stages' arrival with diverse and inconsistent criteria. Instead of adding more complicated criteria, we adopt a machine-learning-based approach to derive the annual cycle of the East Asian monsoon stages in a simple and systematic way. The derived arrival timings of the warm-season stages are consistent with the literature despite lacking documentation for winter-season stages. Linear regression shows that the arrival of the preceding monsoon stages could inform that of the ensuing stage during the warm season. We find distinct weather systems that possibly explain the onset of monsoon stages. Further analysis indicates that heavy and persistent rain belt events in the warm season tend to form right after monsoonal wind stages' onsets. The machine-learning-based approach to deriving the monsoon stages and onsets would be useful for monsoon climate research and practical use in operational monsoon diagnosis and forecasting, thereby short-term planning for agricultural activities and flood control.",GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,10.1029/2020GL089542,6,2,No,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multiplicity of climate hazards will be involved, triggering cumulative and interactive impacts on a variety of natural and human systems. An improved understanding of risk interactions and dynamics is required to support decision makers in their ability to better manage current and future climate change risks. To face this issue, the research community has been starting to test new methodological approaches and tools, including the application of Machine Learning (ML) leveraging the potential of the large availability and variety of spatio-temporal big data for environmental applications. Given the increasing attention on the application of ML methods to Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), this review mapped out the state of art and potential of these methods to this field of research. Scientometric and systematic analysis were jointly applied providing an in-depth review of publications across the 2000-2020 timeframe. The resulting output from the analysis showed that a huge variety of ML algorithms have been already applied within CCRA, among them, the most recurrent are Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. These algorithms are often applied in an ensemble or hybridized way to analyze most of all floods and landslides risk events. Moreover, the application of ML to deal with remote sensing data is consistent and effective across reviewed CCRA applications, allowing the identification and classification of targets and the detection of environmental and structural features. On the contrary concerning future climate change scenarios, literature seems not to be very widespread into scientific production, compared to studies evaluating risks under current conditions. The same lack can be noted also for the assessment of cascading and compound hazards and risks, since these concepts are recently emerging in CCRA literature but not yet in combination with ML-based applications.",EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103752,4,2,No,"Italy,Turkey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flood susceptibility modeling is an indirect method for reducing flood disaster losses. This study aimed to improve flood susceptibility modeling by developing a sequential ensemble (extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) model utilizing three swarm-based algorithms (bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), cuckoo search (CS), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms). Initially, an integration of optical (Landsat-8) and radar (Sentinel-1) satellite images were used to monitor the flooded areas during the July 2022 monsoon in the Kazerun region, Iran. A total of 1358 flood occurrence points were considered from the monitored flood areas; 70% (952 points) and 30% (406 points) were used for modeling and evaluating the models, respectively. Based on flood points and thirteen spatial criteria influencing floods, four flood models ((XGBoost, XGBoost-ABC, XGBoost-BFO, and XGBoost-CS)) were used to generate a flood susceptibility map (FSM). According to the results, the XGBoost-CS (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96), XGBoost-BFO (AUC = 0.953), XGBoost-ABC (AUC = 0.941), and XGBoost (AUC = 0.939) models have greater accuracy in flood susceptibility modeling, respectively. The results indicated that the models coupled with the three metaheuristic algorithms (XGBoost-ABC, XGBoost-BFO, and XGBoost-CS) exhibited higher flood susceptibility modeling accuracy than the standalone XGBoost model.

Logistic regression (LR), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), gradient boosting (GB), and a deep learning neural network (DLNN) model are the benchmark models used to compare their performance with that of a 1D-CNN model. Remote sensing (RS) techniques are used to collect the necessary flood related data, whereas thirteen flash-flood-related variables were used as predictive variables, such as elevation, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index, lithology, silt content, sand content, clay content, distance to faults, and distance to river network. The Weight of Evidence method was applied to calculate the correlation among the flood-related variables and to assign a weight value to each variable class. Regression analysis and multi-collinearity analysis were used to assess collinearity among the flood-related variables, whereas the Shapley Additive explanations method was used to rank the features by importance. The evaluation process involved estimating the predictive ability of all models via classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the success and predictive rate curves (AUC). The outcomes of the analysis confirmed that the 1D-CNN provided a higher accuracy (0.924), followed by LR (0.904) and DLNN (0.899). Overall, 1D-CNNs can be useful tools for analyzing flood susceptibility using remote sensing data, with high accuracy predictions.

In order to prevent and manage these disasters, it is crucial for decision-makers to create GIS-based flash flood susceptibility maps. In this study, we present an improved Blending approach, RF-Blending (Reserve Feature Blending), which differs from the Blending approach in that it preserves the original feature dataset during meta-learner training. Our objectives were to demonstrate the performance improvement of the RF-Blending approach and to produce flash flood susceptibility maps for all catchments in Jiangxi Province using the RF-Blending approach. The Blending approach employs a double-layer structure consisting of support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest (RF) as base learners for level-0, and the output of level-0 is utilized as the meta-feature dataset for the meta-learner in level-1, which is logistic regression (LR). RF-Blending employs the output of level-0 along with the original feature dataset for meta-learner training. To develop flood susceptibility maps, we utilized these approaches in conjunction with historical flash flood points and catchment-based factors. Our results indicate that the RF-Blending approach outperformed the other approaches. These can significantly aid catchment-based flash flood susceptibility mapping and assist managers in controlling and remediating induced damages. Â© 2023 IWA Publishing.

Inundated vegetation can account for over three-quarters of the total inundated area, yet widely used EO mapping approaches are limited to the detection of open water bodies. This paper presents a new wetland mapping approach, RadWet, that automatically defines open water and inundated vegetation training data using a novel mixture of radar, terrain, and optical imagery. Training data samples are then used to classify serial Sentinel-1 radar imagery using an ensemble machine learning classification routine, providing information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of inundation every 12 days at a resolution of 30 m. The approach was evaluated over the period 2017â2022, covering a range of conditions (dry season to wet season) for two sites: (1) the Barotseland Floodplain, Zambia (31,172 km2) and (2) the Upper Rupununi Wetlands in Guyana (11,745 km2). Good agreement was found at both sites using random stratified accuracy assessment data (n = 28,223) with a median overall accuracy of 89% in Barotseland and 80% in the Upper Rupununi, outperforming existing approaches. The results revealed fine-scale hydrological processes driving inundation patterns as well as temporal patterns in seasonal flood pulse timing and magnitude. Inundated vegetation dominated wet season wetland extent, accounting for a mean 80% of total inundation. RadWet offers a new way in which tropical wetlands can be routinely monitored and characterised. This can provide significant benefits for a range of application areas, including flood hazard management, wetland inventories, monitoring natural greenhouse gas emissions and disease vector control.

Nowadays, significant progress has been achieved in water detection using deep neural network (DNN) methods, but the blackbox behavior incurs many doubts in the performance of deep learning techniques, which undermines its trustworthiness in water detection from SAR imagery. By integrating SAR domain knowledge, DNN and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), an explainable DNN framework for surface water detection is proposed for the first time. This framework includes three parts: the water extraction network containing four backbone networks, the Local and Global Mixed Attribution (LGMA) module for performance evaluation of backbone network, and the Semantic Specific-class Activation Mapping (SSAM) module, which performs geo-visualization for the output layers of high-level features. In the experiment, SAR images from different resolutions and frequency-bands are utilized, which are from millimeter-wave and Sentinel-1 systems. The attribution maps and heatmaps of four backbone networks are assessed towards the final water extraction results. The experiment indicates that the proposed framework can glass-box the decision-making process of DNN in water detection and offer corresponding attribution analytics for given input SAR imagery. This work encourages other scholars to conduct extensive research on the explanation of DNN in SAR domain, gradually establish the trustworthiness of DNN, and promote the development of DNN in SAR images analytics.

The restoration and recovery are costly and can interrupt communitiesâ sustainable growth after the extensive flood. Flash floods (FF) are a frequent natural disaster that causes significant casualties and disrupts economic growth in the Brahmaputra River Basin (BRB). Hence, the flood susceptibility modeling of BRB is imperative. The study uses six machine learning (ML) techniques (three stand-alone such as artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), and random forest (RF), and three hybrid ensemble models (HEMs) including ANN-FL, FL-RF, and RF-ANN) to appraise flash flood Susceptibility (FFS) prediction in BRB considering 16 flash flood susceptibility factors. Area under the curve (AUC), ROC curve, confusion matrix (CM), and Friedman test are applied to assess the performance of the models. Results for the training and testing datasets showed that all HEMs models for FFS prediction in the BRB outperformed the stand-alone models. The RF-ANN has the best prediction ability of all models because the RF meta-classifier improves the ANN modelâs base-classifier precision. The RF-ANN model delineated 2908.46 km2 and 874.73 km2 areas as very high and high flood susceptible zones, whereas 995.99 km2, 702.48 km2, and 10,127.57 km2 areas were predicted as moderate, low, and very low flood susceptible zones. Slope, water, vegetation, PrC, aspect, and rainfall all make the BRB sensitive to FF, as per the analysis of InGR and PCM. This workâs accuracy of the ML HEMs used for FFS mapping is promising. Furthermore, the findings of this study may be valuable for flood prevention and management to deal with the current uncertainties and more precisely identify numerous characteristics that impact FFS. This research is helpful for policymakers because it provides information that could be utilized to develop measures to lessen the adverse effects of FF.

The study focuses on the coastal flood susceptibility through a holistic approach by combining three machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), with GIS techniques. Nine flood conditioning factors (Aspect, Slope, Elevation, Mean Sea Level, Wind, Distance from coast, Distance from river, Distance from cyclone and Geology) were considered in this study. These variables are selected by reviewing site-specific available literature and experts opinions. Relevant data were collected from several sources, and these data were analyzed in various software. The study also incorporates an analysis utilizing the best-fitted model among the three algorithms from a humanistic perspective. After obtaining results from the models, the output went under accuracy assessment to justify whether the model yielded accurate results or not. A comparative analysis to understand the suitability of these three algorithms is presented in the study, along with the delineation of five categories of flood susceptible classes of the study area. The Random Forest model was the most accurate, with an accuracy of 86.7 percent, followed by XGBoost with an accuracy of 86.3 percent and KNN with an accuracy of 85.5 percent. The Random Forest (RF) model was selected for further analysis as it yielded better accuracy incorporating the Upazila and population data. Further analysis shows that the district of Barguna, Bhola, and Patuakhali had the highest number of very high flood susceptible Upazilas among the 19 coastal districts in the study area. Around 10.63% of the study area's population, which is 4,214,084 people approximately, live in the Very High Susceptibility Zone.

Forecasting streamflow to mitigate municipal and environmental damage is therefore crucial. Streamflow prediction has been extensively demonstrated in the literature to estimate the continuous values of streamflow level. Prediction of continuous values of streamflow is not necessary in several applications and at the same time it is very challenging task because of uncertainty. A streamflow category prediction is more advantageous for addressing the uncertainty in numerical point forecasting, considering that its predictions are linked to a propensity to belong to the pre-defined classes. Here, we formulate streamflow prediction as a time series classification with discrete ranges of values, each representing a class to classify streamflow into five or ten, respectively, using machine learning approaches in various rivers in Malaysia. The findings reveal that several models, specifically LSTM, outperform others in predicting the following n-time steps of streamflow because LSTM is able to learn the mapping between streamflow time series of 2 or 3Â days ahead more than support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting (GB). LSTM produces higher F1 score in various rivers (by 5% in Johor, 2% in Kelantan and Melaka and Selangor, 4% in Perlis) in 2Â days ahead scenario. Furthermore, the ensemble stacking of the SVM and GB achieves high performance in terms of F1 score and quadratic weighted kappa. Ensemble stacking gives 3% higher F1 score in Perak river compared to SVM and gradient boosting.

One of the critical factors to handle such hazardous events is monitoring the affected areas and changes in flood patterns. Flood management is a very complex issue, largely owing to the growing population and investments in flood-affected regions. Satellite images especially Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are very useful and effective because SAR images are acquired day and night in all types of weather conditions. This research analyzes a combination of machine learning algorithms implemented on Sentinel-1A (SAR) data using supervised classification techniques to monitor the flooded areas in the North Indian region. Random Forest (RF) and the K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classification is applied to classify the different land covers such as water bodies, land, vegetation, and bare soil land covers. The outcomes of the presented work depict that the SAR data provides efficient information that helps in monitoring the flooded extents and the analysis shows that Sentinel-1 images are quite effective to detect changes in flood patterns in urban, vegetation, and regular water areas of the selected regions. The distribution of flooded areas was 16.6% and 16.8% in the respective region which is consistent with the resultant images of the proposed approach using RF and KNN classifiers. The obtained results indicate that both classifiers used in the work generate higher classification accuracy. These classifiers define the potential of multi-polarimetric SAR data in the classification of flood-affected areas. For a thorough evaluation and comparison, the RF and KNN are utilized as benchmarked classifiers. The classification accuracies based on the investigated results from the three SAR images can be improved by incorporating spatial and polarimetric features. In the future, the deep-learning classification techniques using ensemble strategies are expected to achieve an increased accuracy level with an overall classification strategy of urban and vegetation mapping.

Therefore, in the present study focusing on flood susceptibility zonation mapping in the Trotus River basin, the following algorithms were applied: forest by penalizing attributeâweights of evidence (forest-PA-WOE), best first decision treeâWOE, alternating decision treeâWOE, and logistic regressionâWOE. The best performant, characterized by a maximum accuracy of 0.981, proved to be forest-PA-WOE, whereas in terms of flood exposure, an area of over 16.22% of the Trotus basin is exposed to high and very high floods susceptibility. The performances applied models in the present work are higher than the models applied in the previous studies in the same study area. Moreover, it should be noted that the accuracy of the models is similar with the accuracies of the decision tree models achieved in the studies focused on other areas across the world. Therefore, we can state that the models applied in the present research can be successfully used in by the researchers in other case studies. The findings of this research may substantially map the flood risk areas and further aid watershed managers in limiting and remediating flood damage in the data-scarce regions. Moreover, the results of this study can be a very useful for the hazard management and planning authorities.

In this study, total 10 geospatial environment layers and past flood inventory from field were used to run the machine learning model i.e., MaxEnt for risk modeling of flood. The past flood data were separated into 75% for model building and 25% for model validation. The land use land cover change showed the highest contribution (40.8%) to the flood while the lowest contribution was of slope only 0.2%. 9% of total population were in high risk of flood while 39% population were in very low risk. Figure no. 13 shows that 5% of total household were in high risk, 55% were in moderate risk and 20% were in very low risk of flood. Out of total study area about 2.66% of the total area is in very high-risk zone to flood. High risk zone is found to be 4.89%, where as 9.48%, 20.61% and 62.36% are moderate, low, and very low risk zone area.

However, the current research on snowmelt flood susceptibility lacks a valid large-scale modeling approach. In this study, a novel high-performance deep learning model called Swin Transformer was used to assess snowmelt susceptibility in the Kunlun Mountains region, where snowmelt floods occur frequently. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were also involved in the performance comparison. Eighteen potential conditioning factors were combined with a historical flood inventory to form the database. Apart from the susceptibility assessment, sensitivity analysis was also conducted to reflect the impact of the conditioning factors on the susceptibility of different types of snowmelt floods. The results showed that Swin Transformer achieved the highest score in the model performance test (AUC = 0.99) and successfully identified the relationship between conditioning factors and snowmelt flooding. Elevation and distance to rivers are the most important factors that affect snowmelt flooding in the study region, whereas rainfall and snow water equivalent are the dominant natural factors for mixed and warming types. In addition, the north-central parts of the study area have high susceptibility to snowmelt flooding. The methods and results can provide scientific support for snowmelt flood modeling and disaster management.

However, a methodology for simultaneously predicting the rainfall return period and an inundation map for observed rainfall has not been presented. Simultaneous prediction of the return period and inundation map would be a useful technique for responding to floods in real-time and could provide an expected inundation area by return period. In this study, return period estimation for observed rainfall was performed via PNN (probabilistic neural network). SVR (support vector regression) and a SOM (self-organizing map) were used to predict flood volume and inundation maps. The study area was the Gangnam area, which has experienced extensive urbanization. The database for training SVR and SOM was constructed by one-and two-dimensional flood analysis with consideration of 120 probable rainfall events. The probable rainfall events were composed with 2-100 year return periods and 1-3 hour durations. The SVR technique was used to predict flood volume according to the rainfall return period, and the SOM was used to cluster various expected flood patterns to be used for predicting inundation maps. The prediction results were compared with the simulation results of a two-dimensional flood analysis model. The highest fitness of the predicted flood maps in the study area was calculated at 85.94%. The proposed method was found to constitute a practical methodology that could be helpful in improving urban flood response capabilities.

They are driven by the space-time structure of catchment rainfall, which is determined by large-scale, or even global-scale, atmospheric processes. The identification of coherent, large-scale atmospheric circulation structures that determine the moisture transport and convergence associated with rainfall-induced flooding can help improve its predictability and phenomenology. In this paper, we extend a methodology, used for the analysis of extreme rainfall events, to high streamflow events (HSEs). The approach combines multiple machine learning methods to link HSEs to atmospheric circulation patterns. An application to the German streamflow network using reanalysis data for the period 1960 to 2012 is presented. Daily streamflow from 166 gauges, homogeneously distributed across Germany, are used. Geopotential height fields and integrated vapor transport (IVT) are derived from reanalysis data. An unsupervised neural network, Self Organizing Maps, is applied to geopotential height to identify a finite number of circulation patterns (CPs). Event synchronization between CPs and HSEs is used to establish if they are linked or not. If they are linked, the Event Synchronization method computes the delay between the occurrence of a CP and a HSE. Finally, local logistic regression is used to estimate the probability of occurrence of a HSE, as function of CP and IVT. We demonstrate that our approach is very effective to evaluate HSE probability occurrence across Germany. Â©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Existing pluvial flood analysis methods are unable to simulate real-time regional flooding processes under spatiotemporally varying rainstorms. This paper presents a deep learning-enabled super-resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method to simulate the real-time pluvial flooding process over a large area under spatiotemporally varying rainstorms. Compared with existing flood downscaling techniques, which are limited to flow depth, the proposed method produces high-resolution flow depth and velocity pre-dictions, providing more comprehensive information for flood emergency management. The proposed method adopts a coarse-grid hydrodynamic model to generate a low-resolution flood map time series, which is subse-quently converted to high-resolution flood maps by a deep learning model. The deep learning model can be trained using a limited number of assumed rainfall scenarios, which greatly reduces data preparation effort. The proposed method is applied to a complex terrain of 352 km2 in Hong Kong that covers both mountainous and urban areas. Results show that the proposed method simulates the spatiotemporal variations of flood depth and velocity with root mean square errors as low as 0.082 m and 0.088 m/s, respectively, and correlation coefficients of 0.962 and 0.921, respectively. The computation time for a 48-h rainfall event in the study area is less than 30 s, which is 2690 times faster than the direct fine-grid hydrodynamic analysis.

Initially, a digital elevation model (DEM) has been utilized to delineate a basin located in the city of New Cairo, Egypt, where the flash floods occur frequently. Subsequentially, 12 flood causative factors were calculated and mapped via ArcMap. Furthermore, the depth of runoff was calculated via HEC-RAS and employed as a flood causative factor. Additionally, both flooded points and flood causative factors have been employed by utilizing the ""GARP""* approach to produce the Flood Hazard Map (FHM). The state-of-art in this study is to predict the hazard degree of flash floods by utilizing the simulated runoff depth which has been used as flood causative factor in the selected machine learning technique.

In addition, the receiver operating characteristic ""ROC"" approach has been applied to examine the FHM, which estimated the area under curve as 96.88%.

To quantitatively assess the future trends of flood risks and to carry out effective adaptation measures are among the hot topics for flood risk management. A sound answer needs fine-scale data to support an integrative analysis of hydrology-hydrodynamic processes, socio-economic impacts, and adaptation measures. In this regard, this paper puts forward a set of multidisciplinary and comprehensive methods to address the frontier scientific issues. First, internet big data and machine learning methods were adopted to map the building footprint height, and its economic values, providing a fine-scale spatial and economic information of elements at risk. The residential building footprint was mapped with an accuracy of 92.8%, and the housing price was derived via web crawler from different online real estate websites. Second, the hydrology-hydrodynamic models of TOMAWAC, TELEMAC and MIKE 1D/2D were integrated to simulate four storm-surge flooding scenarios. The scenarios are based on the real Typhoon event TC9711 on August 18, 1997, whereby the wind wave. tide. 1D flood, and 2D flood processes are simulated and flood scenarios of four different return periods are extrapolated. Especially, for future scenarios in 2050, sea level rise and land subsidence are also considered. Third, the expected annual damage (EAD) is estimated via risk analysis technique with combination of flood maps in the four return periods and the fine-scale exposure data. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis was done to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two flood adaptation measures, i.e., dry flood-proofing and wet flood-proofing measures, for residential buildings. Taking Shanghai as an example, the above methods were applied to comprehensively assess the storm-caused flood risk of residential buildings, its future trends to 2050, and the costs and benefits of two adaptation measures. The results show that: (1) Sea-level rise and land subsidence will significantly exacerbate the flood risks in Shanghai. (2) Under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP8.5 High-end), the area of exposed residential buildings in Shanghai by 2050 may reach 31-49 km(2) (4%-6% of total building area) for a 1/200-year storm flood event and 180-206 km(2) (14%-16%) for a 1/5000-year event. (3) The EAD of residential buildings in 2017 is 440 million CNY (65.4 million USD), which can increase 1.6-2.0 times and reach to CNY 700 million-900 million (104.0 million-133.8 million USD) in 2050. (4) The implementation of both dry and wet flood-proofing measures could potentially reduce the EAD by 76%-79% and 88%-90%, respectively. Both measures are considerably cost-effective: the net present values of dry and wet flood-proofing measures are 2.84 billion-5.53 billion CNY (0.4 billion-0.8 billion USD) and 5.85 billion-9.94 billion CNY (0.9 billion-1.5 billion USD), and the benefit/cost ratios arc 1.9-2.4 and 7.9-9.8 respectively. This indicates that the cost-effectiveness of dry flood-proofing measures is less than that of wet measure. Our findings can provide both scientific understanding and effective adaptation measures for mitigating the future flood risk in Shanghai.

In particular, the impacts on shallow groundwater levels, which can lead to both flooding and drought, have major implications for agriculture, adaptation, and urban planning. Predicting such hydrological impacts is typically performed using physically based hydrological models (HMs). However, such models are computationally expensive, especially at high spatial resolutions. This study is based on the Danish national groundwater model, set up as adistributed, integrated surface-subsurface model at a 500 m horizontalresolution. Recently, a version at a higher resolution of 100 m was created, amongst others, to better represent the uppermost groundwater table and to meet end-user demands for water management and climate adaptation. However, the increase in resolution of the hydrological model also increases computational bottleneck. To evaluate climate change impacts, a large ensemble of climate models was run with the 500 m hydrological model, while performing the same ensemble run with the 100 m resolution nationwide model was deemed infeasible. The desired outputs at the 100 m resolution were produced by developing a novel, hybrid downscaling method based on machine learning (ML). Hydrological models for five subcatchments, covering around 9 % of Denmark and selected to represent a range of hydrogeological settings, were run at 100 m resolutions with forcings from a reduced ensemble of climate models. Random forest (RF) algorithms were established using the simulated climate change impacts (future - present) on water table depth at 100 m resolution from those submodels as training data. The trained downscaling algorithms were then applied to create nationwidemaps of climate-change-induced impacts on the shallow groundwater table at 100 m resolutions. These downscaled maps were successfully validated against results from a validation submodel at a 100 m resolution excluded from training the algorithms, and compared to the impact signals from the 500 m HM across Denmark. The suggested downscaling algorithm also opens for the spatial downscalingof other model outputs. It has the potential for further applications where, for example, computational limitations inhibit running distributedHMs at fine resolutions.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,10.5194/hess-26-5859-2022,4,2,No,Denmark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing rainfall intensity significantly escalates soil erosion and soil erosion related hazards. Forecasting accurate rainfall helps early detection of soil erosion vulnerability and can minimise the damages by taking appropriate measures caused by severe storms, droughts and floods. This study aims to predict soil erosion probability using the deep learning approach: long short-term memory neural network model (LSTM) and revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model. Daily rainfall data were gathered from five agro-meteorological stations in the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka from 1990 to 2021 and fed into the LSTM model simulation. The LSTM model was forecasted with the time-series monthly rainfall data for a long lead time period, rainfall values for next 36 months in each station. Geo-informatics tools were used to create the rainfall erosivity map layer for the year 2024. The RUSLE model prediction indicates the average annual soil erosion over the Highlands will be 11.92 t/ha/yr. Soil erosion susceptibility map suggests around 30 % of the land area will be categorised as moderate to very-high soil erosion susceptible classes. The resulted map layer was validated using past soil erosion map layers developed for 2000, 2010 and 2019. The soil erosion susceptibility map indicates an accuracy of 0.93 with the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), showing a satisfactory prediction performance.

The main objectives of this present study are simulating and predicting wetland areas using the advanced artificial neural network-based cellular automata (ANN-CA) model and water depth using statistical (adaptive exponential smoothing) as well as advanced machine learning algorithms such as Bagging, Random Subspace, Random Forest, Support vector machine, etc. The result shows that RmNDWI and NDWI are the representative wetland delineating indices. NDWI map was used for water depth prediction. Regarding the prediction of wetland areas, a remarkable decline is likely to be identified in the upcoming two decades. The small wetland patches away from the master stream are expected to dry out during the predicted period, where the major wetland patches nearer to the master stream with greater water depth are rather sustainable, but their depth of water is predicted to be reduced in the next decades. All models show satisfactory performance for wetland depth mapping, but the random subspace model was identified as the best-suited water depth predicting method with an acceptable prediction accuracy (root mean square error <0.34 in all the years) and the machine learning models explored better result than adaptive exponential smoothing.

This study aims to build an urban flood warning system for reducing the impact of flood disasters. A great number of storm-induced rainfall data were collected in Taipei, Taiwan, and the corresponding 2-D inundation maps were simulated for illustrating urban rainfall-flood inundation processes. We proposed a novel urban flood forecast methodology framed by machine learning and statistical techniques to mine the spatialâtemporal features between rainfall patterns and inundation maps for making multi-step-ahead regional flood inundation forecasts. The proposed methodology (PCA-SOM-NARX) integrated the advantages of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), and Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NARX). PCA was used to extract principal components representing the different spatial distributions of urban inundation. SOM was used to cluster high dimensional inundation datasets to form a two-dimensional topological feature map. NARX was used to establish multi-step-ahead flood forecast models for the next hour at a 10-minute scale. The results show that the PCA-SOM-NARX approach not only produced more stable and accurate multi-step-ahead forecasts on flood inundation depth but was also more indicative of the spatial distribution of inundation caused by torrential rain events, compared to the SOM-NARX approach (the benchmark). The results demonstrate the proposed methodology can adequately grasp the inundation status associated with different rainfall distributions to reliably and accurately forecast regional flood inundation depths, which can help decision makers respond to flooding earlier and mitigate flood disasters.

Therefore, it is of great significance to build a collapse and landslide susceptibility evaluation model in Wenchuan County for local disaster prevention and mitigation. Taking Wenchuan County as the research object and according to the data of 1081 historical collapse and landslide disaster points, as well as the natural environment, this paper first selects six categories of environmental factors (13 environmental factors in total) including topography (slope, aspect, curva-ture, terrain relief, TWI), geological structure (lithology, soil type, distance to fault), meteorology and hydrology (rainfall, distance to river), seismic impact (PGA), ecological impact (NDVI), and impact of human activity (land use). It then builds three single models (LR, SVM, RF) and three CF-based hybrid models (CF-LR, CF-SVM, CF-RF), and makes a comparative analysis of the accuracy and reliability of the models, thereby obtaining the optimal model in the research area. Finally, this study discusses the contribution of environmental factors to the collapse and the landslide susceptibility prediction of the optimal model. The research results show that (1) the areas prone to extremely high collapse and landslide predicted by the six models (LR, CF-LR, SVM, CF-SVM, RF and CF-RF) have an area of 730.595 km2, 377.521 km2, 361.772 km2, 372.979 km2, 318.631 km2, and 306.51 km2, respectively, and the frequency ratio precision of collapses and landslides is 0.916, 0.938, 0.955, 0.956, 0.972, and 0.984, respectively; (2) the ranking of the comprehensive index based on the confusion matrix is CF-RF&gt;RF&gt;CF-SVM&gt;CF-LR&gt;SVM&gt;LR and the ranking of the AUC value is CF-RF&gt;RF&gt;CF-SVM&gt;CF-LR&gt;SVM&gt;LR. To a certain extent, the coupling models can improve precision more over the single models.

With all-day and all-weather observing ability, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can monitor the distribution of rice in tropical and subtropical areas. To solve the problem of misclassification of rice with no marked signal during the flooding period in subtropical hilly areas, this paper proposes a new feature combination and dual branch bi-directional long short-term memory (DB-BiLSTM) model to achieve high-precision rice mapping using Sentinel-1 time series data. Based on field investigation data, the backscatter time series curves of the rice area were analyzed, and a characteristic index (VV ? VH)/(VV + VH) (VV: vertical emission and vertical receipt of polarization, VH: vertical emission and horizontal receipt of polarization) for small areas of hilly land was proposed to effectively distinguish rice and non-rice crops with no marked flooding period. The DB-BiLSTM model was designed, ensuring the independent learning of multiple features and effectively combining the time series information of both (VV ? VH)/(VV + VH) and VH features. The city of Shanwei, Guangdong Province, China, was selected as the study area. Experimental results showed that the overall accuracy of the rice mapping results was 97.29%, and the kappa coefficient reached 0.9424.

A few studies have explored the application of these models to develop new, and fast, applications for fluvial and pluvial flood prediction, extent mapping, and flood susceptibility assessment. However, most studies have focused on model development for specific catchment areas, drainage networks or gauge stations. Hence, their results cannot be directly reused to other contexts unless extra data are available and the models are further trained. This study explores the generalizability potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as flood prediction models. The study proposes a CNN-based model that can be reused in different catchment areas with different topography once the model is trained. The study investigates two options, patch- and resizing-based options, to process catchment areas of different sizes and different shapes. The results showed that the CNN-based model predicts accurately on âunseenâ catchment areas with significantly less computational time when compared to physically-based models. The obtained results also suggest that the patch-based option is more effective than the resizing-based option in terms of prediction accuracy. In addition, all experiments have shown that the prediction of flow velocity is more accurate than water depth, suggesting that the water accumulation is more sensitive to global elevation information than flow velocity.

This method incorporated twelve explanatory factors, including daily precipitation, 3-day cumulated rainfall prior to flood occurrences, elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, topographic wetness index, stream power index, distance to river, leaf area index, impervious surface percentage, distance to road, to perform waterlogging susceptibility analysis. The rainstorm on July 6, 2016 in the main districts of Wuhan, China was used as the scenario to test its feasibility. Cohen's kappa index, accuracy, precision, and recall were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The accuracy of the proposed model (93.6% for training data and 90.1% for testing data) is higher than WELLSVM, support vector machine, and logistic regression, demonstrating the advantages of utilizing unlabeled data and optimized parameter selection. The proposed model can also well identify the waterlogging susceptibility zones. The highest waterlogging susceptibility areas are located in the area with high impervious surface percent, intersections, culverts and overpasses, lakeshore, and riverbank. Elevation and precipitation factors are the most influential factors to waterlogging susceptibility.

Based on forecast precipitation, topography, and pipe networks, flood simulations can provide early warnings for areas and buildings at risk of flooding. Basement windows, doors, and underground garage entrances are common places where floodwater can flow into a building. Some buildings have been prepared or designed considering the threat of flooding, but others have not. Therefore, knowing the heights of these facade openings helps to identify places that are more susceptible to water ingress. However, such data is not yet readily available in most cities. Traditional surveying of the desired targets may be used, but this is a very time-consuming and laborious process. Instead, mobile mapping using LiDAR (light detection and ranging) is an efficient tool to obtain a large amount of high-density 3D measurement data. To use this method, it is required to extract the desired facade openings from the data in a fully automatic manner. This research presents a new process for the extraction of windows and doors from LiDAR mobile mapping data. Deep learning object detection models are trained to identify these objects. Usually, this requires to provide large amounts of manual annotations. In this paper, we mitigate this problem by leveraging a rule-based method. In a first step, the rule-based method is used to generate pseudo-labels. A semi-supervised learning strategy is then applied with three different levels of supervision. The results show that using only automatically generated pseudo-labels, the learning-based model outperforms the rule-based approach by 14.6% in terms of F1-score. After five hours of human supervision, it is possible to improve the model by another 6.2%. By comparing the detected facade openings' heights with the predicted water levels from a flood simulation model, a map can be produced which assigns per-building flood risk levels. Thus, our research provides a new geographic information layer for fine-grained urban emergency response. This information can be combined with flood forecasting to provide a more targeted disaster prevention guide for the city's infrastructure and residential buildings. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to achieve such a large scale, fine-grained building flood risk mapping.

We harnessed publicly available geospatial datasets and random forest algorithms to analyze the spatial distribution and underlying drivers of flood damage probability (FDP) caused by excessive rainfall and overflowing water bodies across the conterminous United States. From this, we produced the first spatially complete map of FDP for the nation, along with spatially explicit standard errors for four selected cities. We trained models using the locations of historical reported flood damage events (n = 71 434) and a suite of geospatial predictors (e.g. flood severity, climate, socio-economic exposure, topographic variables, soil properties, and hydrologic characteristics). We developed independent models for each hydrologic unit code level 2 watershed and generated a FDP for each 100 m pixel. Our model classified damage or no damage with an average area under the curve accuracy of 0.75; however, model performance varied by environmental conditions, with certain land cover classes (e.g. forest) resulting in higher error rates than others (e.g. wetlands). Our results identified FDP hotspots across multiple spatial and regional scales, with high probabilities common in both inland and coastal regions. The highest flood damage probabilities tended to be in areas of low elevation, in close proximity to streams, with extreme precipitation, and with high urban road density.

On 17 December 2017, a catastrophic flood of 7 Ã 106 m3 almost destroyed Villa Santa LucÃ­a and approximately 3 km of the southern highway (Route 7), the only land route in Chilean Patagonia that connects this vast region from north to south, exposing the vulnerability of the population and critical infrastructure to these natural hazards. The 2017 flood produced a paradigm shift on the analysis scale to understand the danger to which communities and their infrastructure are exposed. Thus, in this study, we sought to evaluate the susceptibility of landslides in the Yelcho and Rio Frio basins, whose intersection represents the origin of this great flood. For this, we used two approaches, (1) geospatial data in combination with machine learning methods using different training configurations and (2) a qualitative analysis of the landscape considering the geological and geomorphological conditions through fieldwork. For statistical modeling, we used an inventory of landslides that occurred between 2008 and 2017 and a total of 17 predictive variables, which are geoenvironmental, climatological and environmental triggers derived from volcanic and seismic activity. Our results indicate that soil moisture significantly impacted spatial susceptibility, followed by lithology, drainage density and seismic activity. Additionally, we observed that the inclusion of climatic predictors and environmental triggers increased the average performance score of the models by up to 3-5%. Based on our results, we believe that the wide distribution of volcanic-sedimentary rocks hydrothermally altered with zeolites in the western mountains of the Yelcho and Rio Frio basin are highly susceptible to generating large-scale landslides. Therefore, the town of Villa Santa Lucia and the âCarretera Australâ (Route 7) are susceptible to new landslides coming mainly from the western slope.

Rapid, accurate, and large-scale flood mapping is ur-gently needed for flood management, and to date has been successfully implemented benefiting from the advancement in remote sensing and cloud computing technology. Yet, the effects of agricultural emergency response to floods have been limitedly evaluated by satellite-based remote sens-ing, resulting in biased post-flood loss assessments. Addressing this challenge, this study presents a method for monitoring post-flood agricultural recovery using Sentinel-1/2 imagery, tested in three flood-affected main grain production areas, in the middle and lower Yangtze and Huai River, China. Our results indicated that 33â72% of the affected croplands were replanted and avoided total crop failures in summer 2020. Elevation, flood duration, crop rotation scheme, and flooding emergency management affect the post-flood recovery performance. The findings also demonstrate rapid intervention measures adjusted to local conditions could reduce the agricultural failure cost from flood disasters to a great extent. This study provides a new alternative for comprehensive disaster loss assessment in flood-prone agricultural regions, which will be insightful for worldwide flood control and management.

It is acknowledged that climate change will persist and perhaps intensify in the future, and it is thus meaningful to explore the quantitative impacts of these changes on hydrological regimes. The Jiulong River basin serves as an important watershed on the southeast coast of China. However, future hydrological changes under the combined impacts of climate change and land use change have been barely investigated. In this study, the climate outputs from five general circulation models (GCMs) under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were corrected and spatially downscaled by a statistical downscaling method combining quantile mapping and machine learning. The future high-resolution land use maps were projected by the CAâMarkov model with land use changes from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) as constraints. The future dynamic vegetation process was projected by the Biome-GBC model, and then, the future hydrological process under four representative concentration pathways and shared socioeconomic pathways (RCPâSSP) combined scenarios was simulated by a distributed hydrological model. Based on the copula method, the flood frequency and corresponding return periods were derived. The results demonstrated that future precipitation and air temperature would continue to rise, and future land use changes would have different developing pathways determined by the designs in various SSPâRCPs. Under the combined impacts of climate and land use change, the total available water resources will increase due to increasing precipitation, and the high flow and low flow will both increase at three stations under the four SSPâRCPs. The annual 1-day maximum discharge is projected to increase by 67â133% in the last decade of the 21st century, and the annual 7-day minimum discharge is projected to increase by 19â39%. The flood frequency analysis showed that the Jiulong River basin would face more frequent floods in the future. By the end of the 21st century, the station-average frequency of a historical 100-year flood will increase by 122% under the most optimistic scenario (SSP126) and increase by 213% under the scenario of greatest regional rivalry (SSP370). We demonstrated that climate change would be the major cause for the increase in future high flows and that land use change would dominate future changes in low flows. Finally, we recommend integrated and sustainable water management systems to tackle future challenges in this coastal basin. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Flash-flood potential mapping can provide very useful information that can be used in order to adopt the most appropriate measures to reduce the risk of these phenomena. A precise model is needed in order to predict flash flood potential, which can help to improve flood management strategies, as it can be used to develop more effective flood management methods. In this present research, Index of Entropy (IOE), Logistic Regression (LR), four machine learning models (, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN)) and their 5 stacking ensembles were used to construct a new GIS-based framework for flash flood-potential mapping in the Suha River Basin, Romania. For the purposes of running the models, 8 topographical and environmental factors (slope, land use, plan curvature, profile curvature, convergence index, aspect, hydrological soil groups and tpi), along with 111 torrential locations were used to run the five applied models. In order to facilitate training and validation purposes, the entire dataset was divided into 70:30 parts. ROC Curve and statistical measures were employed in order to verify the model reliability and also validate the results. It is noteworthy here that in the training procedure, the stacking ensemble constructed through the combination of all machine learning and statistical learning models (LCkNS) was better than all the other models with a maximum accuracy of 0.972. The models used, revealed that between 10% and 22% of Suha river basin is occupied by high and very high flash-flood potential.

In this paper, flood susceptibility modelling was evaluated in the Ras Gharib region of Egypt using two effective techniques machine learning technique-MLT (Support Vector Machine (SVM)) and deep learning method-DL (Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)). Thirteen flood related factors and flood inventory layer were prepared to construct these models. Validation was performed with 30% of the flood locations where receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the deep learning technique (CNN) gave a prediction accuracy of 86.5% (high performance), while the MLTs (SVM) gave 71.6% (medium performance). The results show that CNN provides 17% better than SVM which indicates a powerful and accurate model in flood susceptibility mapping.

Extreme weather events, such as floods, rising sea levels, and storms, stand as characteristic examples that impair the core services of the global ecosystem. Especially floods have a severe impact on human activities, hence, early and accurate delineation of the disaster is of top priority since it provides environmental, economic, and societal benefits and eases relief efforts. In this article, we introduce OmbriaNet, a deep neural network architecture, based on convolutional neural networks, that detects changes between permanent and flooded water areas by exploiting the temporal differences among flood events extracted by different sensors. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach, we generated OMBRIA, a bitemporal and multimodal satellite imagery dataset for image segmentation through supervised binary classification. It consists of a total number of 3.376 images, synthetic aperture radar imagery from Sentinel-1, and multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2, accompanied with ground-truth binary images produced from data derived by experts and provided from the Emergency Management Service of the European Space Agency Copernicus Program. The dataset covers 23 flood events around the globe, from 2017 to 2021. We collected, co-registrated and preprocessed the data in Google Earth Engine. To validate the performance of our method, we performed different benchmarking experiments on the OMBRIA dataset and we compared with several competitive state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental analysis demonstrated that the proposed formulation is able to produce high-quality flood maps, achieving a superior performance over the state-of-the-art.

The current study applied four machine learning models (i.e. Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) ensembled with the Statistical Index (SI) to develop flash flood susceptibility mapping (FFSM). 110 flash flood locations in the Sungai Pinang catchment were used in this study. Genetic algorithm (GA) was combined with Fuzzy Unordered Rules Induction Algorithm (FURIA), Rotation Forest, and Random Subspace for the feature selection method (FSM). The results showed that GA-FURIA outperformed the other two models in terms of accuracy based on the FSM. Twelve flash flood variables were selected by GA-FURIA. The FFSM results showed that the SI-RF model has the highest area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve of success rate (0.978), whereas the SI-XGB has the best AUROC in terms of validation rate (0.997).

Timely monitoring of flood extent helps authorities identify severe impacts and plan relief operations. Remote sensing through satellite imagery is an effective method to identify flooded areas. However, critical contextual information about the severity of structural damage or urgent needs of affected population cannot be obtained from remote sensing alone. On the other hand, social sensing through microblogging sites can potentially provide useful information directly from eyewitnesses and affected people. Therefore, this paper explores the integration of remote sensing and social sensing data to derive informed flood extent maps. For this purpose, we employ state-of-the-art deep learning methods to process heterogeneous data obtained from four case-study areas, including two urban regions from Somalia and India and two coastal regions from Italy and The Bahamas. On the remote sensing side, we observe that deep learning models perform generally better than Otsu in flood water prediction. For example, for highly urban areas from Somalia and India, U-Net achieves better F1-scores (0.471 and 0.310, respectively) than Otsu (0.297 and 0.251, respectively). Similarly, for coastal areas, FCN yields a better F1-score for Italy (0.128) than Otsu (0.083) while FCN and Otsu perform on par for The Bahamas (0.102 and 0.105, respectively). Then, on the social sensing side, we add two data layers representing relevant tweet text and images posted from the case-study regions to highlight different ways these heterogeneous data sources complement each other. Our extensive analyses reveal several valuable insights. In particular, we identify three types of signals: (i) confirmatory signals from both sources, which puts greater confidence that a specific region is flooded, (ii) complementary signals that provide different contextual information including needs and requests, disaster impact or damage reports and situational information, and (iii) novel signals when both data sources do not overlap and provide unique information.

In this study, we apply a multivariate analysis method (PCA) and four machine learning algorithms to investigate and map the variability and vulnerability of urban floods in the city of Tangier, northern Morocco. Thirteen parameters that could potentially affect urban flooding were selected and divided into two categories: geo-environmental parameters and socio-economic parameters. PCA processing allowed identifying and classifying six principal components (PCs), totaling 73% of the initial information. The scores of the parameters on the PCs and the spatial distribution of the PCs allow to highlight the interconnection between the topographic properties and urban characteristics (population density and building density) as the main source of variability of flooding, followed by the relationship between the drainage (drainage density and distance to channels) and urban properties. All four machine learning algorithms show excellent performance in predicting urban flood vulnerability (ROC curve > 0.9). The Classifications and Regression Tree and Support Vector Machine models show the best prediction performance (ACC = 91.6%). Urban flood vulnerability maps highlight, on the one hand, low lands with a high drainage density and recent buildings, and on the other, higher, steep-sloping areas with old buildings and a high population density, as areas of high to very-high vulnerability.

This study used random forest classification to generate maps of inundation from L-band UAVSAR imagery processed using the FreemanâDurden decomposition method. An average overall classification accuracy of 87% is achieved with this methodology, with areas of both under-and overprediction for the focus classes of open water and inundated forest. Fuzzy logic operations using hydrologic variables are used to reduce the number of small noise-like features and false detections in areas unlikely to retain water.

To solve this problem, this study develops the Absence Point Generation (APG) toolbox which is a Python-based ArcGIS toolbox for automated construction of absence-datasets for geospatial studies. The APG employs a frequency ratio analysis of four commonly used and important driving factors such as altitude, slope degree, topographic wetness index, and distance from rivers, and considers the presence locations buffer and density layers to define the low potential or susceptibility zones where absence-datasets are generated. To test the APG toolbox, we applied two benchmark algorithms of random forest (RF) and boosted regression trees (BRT) in a case study to investigate groundwater potential using three absence datasets i.e., the APG, random, and selection of absence samples (SAS) toolbox. The BRT-APG and RF-APG had the area under receiver operating curve (AUC) values of 0.947 and 0.942, while BRT and RF had weaker performances with the SAS and Random datasets. This effect resulted in AUC improvements for BRT and RF by 7.2, and 9.7% from the Random dataset, and AUC improvements for BRT and RF by 6.1, and 5.4% from the SAS dataset, respectively.

As such, in this study, two well-known machine learning classifiers, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), are used for land cover mapping. In addition, two advanced deep learning algorithms, namely, the GAMLP and FSMLP, that are based on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) function are developed in MATLAB programming language. The GAMLP uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimise parameters of the MLP function and, on the other hand, the FSMLP uses a derivative-free function for optimisation of the MLP function parameters. Three different scenarios using Landsat-8 imagery with spatial resolutions of 30 and 15 m are defined to investigate the effects of data pre-processing on the final predicted LULC map. Results based on the statistical indices, including overall accuracy (OA) and kappa index, show that the developed MLP-based algorithms have relatively high accuracies with higher than 98% correct classification. Besides the statistical indices, final LULC maps are interpreted visually where the GAMLP and FSMLP give the best results for the pre-processed Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m, but they have the worst outcomes for the unprocessed Landsat-8 imagery compared to SVM and RF classifiers visually and statistically.

It is a crowdsourcing platform, capable of complementing and supplementing remote sensing data in disaster mapping. Continuous monitoring of disasters such as floods from pre-stage to post stage is essential and geo-social media can attain it. The present research proposes a robust architecture to develop a social media-based near-real time flood monitoring system. In addition, our research article also emphasizes the efficient methods to process, analyse and explore multiple data dimensions of social media. A prototype model was prepared and tested on the tweets of Chennai floods 2015 to demonstrate social media potential in disaster monitoring. We implemented Natural Language Processing and Supervised Machine Learning in data processing and analysis segments of the framework by assembling various open source python libraries to develop the prototype. Initially, we built the required tweet corpus and performed pre-processing steps on it. Later, the collected tweets were geocoded with the place names available in the tweets and classified them into various flood topic related classes using Naive Bayes classifier. Subsequently, the tweets showcasing the flood condition were determined to generate a point map and a point density map to identify the flood hotspots. We verified our results with openly available 2015 Chennai flood map that is generated using remote sensing images and found positive outcome. A prototype web portal was developed to publish the results from above model as web maps. Furthermore, the portal would prove to be useful as a source for disseminating information to the public. The results prove that the proposed framework is evidently supportive in establishing a near real time monitoring system during emergencies.

For example, in observation-based flood inundation mapping, there is a need to map the full flood extent on geographic terrains based on earth imagery that partially covers a region. Existing research mostly focuses on addressing incomplete or missing data through data cleaning and imputation or modeling missing values as hidden variables in the EM algorithm. These methods, however, assume that missing feature observations are rare and thus are ineffective in problems whereby the vast majority of feature observations are missing. To address this issue, we recently proposed a new approach that incorporates physics-aware structural constraint into the model representation. We design efficient learning and inference algorithms. This paper extends our recent approach by allowing feature values of samples in each class to follow a multi-modal distribution. Evaluations on real-world flood mapping applications show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy, and the multi-modal extension is more robust than our early single-modal version. Computational experiments show that the proposed solution is computationally efficient on large datasets.

While various statistical and climate models have been developed for the purpose of simulating extremes, a consistent definition of extreme events is still lacking. Furthermore, to better assess the performance of the climate models, a variety of spatial forecast verification measures have been developed. However, in most cases, the spatial verification measures that are widely used to compare mean states do not have sufficient theoretical justification to benchmark extreme events. In order to alleviate inconsistencies when defining extreme events within different scientific communities, we propose a new generalized Spatio-Temporal Threshold Clustering method for the identification of extreme event episodes, which uses machine learning techniques to couple existing pattern recognition indices with high or low threshold choices. The method consists of five main steps: (1) construction of essential field quantities; (2) dimension reduction; (3) spatial domain mapping; (4) time series clustering; and (5) threshold selection. We develop and apply this method using a gridded daily precipitation dataset derived from rain gauge stations over the contiguous United States. We observe changes in the distribution of conditional frequency of extreme precipitation from large-scale well-connected spatial patterns to smaller-scale more isolated rainfall clusters, possibly leading to more localized droughts and heat waves, especially during the summer months. The proposed method automates the threshold selection process through a clustering algorithm and can be directly applicable in conjunction with modeling and spatial forecast verification of extremes. Additionally, it allows for the identification of synoptic-scale spatial patterns that can be directly traced to the individual extreme episodes, and it offers users the flexibility to select an extreme threshold that is linked to the desired geometrical properties. The approach can be applied to broad scientific disciplines. Â© 2021 EDP Sciences.

The current practice to survey an area of rice production manually and in near real-time is expensive and involves a high workload for local statisticians. Remote sensing technology with satellite-based sensors has grown in popularity in recent decades as an alternative approach, reducing the cost and time required for spatial analysis over a wide area. However, cloud-free pixels of optical imagery are required to pro-duce accurate outputs for agriculture applications. Thus, in this study, we propose an integration of optical (PROBA-V) and radar (Sentinel-1) imagery for temporal mapping of rice growth stages, including bare land, vegetative, reproductive, and ripening stages. We have built classification models for both sensors and combined them into 12-day periodical rice growth-stage maps from January 2017 to September 2018 at the sub-district level over Java Island, the top rice production area in Indonesia. The accuracy measurement was based on the test dataset and the predicted cross-correlated with monthly local statistics. The overall accuracy of the rice growth-stage model of PROBA-V was 83.87%, and the Sentinel-1 model was 71.74% with the Support Vector Machine clas-sifier. The temporal maps were comparable with local statistics, with an average correlation between the vegetative area (remote sensing) and harvested area (local statistics) is 0.50, and lag time 89.5 days (n = 91). This result was similar to local statistics data, which correlate planting and the harvested area at 0.61, and the lag time as 90.4 days, respectively. Moreover, the cross-correlation between the predicted rice growth stage was also consistent with rice development in the area (r > 0.52, p < 0.01). This novel method is straightforward, easy to replicate and apply to other areas, and can be scaled up to the national and regional level to be used by stakeholders to support improved agricultural policies for sustainable rice production.

Both the effectiveness and efficiency of post-classification comparison heavily depend on the classifierâs precision and generalization abilities. In practice, practitioners used to train a novel image classifier for an unex-pected disaster from scratch in order to evaluate building damage. Recently, it has become feasible to train a deep learning model to recognize buildings from very high-resolution images from all over the world. In this paper, we first evaluate the generalization ability of a global model trained on aerial images using post-disaster satellite images. Then, we systemically analyse three kinds of method to promote its generalization ability for post-disaster satellite images, i.e., fine-tune the model using very few training samples randomly selected from each disaster, transfer the style of postdisaster satellite images using the CycleGAN, and perform feature transformation using domain adversarial training. The xBD satellite images used in our experiment consist of 14 different events from six kinds of frequently occurring disaster types around the world, i.e., hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and wildfires. The experimental results show that the three methods can significantly promote the accuracy of the global model in terms of building mapping, and it is promising to conduct post-classification comparison using an existing global model coupled with an advanced transfer-learning method to quickly extract the damage information of buildings.

The results revealed that the Random Forest model achieved the highest F1-score (approx. 0.99), among others utilised for generating flood hazard maps.

This study proposes to compare and evaluate the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Shannon's Entropy (SE), and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods in the preparation of flood susceptibility mapping and assess their contextual suitability. The study has been carried out in coastal districts of West Bengal, India namely, South 24 Parganas and East Midnapur. Nine flood conditioning factors were identified and used as input parameters for the study. Each flood susceptibility map was subdivided into four categories where 27.29% of the study area were categorized as highly susceptible, while 39.45% of area were categorized as moderately susceptible to flood hazards. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Seed Cell Area Index (SCAI) were applied for accuracy assessment and validation of the selected models. AUC values for ROC curves showed that the performance of the SVM model is better than that of the AHP and SE methods. Moreover, Hot Spots analyses for identification of high flood susceptible clusters revealed that the SVM model was far superior when compared to the other two models. The factors selected for assessment of flood susceptibility in AHP and SE models could not respond to the changing scale of analyses and hence produced significant erroneous outcomes. Hence, the SVM model evolved as the most versatile method in this comparison.

This study designed a multi-hazard map for three important hazards (earthquakes, floods, and landslides) to identify endangered areas in Kermanshah province located in western Iran using ensemble SWARA-ANFIS-PSO and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO models. In the first step, flood and landslide inventory maps were generated to identify at-risk areas. Then, the occurrence places for each hazard were divided into two groups for training susceptibility models (70%) and testing the models applied (30%). Factors affecting these hazards, including altitude, slope aspect, slope degree, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to the faults, rainfall, lithology, and land use, were used to generate susceptibility maps. The SWARA method was used to weigh the subclasses of the influencing factors in floods and landslides. In addition, a peak ground acceleration (PGA) map was generated to investigate earthquakes in the study area. In the next step, the ANFIS machine learning algorithm was used in combination with PSO and GWO meta-heuristic algorithms to train the data, and SWARA-ANFIS-PSO and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO susceptibility maps were separately generated for flood and landslide hazards. The predictive ability of the implemented models was validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean square error (MSE) methods. The results showed that the SWARA-ANFIS-PSO ensemble model had the best performance in generating flood susceptibility maps with ROC = 0.936, RMS = 0.346, and MSE = 0.120.

For this work, sixteen flood controlling factors were applied. These predisposing factors were chosen based on field knowledge, previous researchs, and data availability. The FSMs were produced for the better palling and management of natural resources of Kunur River Basin, applying one deep learning model (DLM) includes convolution neural network (CNN) model and three benchmark machine learning methods (BMLMs) including multilayer perceptron (MLP), Bagging, and random forest (RF). The differences in prediction capacity between the models were assessed by applying the Friedman rank test and Wilcoxon test. Performance of the FSMs, evaluated through the precision, accuracy, AUC (area under the curve), and statistical measures revealed that CNN has the highest AUC values (0.934) followed by MLP (0.927), Bagging (0.897), and RF (0.900) respectively. The CNN modelâs prediction capacity is slightly better than Bagging, RF, and MLP models.

Next, the proposed CNN method is assessed in comparison to conventional logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor methods using several objective criteria, i.e., coefficient of determination, overall accuracy, mean absolute error and the root mean square error. Experimental results show that the CNN method outperforms the conventional machine learning algorithms in predicting probability of flash floods, debris flows and landslides. Finally, the susceptibility maps of the three hazards based on CNN are combined to create a multi-hazard susceptibility map. It can be observed from the map that 62.43% of the study area are prone to hazards, while 37.57% of the study area are harmless. In hazard-prone areas, 16.14%, 4.94% and 30.66% of the study area are susceptible to flash floods, debris flows and landslides, respectively. In terms of concurrent hazards, 0.28%, 7.11% and 3.13% of the study area are susceptible to the joint occurrence of flash floods and debris flow, debris flow and landslides, and flash floods and landslides, respectively, whereas, 0.18% of the study area is subject to all the three hazards. The results of this study can benefit engineers, disaster managers and local government officials involved in sustainable land management and disaster risk mitigation.

Recently, machine learning methods have become widespread in flood susceptibility assessments due to their efficiency and robustness. However, flood inventory data acquired from historical flooding records and field surveys in existing studies are sparse and not enough to develop accurate machine learning models. Thus, we developed a hybrid approach that integrates hydrodynamic model (HEC-HMS/RAS), rapid flood model (height above the nearest drainage, HAND) and machine learning model (random forest, RF) for flood susceptibility assessment. The proposed approach was then implemented in the Xinluo watershed, a flood-prone mountainous catchment in China. The results showed that the spatially continuous flood inventory map generated from HEC-HMS/RAS model satisfies the big data requirements of the RF model, and the proposed hybrid approach demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency in flood susceptibility assessment with overall accuracy and area under the ROC curve values of 0.915 and 0.912, respectively. The geographical and hydromorphological factors had greater effects on riverine flooding with average contribution of 27.8% and 27.6%. In comparison, the average contribution of land cover and meteorological factors were 24.3% and 20.3%, respectively. The method proposed in this study is effective in assessing and forecasting flood susceptibility and can facilitate resilience planning as well as integrated flood management.

Precisely, the Koshi River basin (KRB) is often impacted by floods over time. However, studies on estimating and predicting floods are still scarce in this basin. This study aims at developing a flood probability map using machine learning algorithms (MLAs): Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM) with multiple kernel functions including Pearson VII function kernel (PUK), polynomial, normalized poly kernel, and radial basis kernel function (RBF). Historical flood locations from available (topography, hydrogeology, and environmental) datasets were further considered to build a flood probability model. Two datasets were carefully chosen to measure the feasibility and robustness of MLAs: the training dataset (flood locations between 2010 and 2019) and the testing dataset (flood locations of 2020) with thirteen flood influencing factors. Validation of the MLAs was performed with statistical indices such as the coefficient of determination (r2: 0.546 â.995), mean absolute error (MAE: 0.009 â373), root mean square error (RMSE: 0.051â0.466), relative absolute error (RAE: 1.81â8.55%), and root-relative square error (RRSE: 10.19â91.00%). Results showed that the SVM-Pearson VII kernel (PUK) yielded better prediction than other algorithms. The resultant map from SVM-PUK revealed that 27.99% area with low, 39.91% area with medium, 31.00% with high, and 1.10% area with very high probabilities of flooding in the study area.

In recent years, high-resolution optical imagery becomes increasingly available with the deployment of numerous small satellites and drones. However, analysing such imagery data to extract flood extent poses unique challenges due to the rich noise and shadows, obstacles (e.g. tree canopies, clouds), and spectral confusion between pixel classes (flood, dry) due to spatial heterogeneity. Existing machine-learning techniques often focus on spectral and spatial features from raster images without fully incorporating the geographic terrain within classification models. In contrast, we recently proposed a novel machine-learning model called geographical hidden Markov tree (HMT) that integrates spectral features of pixels and topographic constraint from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data (i.e. water flow directions) in a holistic manner. This paper evaluates the model through case studies on high-resolution aerial imagery from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Geodetic Survey (NGS) together with DEM. Three scenes are selected in heavily vegetated floodplains near the cities of Grimesland and Kinston in North Carolina during Hurricane Matthew floods in 2016. Results show that the proposed HMT model outperforms several state of the art machine-learning algorithms (e.g. random forests, gradient-boosted model) by an improvement of F-score (the harmonic mean of the userâs accuracy and producerâs accuracy) from around 70% to 80% to over 95% on our datasets.

In addition, 420 actual flooded areas were recorded from the study area to create a flood inventory map. The inventory data were randomly divided into training group with 70% and validation group with 30%. The flood-related factors were tested with a multicollinearity test, the variance inflation factor (VIF) was less than 2.135, the tolerance (TOL) was more than 0.468, and their importance was evaluated with a partial least squares (PLS) method.

The class imbalance issue and the magnitude of the imbalance was explored in this study to highlight the uncertain nature of the flooding phenomenon. Therefore, the Random Forest (RF) was initially adopted to evaluate five imbalance class distribution scenarios (i.e., 1x, 10x, 25x, 50x, 100x non-flood events, for each x flood event). Parameter configurations of developed models were determined with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic, the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. The CS-RF model showed the highest (0.8455) prediction capability with regards to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) once the extent of imbalance was set as 50x. The CS-RF model was then benchmarked with another bagging, i.e., Extra Trees, and two boosting, i.e., Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, all integrated with the CS technique. Analysis results showed that the CS-RF is the most promising tree-based machine learning technique in flash flood susceptibility projection for the selected study area. According to the predictions, a flash flood susceptibility map was generated, where 9.35% of the basin was under very high flash flood risk. A recently developed model-agnostic game-theoretical method, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), was used for anatomizing the flash flood conditioning factors to highlight the contribution of each feature on the incident outcome prediction ensuring the transparency of the model findings. Overall, this study contributes to both theory and practice with particular focus on the model interpretability and existence of imbalance in the occurrence of flash flood events, assisting decision-makers in enhancing strategies to combat hazardous impacts of floods.

Several approaches for identifying flood-prone locations have been developed to reduce the overall harmful impacts on humans and the environment. However, due to the increased frequency of flooding and related disasters, coupled with the continuous changes in natural and social-economic conditions, it has become vital to predict areas with the highest probability of flooding to ensure effective measures to mitigate impending disasters. This study predicted the flood susceptible areas in Nigeria based on historical flood records from 1985~2020 and various conditioning factors. To evaluate the link between flood incidence and the fifteen (15) explanatory variables, which include climatic, topographic, land use and proximity information, the artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR) models were trained and tested to develop a flood susceptibility map. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate both model accuracies. The results show that both techniques can model and predict flood-prone areas. However, the ANN model produced a higher performance and prediction rate than the LR model, 76.4% and 62.5%, respectively. In addition, both models highlighted that those areas with the highest susceptibility to flood are the low-lying regions in the southern extremities and around water areas. From the study, we can establish that machine learning techniques can effectively map and predict flood-prone areas and serve as a tool for developing flood mitigation policies and plans.

Due to its geographical setup, mitigation and management of floods are challenging and hard to execute. One of the tools used in managing the events is âflood susceptibility mapping,â in which an incident probability as well as a rescue path is estimated and planned. To create one, the traditional GIS method called FRAM (flood risk assessment model), combined with AHP (analytical hierarchy process), is used and implemented on ArcGIS software. In this method, we first created a comparison table to compute weights for each of the selected factors. Then the computed weights were used in the FRAM model in ArcGIS to create a flood susceptibility map for each region. Each region was then classified as very high, high, medium, low, and very low risk. On the other hand, in computer science, machine learning and AI are prevalent and being adopted to various domains, promising the effectiveness of the method, potentially beat the forementioned traditional method. Therefore, ANN (artificial neural network) is adopted in this work to create the flood susceptibility map. The ANN technique is developed by using causal factors. The ANN classifies areas as either flood areas or flood-free areas. The 2 methods from different disciplines (GIS and Computer Science) are applied and described in this paper with the intention to prove whether the machine learning is really efficient and can outperform the traditional GIS approach. Data on Thailandâ s Ayutthaya Province is used in this work as a case study-in order to assess flood prone areas and compared for performance evaluation. Both of which use the 6 selected factors according to the literature: (i) flow accumulation, (ii) elevation, (iii) land use, (iv) rainfall intensity, (v) slope and (vi) soil types. The results from the 2 methods were verified with historical flood data and compared. The results showed that ANN (obtained via sensitivity analysis) outperformed the FRAM with precision of 79.90 %, recall of 79.04 %, F1-score of 79.08 % and accuracy of 79.31 %. In addition, we found that (according to our ANN experiments) the main causal factors related to flood susceptibility map only included 3 factors: flow accumulation, elevation, and soil types. Therefore, the proposed methodology for assessment of flood susceptibility areas using these 3 factors could be considered sufficient and applied to other regions in related applications, when needed.

The flood susceptibility maps that have been produced will be significant in determining future development strategies, especially in selecting the locations of new urban areas; and the findings of this study may be applied not only to this particular watershed in Vietnam, but also in developing countries around the world.

Flood risk mapping is a key tool in flood management. However, it is computationally expensive to produce flood risk maps using hydrodynamic models. To this end, this paper investigates the use of machine learning for the assessment of surface water flood risks in urban areas. The factors that are considered in machine learning models include coordinates, elevation, slope gradient, imperviousness, land use, land cover, soil type, substrate, distance to river, distance to road, and normalized difference vegetation index. The machine learning models are tested using the case study of Exeter, UK. The performance of machine learning algorithms, including naÃ¯ve Bayes, perceptron, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is compared based on a spectrum of indicators, e.g., accuracy, F-beta score, and receiver operating characteristic curve. The results obtained from the case study show that the flood risk maps can be accurately generated by the machine learning models. The performance of models on the 30-year flood event is better than 100-year and 1000-year flood events. The CNNs and ANNs outperform the other machine learning algorithms tested. This study shows that machine learning can help provide rapid flood mapping, and contribute to urban flood risk assessment and management. Â© 2021 by the authors.

An EAP is a disaster action plan that can designate evacuation paths for vulnerable districts. Generally, calculation of dam-break discharge in accordance with dam inflow conditions, calculation of maximum water surface elevation as per hydraulic channel routing, and flood map generation using topographical data are prepared for the purposes of creating an EAP. However, rainfall and flood patterns exhibited in the context of climate change can be extremely diverse. In order to prepare an efficient flood response, techniques should be considered that are capable of generating flood maps promptly while taking dam inflow conditions into account. Therefore, this study aims to propose methodology that is capable of generating flood maps rapidly for any dam inflow conditions. The proposed methodology was performed by linking a dynamic numerical analysis model (DAMBRK) with a random forest regression technique. The previous standard method of drawing flood maps often requires a significant amount of time depending on accuracy and personnel availability; however, the technique proposed here is capable of generating a flood map within one minute. Through use of this methodology, the time taken to prepare flood maps in large-scale water-disaster situations can be reduced. Moreover, methodology for estimating flood risk via use of flood mapping has been proposed. This study would provide assistance in establishing disaster countermeasures that take various flood scenarios into account by promptly providing flood inundation information to disaster-related agencies.

However, a methodology for simultaneously predicting the rainfall return period and an inundation map for observed rainfall has not been presented. Simultaneous prediction of the return period and inundation map would be a useful technique for responding to floods in real-time and could provide an expected inundation area by return period. In this study, return period estimation for observed rainfall was performed via PNN (probabilistic neural network). SVR (support vector regression) and a SOM (self-organizing map) were used to predict flood volume and inundation maps. The study area was the Gangnam area, which has experienced extensive urbanization. The database for training SVR and SOM was constructed by one-and two-dimensional flood analysis with consideration of 120 probable rainfall events. The probable rainfall events were composed with 2-100 year return periods and 1-3 hour durations. The SVR technique was used to predict flood volume according to the rainfall return period, and the SOM was used to cluster various expected flood patterns to be used for predicting inundation maps. The prediction results were compared with the simulation results of a two-dimensional flood analysis model. The highest fitness of the predicted flood maps in the study area was calculated at 85.94%. The proposed method was found to constitute a practical methodology that could be helpful in improving urban flood response capabilities.

A solution to address this is to develop effective approaches to reconstruct high-resolution DEMs from their low-resolution equivalents that are more widely available. However, the current high-resolution DEM reconstruction approaches mainly focus on natural topography. Few attempts have been made for urban topography, which is typically an integration of complex artificial and natural features. This study proposed a novel multi-scale mapping approach based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to deal with the complex features of urban topography and to reconstruct high-resolution urban DEMs. The proposed multi-scale CNN model was firstly trained using urban DEMs that contained topographic features at different resolutions, and then used to reconstruct the urban DEM at a specified (high) resolution from a low-resolution equivalent. A two-level accuracy assessment approach was also designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed urban DEM reconstruction method, in terms of numerical accuracy and morphological accuracy. The proposed DEM reconstruction approach was applied to a 121 km2 urbanized area in London, United Kingdom. Compared with other commonly used methods, the current CNN-based approach produced superior results, providing a cost-effective innovative method to acquire high-resolution DEMs in other data-scarce regions.

They are driven by the space-time structure of catchment rainfall, which is determined by large-scale, or even global-scale, atmospheric processes. The identification of coherent, large-scale atmospheric circulation structures that determine the moisture transport and convergence associated with rainfall-induced flooding can help improve its predictability and phenomenology. In this paper, we extend a methodology, used for the analysis of extreme rainfall events, to high streamflow events (HSEs). The approach combines multiple machine learning methods to link HSEs to atmospheric circulation patterns. An application to the German streamflow network using reanalysis data for the period 1960 to 2012 is presented. Daily streamflow from 166 gauges, homogeneously distributed across Germany, are used. Geopotential height fields and integrated vapor transport (IVT) are derived from reanalysis data. An unsupervised neural network, Self Organizing Maps, is applied to geopotential height to identify a finite number of circulation patterns (CPs). Event synchronization between CPs and HSEs is used to establish if they are linked or not. If they are linked, the Event Synchronization method computes the delay between the occurrence of a CP and a HSE. Finally, local logistic regression is used to estimate the probability of occurrence of a HSE, as function of CP and IVT. We demonstrate that our approach is very effective to evaluate HSE probability occurrence across Germany. Â©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Due to the severity of these hazards, continuous observation and detailed analysis of glacier fluctuations are crucial. Many such analyses require an accurately delineated glacier boundary. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of glaciers, particularly debris-covered glaciers (DCGs), poses a challenge for glacier mapping when using conventional remote sensing or machine-learning techniques. Some examples exist about small-scale automated glacier mapping, but large or regional-scale mapping is challenging. Previously, a deep-learning-based approach named GlacierNet2 had been developed to accurately delineate the complete DCG outlines on the regional scope via taking advantage of multiple models. This paper uses a modified version of GlacierNet2 to study the feasibility and effectiveness of large-scale glacier mapping in Nepal Himalaya, Karakoram, and parts of western Himalaya. Also, we propose a large-scale mapping strategy to progressively enhance the network familiarity to varied types of glaciers via systematically repeating the training process. This strategy allows the network to delineate a large number of glaciers while only requiring a small proportion of initial training data. Thus, resulting in a significant drop in labor and expert intervention, which are required for selecting and labeling the training data. Our results show a successful and accurate generation of glacier boundaries with an intersection over union (IOU) score of 0.8115 in the Karakoram and parts of western Himalaya and an IOU of 0.7525 in the Nepal Himalaya.

Even though Alaska hosts 65% of U.S. wetlands, less than half of the wetlands in Alaska have been mapped by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) or other high-resolution wetlands protocols. The availability of time series satellite data and the development of machine learning algorithms have enabled the characterization of Arctic wetland inundation dynamics and vegetation types with limited ground data input. In this study, we built a semi-automatic process to generate sub-pixel water fraction (SWF) maps across the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska using random forest regression and 139 Sentinel-2 images taken in ice-free seasons from 2016 to 2019. With this, we characterized the seasonal dynamics of wetland inundation and explored their potential usage in determining NWI water regimes. The highest levels of surface water expression were detected in June, resulting from seasonal active layer thaw and snowmelt. Inundation was most variable in riverbeds, lake and pond margins, and depressional wetlands, where water levels fluctuate substantially between dry and wet seasons. NWI water regimes that indicate frequent inundation, such as permanently flooded wetlands, had high SWF values (SWF >= 90%), while those with infrequent inundation, such as temporarily flooded wetlands, had low SWF values (SWF < 10%). Vegetation types were also classified through the synergistic use of a vegetation index, water regimes, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data, topographic data, and a random forest classifier. The random forest classification algorithms demonstrated good performance in classifying Arctic wetland vegetation types, with an overall accuracy of 0.87. Compared with NWI data produced in the 1980s, scrub-shrub wetlands appear to have increased from 91 to 258 km(2) over the last three decades, which is the largest percentage change (182%) among all vegetation types. However, additional field data are needed to confirm this shift in vegetation type.

We separate regions of different dominant characteristics through unsupervised clustering, and investigate feature importance rankings for classifying damage via supervised machine learning. Besides the expected effect of precipitation, the classification algorithms select the topographic wetness index as most important feature, especially in low elevation areas. The slope length and steepness factor ranks high for mountains and canyons. Partial dependence plots further hint at amplified vulnerability in rural areas.

Such a system needs to produce acceptable results in all regions of the country and particularly in the Prairie Potholes Region where understanding water surface dynamics is important for predicting flooding, agriculture/water availability and for evaporation calculations in weather models. A system was developed to automate, ingest, and process Radarsat-2 (RS2) imagery, from which mapping open water body extents in near-real time was carried out using a machine learning classification technique. A Random Forest classification algorithm was trained using the data extracted from the Global Surface Water (GSW) occurrence dataset. The GSW occurrence thresholds used to extract the training data were examined and there was little influence of uncertainty on the classification. The quality of classifications generated from RS2 Fine Wide mode imagery improved with increasing incidence angle. All Fine Quad incident angles produced acceptable results, but Standard and Wide mode imagery produced results below the accuracy thresholds deemed acceptable for this operational solution. Validation was carried out by comparing mapped water extents to temporally coincident high resolution multi-spectral imagery and to the USGS Global Land Cover Characteristics dataset, that is currently used as a land-water mask by ECCC in weather numerical weather modelling. The system that has been developed will allow new image datasets (e.g. Radarsat Constellation Mission) or training data that becomes available to be used to improve models.

The Pastaza Maranon Foreland Basin (PMFB), within the Peruvian Amazon, is known to store large amounts of peat, but the remoteness of the region makes field data collection and mapping the distribution of peatland ecotypes challenging. Here we review methods for developing high accuracy peatland maps for the PMFB using a combination of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing in a machine learning classifier. The new map produced has 95% overall accuracy with low errors of commission (1-6%) and errors of omission (0-15%) for individual peatland classes. We attribute this improvement in map accuracy over previous maps of the region to the inclusion of high and low water season SAR images which provides information about seasonal hydrological dynamics. The new multi-date map showed an increase in area of more than 200% for pole forest peatland (6% error) compared to previous maps, which had high errors for that ecotype (20-36%). Likewise, estimates of C stocks were 35% greater than previously reported (3.238 Pg in Draper et al. (2014) to 4.360 Pg in our study). Most of the increase is attributed to pole forest peatland which contributed 58% (2.551 Pg) of total C, followed by palm swamp (34%, 1.476 Pg). In an assessment of deforestation from 2010 to 2018 in the PMFB, we found 89% of the deforestation was in seasonally flooded forest and 43% of deforestation was occurring within 1 km of a river or road. Peatlands were found the least affected by deforestation and there was not a noticeable trend over time. With development of improved transportation routes and population pressures, future land use change is likely to put South American tropical peatlands at risk, making continued monitoring a necessity. Accurate mapping of peatland ecotypes with high resolution (< 30 m) sensors linked with field data are needed to reduce uncertainties in estimates of the distribution of C stocks, and to aid in deforestation monitoring.",FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,10.3389/feart.2021.676748,2,1,No,"United States,England,Peru,Indonesia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data scarcity is a key concern, however, with the availability of free Earth Observation (EO) data, such challenges can be suitably addressed. In this research we have developed a robust machine learning (random forest) approach utilizing EO and Geographic Information System (GIS) data, which enables an innovative means for our simulations to be driven only by historical drivers of change and hotspot prediction based on probability to change. We used the Mekong region as a case study to generate a training and validation sample from historical land cover patterns of change and used this information to train a random forest machine learning model. Data samples were created from the SERVIR-Mekong land cover data series. Data sets were created for 2 categories both containing 8 classes. The 2 categories included-any generic class to change into a specific one and vice versa. Classes included the following: Aquaculture; Barren; Cropland; Flooded Forest; Mangroves; Forest; Plantations; Wetlands; and Urban. The training points were used to sample a series of satellite-derived surface reflectance products and other data layers such as information on slope, distance to road and census data, which represent the drivers of change. The classifier was trained in binary mode and showed a clear separation between change and no change. An independent validation dataset of historical change pixels show that all median change probabilities are greater than 80% and all lower quantiles, except one, are greater than 70%. The 2018 probability change maps show high probabilities for the Plantations and Forest classes in the 'Generic to Specific' and 'Specific to generic' category, respectively. A time-series analysis of change probability shows that forests have become more likely to convert into other classes during the last two decades, across all countries.

The continuity of the GRACE-like TWSA series with commensurate accuracy is of great importance for the improvement of hydrologic models both at global and regional scales. While previous efforts to bridge this gap, though without achieving GRACE-like spatial resolutions and/or accuracy have been performed, high-quality TWSA simulations at global scale are still lacking. Here, we use a suite of deep learning (DL) architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNN), deep convolutional autoencoders (DCAE), and Bayesian convolutional neural networks (BCNN), with training datasets including GRACE/-FO mascon and Swarm gravimetry, ECMWF Reanalysis-5 data, normalized time tag information to reconstruct global land TWSA maps, at a much higher resolution (100 km full wavelength) than that of GRACE/FO, and effectively bridge the 11-month data gap globally. Contrary to previous studies, we applied no prior detrending or de-seasoning to avoid biasing/aliasing the simulations induced by interannual or longer climate signals and extreme weather episodes. We show the contribution of Swarm and time inputs which significantly improved the TWSA simulations in particular for correct prediction of the trend component. Our results also show that external validation with independent data when filling large data gaps within spatio-temporal time series of geophysical signals is mandatory to maintain the robustness of the simulation results.

Risk-based methods account for the uncertainties embedded into engineering variables and long-term evaluations. The objective of this paper is to identify, assess, and quantify structural risk components to bridges using probabilistic risk methodologies and data from the National Bridge Inventory database. The aim is to simplify the implementation of risk-based ranking procedures into bridge management system packages according to the MAP-21 vision. Therefore, machine learning techniques are employed to facilitate the introduction of probabilistic risk methods into bridge management systems. The procedure is described for seven hazards that are pertinent to bridges in New Jersey: overloading, fatigue, seismic, flooding, scour, vehicle and vessel collision. Risk values are computed in monetary terms to homogenize the comparison among bridges for different hazards. The analysis is performed on 5,534 bridges, showing that seismic events and fatigue resulting from truck overloading are the most dominant hazards in New Jersey, for which about 97.0% and 29.0% of bridges show some level of risk. The main limitation of the proposed framework is the lack of accurate data from bridge inventories necessary to thoroughly perform a fully structural probabilistic analysis of bridges and to minimize engineering judgment.",TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,10.1177/0361198120929016,2,1,No,"Canada,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the local scale, there is an opportunity to increase the accuracy and temporal frequency of these surface water maps by using locally trained classifiers and gap-filling missing values via imputation in all available satellite images. We developed the Surface Water IMputation (SWIM) classification framework using R and the Google Earth Engine computing platform to improve water classification compared to the JRC study. The novel contributions of the SWIM classification framework include (1) a cluster-based algorithm to improve classification sensitivity to a variety of surface water conditions and produce approximately unbiased estimation of surface water area, (2) a method to gap-fill every available Landsat image for a region of interest to generate submonthly classifications at the highest possible temporal frequency, (3) an outlier detection method for identifying images that contain classification errors due to failures in cloud masking. Validation and several case studies demonstrate the SWIM classification framework outperforms the JRC dataset in spatiotemporal analyses of small waterbody dynamics with previously unattainable sensitivity and temporal frequency. Most importantly, this study shows that reliable surface water classifications can be obtained for all pixels in every available Landsat image, even those containing cloud cover, after performing gap-fill imputation. By using this technique, the SWIM framework supports monitoring water extent on a submonthly basis, which is especially applicable to assessing the impact of short-term flood and drought events.

The datasets include 9 types of disaster, such as flash floods, landslides and droughts, and the corresponding number of affected people during an 18-year or a 218-month observation period for 5,402 Brazilian municipalities, totaling more than 65,0 0 0 observations. Data on relevant geographical, demographic and socioeconomic aspects of the affected municipalities are also provided. These encompass geographic coordinates, regions, population, income, development indicators, amongst other information. From a statistical point of view, the data on disasters can address a number of applications using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as, for time series analysis or other dynamic models using socioeconomic data as explanatory variables, i.e. data on the size of the poor population, income, education and gen eral development. The geographic dataset can be useful for aggregating analyses concerning the various forms of territorial organization and allows for the visualization of data in maps. All the aforementioned data can be also used to devise realistic optimization instances related to diverse humanitarian logistics and/or disaster management problems, such as facility location, location-allocation, vehicle routing, and so forth. In particular, we describe two real-world instances for the location-allocation problem studied in [1]. For that purpose, we partially use the given datasets and included other information such as costs and distances relevant to the optimization model. Although using real-world cases to test optimization approaches is a common and encouraged practice in Operations Research, comprehensive datasets and practical optimization instances, as presented in this article, are rarely described and/or available in the academic literature.

Similarly to many parts of the globe, particularly the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey is frequently exposed to major floods. The heavy rainfall and topographic structure of the region and the proximity of settlements to stream beds are the primary causes of flooding. The present study pertains to the utilization of the Logistic Regression (LR), M5P Rule Tree (M5PRT) and M5P Regression Tree (M5PRGT) models for the assessment of the flood hazard areas in and around the Of district, located on the Black Sea coast of Trabzon province. According to flood inventory, 16 flood events occurred in 5 different locations in the study area. These areas were converted into point data, and comprising a total of 1600 points, 800 flooded and 800 non-flooded, were determined by random sampling. Accordingly, flood hazard maps were created with 8 flood parameters and 3 different methods. Accuracies of these models were evaluated through AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve), ACC (Accuracy), R (Recall), P (Precision) and F (F-Score). Analyses showed that the Tree-Based Algorithms are more successful than the LR method in detecting the flood hazards. In addition, the altitude and precipitation were found out to be the most influential parameters in all 3 methods on the occurrence of flooding events in the region. The confluence points of the streams, the coastal plain where the stream disembogues to the sea and the valley floors in and around the Of district were designated as the areas with high risk of flooding.

For this, the main aim of the current research is to synthesize the three natural resources (groundwater, wetland, and forest) into one multi-resource (MR) potentiality map and three natural hazards (flood, landslide, and shoreline erosion) into one multi-hazard (MH) susceptibility map. To achieve this goal, several inventories, geo-environmental factors, satellite bands, and indices have been taken as input data sets. Random forest (RF) model has been considered for individual mapping (except shoreline erosion mapping) due to its high precision. For shoreline erosion mapping, digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) model has been employed. The accuracies of the model have been determined from the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, producer accuracy (PA), and user accuracy (UA). RF model has more than 90% prediction accuracy in different resource and hazard mapping, whereas for the forest mapping, PA and UA are 90% and 80%, respectively. The results of this study for multi-resource mapping show forest (24.05%) and groundwater (22.28%) as the major resources, whereas flood (17.27%) is the most destructive in comparison with other hazards.

With unique advantages over the optical sensors (e.g., little effect of clouds, and observations at day and night), Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provide an important data source for mapping inundation, particularly during flood periods. Freely available SAR images from Sentinel-1 have been increasingly used for many applications. This study applied an efficient transformer-based change detection method, bitemporal image transformer (BiT) with bitemporal Sentniel-1 images, to map inundation extents and evolution in Poyang Lake area in 2020. The transformer-based change detection method firstly adopted ResNet for high-level semantic features extraction, and applied a transformer mechanism to refine these features pixel-wise, followed by employing a FCN as the prediction head for generating the results of change detection. Besides, we constructed a water change detection dataset with spatial-and-temporal generalization from bitemporal Sentinel-1 images; this dataset consists of the seasonal variation water samples of Poyang Lake for years. We compared the results from the BiT method with other convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods (STANets and SNUNet). Mapped inundation extents were evaluated with the ground truth visually derived from high spatial resolution images. The evaluation showed the BiT method generated high accurate mapped inundation extents with the F1-score of 95.5%. The BiT model has proven its superior performance in detecting increased water. Based on the results of the BiT method, the variation of inundation extents in Poyang Lake during May-November 2020 was further analyzed. It was found that the water surface coverage of Poyang Lake is the smallest in late May; it gradually increased to the maximum on 14th July, and then began to stabilize and show a significant downward trend before November.

Neolissochilus benasi is a freshwater fish that prefers living in clean, flowing water and rocky bottoms with sands and gravels. Based on a segment in mtDNA obtained from eight specimens collected from northern Vietnam, the present study applied a hybrid novel, genetic algorithm (GA)âartificial neural network (ANN) to understand impacts of floods on N. benasi. The GAâANN hybrid model was successful in mapping flood susceptibility, which correlates with river density, altitude, and rainfall, being typical in lowlands, along rivers and streams. Strong correlations were found between fish and urban density, agriculture, and land use/land cover, which contribute to the decrease of N. benasi. Habitat destruction, hydropower dams, pollution, overfishing, and using destructive gears are probably the main causes of the N. benasi decline. Importantly, based on GAâANN model, flooding had a significant impact on N. benasi, which performs a low genetic diversity in the studied regions. Thus, this endangered freshwater fish species would have been easily affected by flooding since very high and high susceptibility of N. benasi was abundant in the province, particularly along the Red River and urban areas. This is the first study to examine the link between flooding and genetic diversity of an aquatic organism in Vietnam applying deep learning models. Accordingly, these results recommend significant suggestions to protect N. benasi in its habitats from northern Vietnam under flooding.

This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap through the development and comparative performance of these models. This approach created the flood inventory map using satellite images and field observations. A geodatabase was used to create flood predictors such as aspect, altitude, distance to rivers, topographic wetness index (TWI), flow accumulation, lithology, distance to road, land use, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope, rainfall, soil type, Topographic Position Index (TPI), and Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI). The developed models were trained using 80% of the data and evaluated using the remaining 20% to create a flood susceptibility map. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the map's accuracy. The results of this study indicated that the traditional (Elastic-net Classifier) model possessed high accuracy (AUC = 0.9457, F1 = 0.8916, Sensitivity = 0.9024, and Precision = 0.881) than the ensemble algorithm (Light Gradient Boosting on Elastic-net Predictions) (AUC = 0.9629, F1 = 0.9538, Sensitivity = 0.9688, and Precision = 0.9394). Based on the results of this study it can be concluded that these algorithms has a strong potential to offer a practical and affordable method for geospatial modeling of flood vulnerability.

Although existing supervised methods, especially deep convolutional neural networks, have proved to be effective, they require intensive manual labeling of flooded pixels to train a multi-layer deep neural network that learns abstract semantic features of the input data. This research introduces a novel weakly supervised approach for pixel-wise flood mapping by leveraging multi-temporal remote sensing imagery and image processing techniques (e.g., Normalized Difference Water Index and edge detection) to create weakly labeled data. Using these weakly labeled data, a bi-temporal U-Net model is then proposed and trained for flood detection without the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive human annotations. Using floods from Hurricanes Florence and Harvey as case studies, we evaluated the performance of the proposed bi-temporal U-Net model and baseline models, such as decision tree, random forest, gradient boost, and adaptive boosting classifiers. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a comprehensive assessment that (1) covered multiple test sites with varying degrees of urbanization, and (2) utilized both bi-temporal (i.e., pre- and post-flood) and uni-temporal (i.e., only post-flood) input. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework of weakly labeled data generation and the bi-temporal U-Net could produce near real-time urban flood maps with consistently high precision, recall, f1 score, IoU score, and overall accuracy compared with baseline machine learning algorithms.

This study developed a framework for evaluating flood susceptibility in the GBA using tree-based machine learning (ML) and geographical information system techniques. Based on the flood inventory, tree-based models, namely random forest, gradient boost decision tree, extreme gradient boosting, and categorical boosting considering topography, exposure, and vulnerability as influential factors, were used to train and test ML models, and the trained models were then used to predict flood susceptibility. All tree-based ML models achieved good performance, with accuracy values greater than 0.79. The categorical boosting model performed the best than other models to predict flood susceptibility. The flood susceptibility maps showed that more than 16% of the areas of the GBA were classified as having high flood susceptibility, and almost 70% of the historical floods were located in areas with high flood susceptibility. The model interpretation of the summary of Shapley additive explanation values indicated that the influential factors of elevation, population density, and typhoon intensity had a strong influence on flood susceptibility. The obtained spatial flood susceptibilities provide suggestions for flood disaster mitigation in the GBA.

Therefore, our objective was to detect riverine litter by utilizing middle-scale multispectral satellite images and machine learning (ML), with the Tisza River (Hungary) as a study area. The Very High Resolution (VHR) images obtained from the Google Earth database were employed to recognize some riverine litter spots (a blend of anthropogenic and natural substances). These litter spots served as the basis for training and validating five supervised machine-learning algorithms based on Sentinel-2 images [Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest (RF), NaÃ¯ve Bays (NB) and Decision Tree (DT)]. To evaluate the generalization capability of the developed models, they were tested on larger unseen data under varying hydrological conditions and with different litter sizes. Besides the best-performing model was used to investigate the spatio-temporal variations of riverine litter in the Middel Tisza. According to the results, almost all the developed models showed favorable metrics based on the validation dataset (e.g., F1-score; SVC: 0.94, ANN: 0.93, RF: 0.91, DT: 0.90, and NB: 0.83); however, during the testing process, they showed medium (e.g., F1-score; RF:0.69, SVC: 0.62; ANN: 0.62) to poor performance (e.g., F1-score; NB: 0.48; DT: 0.45). The capability of all models to detect litter was bounded to the pixel size of the Sentinel-2 images. Based on the spatio-temporal investigation, hydraulic structures (e.g., KiskÃ¶re Dam) are the greatest litter accumulation spots. Although the highest transport rate of litter occurs during floods, the largest litter spot area upstream of the KiskÃ¶re Dam was observed at low stages in summer. This study represents a preliminary step in the automatic detection of riverine litter; therefore, additional research incorporating a larger dataset with more representative small litter spots, as well as finer spatial resolution images is necessary.

Therefore, integration of deep learning â an updated version of machine learning techniques â and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) models can generate high-resolution flood risk maps. In this study, a novel integrated approach has been developed based on multiplicative long short-term memory (mLSTM) deep learning models and an MCDM ensemble model to map flood risk in the Minab-Shamil plain, southern Iran. A flood hazard map generated by the mLSTM model is based on nine critical features selected by GrootCV (distance to the river, vegetation cover, variables extracted from DEM (digital elevation model) and river density) and a flood inventory map (70% and 30% data were randomly selected as training and test datasets, respectively). The values of all criteria used to assess model accuracy performance (except Cohens kappa for train dataset = 86, and for test dataset = 84) achieved values greater than 90, which indicates that the mLSTM model performed very well for the generation of a spatial flood hazard map. According to the spatial flood hazard map produced by mLSTM, the very low, low, moderate, high and very high classes cover 26%, 35.3%, 20.5%, 11.2% and 7% of the total area, respectively. Flood vulnerability maps were produced by the combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS), the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS), and the multi-objective optimization on the basis of simple ratio analysis (MOOSRA), and then validated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (SRC). Based on the SRC, the three models CODAS, EDAS, and MOOSRA showed high-ranking correlations with each other, and all three models were then used in the ensemble process. According to the CODAS-EDAS-MOOSRA ensemble model, 21.5%, 34.2%, 23.7%, 13%, and 7.6% of the total area were classified as having a very low to very high flood vulnerability, respectively. Finally, a flood risk map was generated by the combination of flood hazard and vulnerability maps produced by the mLSTM and MCDM ensemble model. According to the flood risk map, 27.4%, 34.3%, 14.8%, 15.7%, and 7.8% of the total area were classified as having a very low, low, moderate, high, and very high flood risk, respectively.

Satellite imagery, which is consistent with good spatial resolution and helpful in providing frequent information with temporal imagery, is a better solution for monitoring these shrimp ponds remotely for a larger spatial extent. The shrimp ponds of Cai Doi Vam township, Ca Mau Province, Viet Nam, were mapped using DMC-3 (TripleSat) and Jilin-1 high-resolution satellite imagery for the years 2019 and 2022. The 3 m spatial resolution shrimp pond extent product showed an overall accuracy of 87.5%, with a producerâs accuracy of 90.91% (errors of omission = 11.09%) and a userâs accuracy of 90.91% (errors of commission = 11.09%) for the shrimp pond class.

However, human activities have resulted in wetland loss in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB), while the wetland distribution in this area shows great discrepancy in previous estimates. It is, therefore, imperative to estimate the distribution of potential wetlands at present and project their variation under future climate change scenarios. In this study, we simulate the wetland distribution in the MLYRB at 15â³ resolution using 5 machine learning methods with 19 predicting factors of topographic index, vegetation index, climate data, hydrological data, and soil type data. A 5-fold cross-validation with observed permanent wetlands shows that the reconstructions from Adaptive Boosting tree (AdaBoost) algorithm have the highest accuracy of 97.5%. The potential wetland area in the MLYRB is approximately ~1.25 Ã 105 km2, accounting for 15.66% of the study region. Direct human activities have led to the loss of nearly half of the potential wetlands. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments with the well-trained models are performed to quantify the response of the total wetland area to each influencing factor. Results indicate vulnerability of wetland areas to increases in leaf area index (LAI), coldest season temperature, warmest season temperature, and solar radiation. By the 2100s, the potential wetland area is expected to decrease by 40.5% and 50.6% under the intermediate and very high emissions scenarios, respectively. The changes in LAI and the coldest season temperature will contribute to 50% and 40% of this loss of potential wetlands, respectively. Wetland loss may further undermine biodiversity, such as waterfowl, and fail to provide functions such as flood protection, and water supply. This work reveals the spatial pattern of potential wetland areas and their sensitivity to climate changes, stressing the need for effective strategies to mitigate wetland loss at specific regions in the MLYRB.

Among the ensemble models created, the ensemble ANN model substantially increased performed best when sued with training and test sets. It was observed from the flood susceptibility maps that the flood areas formed by ensemble models were more distributed than those created by a single machine learning algorithm, and with the help of ensemble models, the distribution of the parameters affecting the floods at the flood points more elucidating. Furthermore, the McNemar test was applied to assess the differences between the predictions of the generated models using test data.

In order to increase confidence in pluvial flood susceptibility mapping, overland flow models need to be intensively evaluated using observations from past events. However, most remote-sensing-based flood detection techniques only focus on the identification of degradations and/or water pixels in the close vicinity of overflowing streams after heavy rainfall. Many occurrences of pluvial-flood-induced damages such as soil erosion, gullies, landslides and mudflows located further away from the stream are thus often unrevealed. To fill this gap, a transferable remote sensing fusion method called FuSVIPR, for Fusion of Sentinel-2 & Very high resolution Imagery for Pluvial Runoff, is developed to produce damage-detection maps. Based on very high spatial resolution optical imagery (from PlÃ©iades satellites or airborne sensors) combined with 10 m change images from Sentinel-2 satellites, the Random Forest and U-net machine/deep learning techniques are separately trained and compared to locate pluvial flood footprints on the ground at 0.5 m spatial resolution following heavy weather events. In this work, three flash flood events in the Aude and Alpes-Maritimes departments in the South of France are investigated, covering over more than 160 km2 of rural and periurban areas between 2018 and 2020. Pluvial-flood-detection accuracies hover around 75% (with a minimum area detection ratio for annotated ground truths of 25%), and false-positive rates mostly below 2% are achieved on all three distinct events using a cross-site validation framework. FuSVIPR is then further evaluated on the latest devastating flash floods of April 2022 in the Durban area (South Africa), without additional training. Very good agreement with the impact maps produced in the context of the International Charter âSpace and Major Disastersâ are reached with similar performance figures. These results emphasize the high generalization capability of this method to locate pluvial floods at any time of the year and over diverse regions worldwide using a very high spatial resolution visible product and two Sentinel-2 images. The resulting impact maps have high potential for helping thorough evaluation and improvement of surface water inundation models and boosting extreme precipitation downscaling at a very high spatial resolution.

Inflow forecasting in real-time is essential for the effective management of reservoir water. The emergence of high spatial resolution weather forecasts and explainable Machine Learning (eXML) algorithms remove the barriers to accurate forecasting and provide a better understanding of Machine Learning (ML) models. In this context, reservoir inflows are forecasted using eXML models and Global Forecasting System (GFS) data: precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature. Popular ML methods like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vectors Machine and Random Forest are used in this study. Further, these models' explainability is assessed using the Shapley additive explanations method. The ML models are trained and tested using the observed data from 2000 to 2018 in the Tenughat catchment, Damodar river basin, India. Among all the ML models, the LSTM model better predicted the inflows with an NSE value of 0.938. The eXML revealed that inflow and precipitation variables of 1-day lag significantly impact the modelsâ prediction in all models. The GFS data of 2017â2018 was bias-corrected using the Scaled Distribution Mapping method, and the method improved the GFS data significantly. The inflow forecasting using the LSTM model with the bias-corrected GFS data revealed that the LSTM model performed well up to 3-day lead time (NSE = 0.908, 0.888, 0.876 for 1â3Â day lead). Thus, the LSTM model with the GFS forecasts has substantial potential for real-time forecasting of reservoir inflows.

The effects of floods are more prominent in countries of the Global South, where large parts of the population and infrastructure are insufficiently protected from natural hazards. From this scope, a lot of effort is required to mitigate these impacts by continuously providing new and more reliable tools to aid in mitigation and preparedness, during or after a flood event. Flood mapping followed by damage assessment plays an important role in all these stages. In this work we investigate a new dataset provided by DrivenData Labs based on Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery (VH, VV imagery and labels) to help map floods in the city of Beira in Mozambique. Exploiting Google Earth Engine (GEE), we deployed supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) methods on a dataset comprising imagery from 13 countries worldwide. We first mapped the floods country-by-country including Mozambique. This first part was helpful to understand the sensitivity of each method when applied to data from different regions and with different polarizations. We then trained the supervised model globally (in all 13 countries) and used it to predict floods in Beira. To assess the accuracy of the experiments we used the intersection over the union (IoU) metric, results of which we compared with the benchmark IoU achieved by the winner in the DrivenData competition for flood mapping in 2021. The implementation of unsupervised and supervised ML using VH and VV+VH produced satisfactory results, and showed to be better than using VV imagery; in Cambodia and Bolivia with VH polarization yielded IoUs values ranging from 0.819 to 0.856 which is above the benchmark (0.8094). The predictions in Beira using VH imagery yielded IoU of 0.568, which is a reasonable outcome. The proposed approach is a reliable alternative for flood mapping, especially in Mozambique due to its low cost and time effectiveness as even with unsupervised approaches, relatively high-quality results are yielded in near real-time. Finally, we used Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery for a land cover classification to perform damage assessment in Beira and integrated population data from Beira to enhance the quality the results. The results show that 20% of agricultural area and about 10% of built up area were flooded. Flooded built up area includes highly populated neighborhoods such as Chaimite and Ponta Gea that are located in the center of the city.

Previous research on UPF prediction has mainly focused on hydrological models, which required a large amount of data. However, a data-driven method can significantly reduce the computational cost by using rainfall amounts to predict pluvial flooding. Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves using the Gumbel method can provide a better interpretation of the correlation between rainfall intensity, duration, and probability of occurrence of a given rainfall amount. In this study, machine learning models (ML) for rainfall amounts were used to identify flood points in a case study conducted in Karachi, Pakistan. Thirteen inundation factors were used for the ML models, including a new factor, curve number. Ten ML models were applied first on training and then on validation data, yielding the inundation points. The training and validation process of the model included 384 flood points. Several statistics were used to verify the performance and accuracy of the model. We found that the Light Gradient Boost Machine and Random Forest Classifier models were the most accurate in training and validating the model, while the Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor models were the least accurate in training and validating the model. The study provides valuable information for decision makers to protect communities from flood hazards by incorporating the likely intensity and duration of rainfall events and carefully selecting influencing factors into flood event prediction models.

To achieve this goal, we aim to develop a novel approach using machine learning classification (i.e., random forest). We used existing fragmented flood hazard maps along the Ottawa River to train a random forest classification model using a range of flood conditioning factors. We then applied this classification across the Capital Region to fill in the spatial gaps between existing flood hazard maps and generate a harmonized high-resolution (1 m) 100 year flood susceptibility map. When validated against recently produced 100 year flood hazard maps across the capital region, we find that this random forest classification approach yields a highly accurate flood susceptibility map. We argue that the machine learning classification approach is a promising technique to fill in the spatial gaps between existing flood hazard maps and create harmonized high-resolution flood susceptibility maps across flood-vulnerable areas. However, caution must be taken in selecting suitable flood conditioning factors and extrapolating classification to areas with similar characteristics to the training sites. The resulted harmonized and spatially continuous flood susceptibility map has wide-reaching relevance for flood mitigation planning in the capital region. The machine learning approach and flood classification optimization method developed in this study is also a first step toward Natural Resources Canadaâs aim of creating a spatially continuous flood susceptibility map across the Ottawa River watershed. Our modeling approach is transferable to harmonize flood maps and fill in spatial gaps in other regions of the world and will help mitigate flood disasters by providing accurate flood data for urban planning.

However, due to model uncertainties arising from, e.g., initial value and model errors, the simulation results do not match the in situ or remotely sensed observations to arbitrary accuracy. Merging model-based data with observations yield promising results benefiting simultaneously from the information content of the model results and observations. Machine learning (ML) and/or deep learning (DL) methods have been shown to be useful tools in closing the gap between models and observations due to the capacity in the representation of the non-linear spaceâtime correlation structure. This study focused on using UNet encoderâdecoder convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for extracting spatiotemporal features from model simulations for predicting the actual mismatches (errors) between the simulation results and a reference data set. Here, the climate simulations over Europe from the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP) were used as input to the CNN. The COSMO-REA6 reanalysis data were used as a reference. The proposed merging framework was applied to mismatches in precipitation and surface pressure representing more and less chaotic variables, respectively. The merged data show a strong average improvement in mean error (~ 47%), correlation coefficient (~ 37%), and root mean square error (~22%). To highlight the performance of the DL-based method, the results were compared with the results obtained by a baseline method, quantile mapping. The proposed DL-based merging methodology can be used either during the simulation to correct model forecast output online or in a post-processing step, for downstream impact applications, such as flood forecasting, water resources management, and agriculture.

Robust flood simulation is required for effective response and prevention. Machine learning is widely used in flood modeling due to its high performance and scalability. Nonetheless, data pre-processing of heterogeneous sources can be cumbersome, and traditional data processing and modeling have been limited to a single resolution. This study employed an Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area Aperture 3 Hexagonal Discrete Global Grid System (ISEA3H DGGS) as a scalable, standard spatial framework for computation, integration, and analysis of multi-source geospatial data. We managed to incorporate external machine learning algorithms with a DGGS-based data framework, and project future flood risks under multiple climate change scenarios for southern New Brunswick, Canada. A total of 32 explanatory factors including topographical, hydrological, geomorphic, meteorological, and anthropogenic were investigated. Results showed that low elevation and proximity to permanent waterbodies were primary factors of flooding events, and rising spring temperatures can increase flood risk. Flooding extent was predicted to occupy 135â203% of the 2019 flood area, one of the most recent major flooding events, by the year 2100.

Precisely, Colombia is one of the most affected by this type of natural hazard, as well as by floods, since they are the natural phenomena that bring with them the most severe risks for communities. In this work, we articulated the statistical approach of the landslide conditioning factors, Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA), and Geographic Information System (GIS), evaluating a flexible and agile methodology to estimate the landslide susceptibility defining areas prone to the landslide occurrence. The MLA were validated in a case study in the âLa Liborianaâ River basin, located in the Municipality of Salgar in the Colombian mountains Andes where Landslide Susceptibility Maps (LSMs) were obtained. The obtained MLA results hold immense potential in the field of regional landslide mapping, facilitating the development of effective strategies aimed at minimizing the devastating impacts on human lives, infrastructure, and the natural environment. By leveraging these findings, proactive measures can be devised to safeguard vulnerable areas, mitigate risks, and ensure the safety and well-being of communities.

Raising the First-Floor Elevation (FFE) above the base flood elevation (BFE) is an effective mitigation measure for buildings with a high risk of flooding. In the U.S., measuring FFE is necessary to obtain an Elevation Certificate (E.C.) for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and has traditionally required labor-consuming field surveys. However, the advances in computer vision technology have facilitated the handling of large image datasets, leading to new FFE measurement approaches. Taking Galveston Island (including the cities of Galveston and Jamaica Beach) in Coastal Texas as a case study, we explore how these new approaches may inform flood risk management and governance, including how FFE estimates may be combined with BFE estimates from flood inundation probability mapping to model the predicted cost of raising buildingsâ FFE above their BFE. After establishing the FFE modelâs accuracy by comparing its results with previously validated FFE estimates in three districts of Galveston, we generalize the workflow to building footprints across Galveston Island. By combining the FFE data derived from our workflow with multidimensional building information, we further analyze the future flood control and post-disaster maintenance strategies. Our findings present valuable data collection paradigms and methodological concepts that inform flood governance for Galveston Island.

The original data of 14 environmental factors, such as elevation, slope, aspect, gully density, and highway density, are chosen as input variables for the MLP, LR, SVM, and RF models in order to estimate and map the distribution of the flash flood susceptibility index in Longnan County, Jiangxi Province, China. Finally, the prediction performance of various models and modeling rules is evaluated using the ROC curve and the susceptibility index distribution features. The findings show that: 1) Machine learning models can accurately assess the regionâs vulnerability to flash floods. The MLP, LR, SVM, and RF models all predict susceptibility very well. 2) The MLP (AUC=0.973, MV=0.1017, SD=0.2627) model has the best prediction performance for flash flood susceptibility, followed by the SVM (AUC=0.964, MV=0.1090, SD=0.2561) and RF (AUC=0.975, MV=0.2041, SD=0.1943) models, and the LR (AUC=0.882, MV=0.2613, SD=0.2913) model. 3) To a large extent, environmental factors such as elevation, gully density, and population density influence flash flood susceptibility.

Machine learning methods have been widely applied in flood susceptibility modeling, but traditional supervised learning requires both positive (flood) and negative (non-flood) samples in model training. Historical flood inventory data usually contain positive-only data, whereas negative data selected from areas without flood records are prone to be contaminated by positive data, which is referred to as case-control sampling with contaminated controls. In order to address this problem, we propose to apply a novel positive-unlabeled learning algorithm, namely positive and background learning with constraints (PBLC), in flood susceptibility modeling. PBLC trains a binary classifier from case-control positive and unlabeled samples without requiring truly labeled negative data. With historical records of flood locations and environmental covariates, including elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, slope length factor, stream power index, topographic position index, topographic wetness index, distance to rivers, distance to roads, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, and precipitation, we compared the performances of the traditional artificial neural network (ANN) and the novel PBLC in flood susceptibility modeling in the city of Guangzhou, China. Experimental results show that PBLC can produce more calibrated probabilistic prediction, more accurate binary prediction, and more reliable susceptibility mapping of urban flooding than traditional ANN, indicating that PBLC is effective in addressing the problem of case-control sampling with contaminated controls and it can be successfully applied in urban flood susceptibility mapping.

The study was conducted for two watersheds in Canada, namely Lower Nicola River, BC and Loup, QC. Three statistical metrics were used to validate the models: Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, Figure of Merit, and F1-score. Findings indicated that the RF model had the highest accuracy in providing the flood susceptibility maps (FSMs). Moreover, the provided FSMs indicated that flooding is more likely to occur in the Lower Nicola River watershed than the Loup watershed. Following the RCP4.5 scenario, the area percentages of the flood susceptibility classes in the Loup watershed in 2050 and 2080 have changed by the following percentages from the year 2020 and 2050, respectively: Very Low = â1.68%, Low = â5.82%, Moderate = +6.19%, High = +0.71%, and Very High = +0.6% and Very Low = â1.61%, Low = +2.98%, Moderate = â3.49%, High = +1.29%, and Very High = +0.83%. Likewise, in the Lower Nicola River watershed, the changes between the years 2020 and 2050 and between the years 2050 and 2080 were: Very Low = â0.38%, Low = â0.81%, Moderate = â0.95%, High = +1.72%, and Very High = +0.42% and Very Low = â1.31%, Low = â1.35%, Moderate = â1.81%, High = +2.37%, and Very High = +2.1%, respectively. The impact of climate changes on future flood-prone places revealed that the regions designated as highly and very highly susceptible to flooding, grow in the forecasts for both watersheds. The main contribution of this study lies in the novel insights it provides concerning the flood susceptibility of watersheds in British Columbia and Quebec over time and under various climate change scenarios.

Flood inundation mapping is critical for better understanding which areas are prone to flooding and identifying emerging floods. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and timeliness of the production of these maps. In this study a new architecture, named Explainable Flood Inundation Mapping Network (XFIMNet) is presented, which is an explainable deep learning segmentation model for producing flood inundation maps from both synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral optical images. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models is performed, where the versatility of the model is demonstrated, in that it achieves superior performance across both image types, while the SOTA models are less consistent. The models are further evaluated with only the red, green, and blue (RGB) bands of the Sentinel-2 images, demonstrating that the full 13-band image is the superior choice for training a deep learning model. XFIMNet achieves an Intersection Over Union (IOU) of 0.59 with SAR images, 0.7 with optical, and 0.47 with the RGB bands, outperforming each of the SOTA models, as well as providing the most detailed and accurate visual segmentation mask, with minimal increase in the computation time for training or inference. The findings of this study highlight that XFIMNet is not only able to provide the most accurate segmentation mask but also prioritizes the most appropriate features when making decisions across both image types.

Thus, 2 hybrid models represented by Iterative Classifier OptimizerâMulticlass Alternating Decision TreeâCertainty Factor (ICO-LADT-CF) and Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy ProcessâCertainty Factor (FAHP-CF) were generated, which had as input data the values of 10 flood predictors and a number of 158 points where historical floods occurred. In the first step, the Certainty Factor values were calculated, which were then used in the Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process and Multiclass Alternating Decision Tree models. It should be mentioned that the Multiclass Alternating Decision Tree model was optimized with the help of the Iterative Classifier Optimizer. In the case of both ensemble models the slope angle was the most important flood conditioning factor. Moreover, according to Certainty Factor modelling the 8 classes/categories achieved the maximum value of 1. Next, the susceptibility to floods on the surface of the study area was derived. On average, about 20% of the study area has areas with high and medium susceptibility to flash floods. After evaluating the quality of the models through Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve, the following results emerged: Success Rate for Flood Potential Index (FPI) Iterative Classifier OptimizerâMulticlass Alternating Decision TreeâCertainty Factor (ICO-LADT-CF) (Area Under Curve = 0.985) and Flood Potential Index (FPI) Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy ProcessâCertainty Factor (FAHP-CF) (Area Under Curve = 0.967); Prediction Rate for Flood Potential Index (FPI) Iterative Classifier OptimizerâMulticlass Alternating Decision TreeâCertainty Factor (ICO-LADT-CF) (Area Under Curve = 0.952) and Flood Potential Index Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy ProcessâCertainty Factor (FAHP-CF) (Area Under Curve = 0.913).

Remote sensing has the great advantages of broad spatial coverage and regular revisit to meet the demand of large-scale and long-term tasks of earth observation. Although there already exist some methods for coarse-grained identification of reservoirs at region-level in remote sensing images, it remains a challenge to recognize and localize reservoirs accurately with insufficiency of object details and samples annotated. This study focuses on the fine-grained identification and location of reservoirs with a two-stage CNN framework method, which is comprised of a coarse classification between aquatic and land areas of image patches and a fine detection of reservoirs in aquatic patches with precise geographical coordinates. Moreover, a NIR RCNN detection network is proposed to make use of the multi-spectral characteristics of Sentinel-2 images. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we construct a reservoir and dam dataset of 36 Sentinel-2 images which are sampled in various provinces across China and annotated at the instance level by manual work. The experimental results in the test set show that the two-stage CNN method achieves an average recall of 80.83% nationwide, and the comparison between reservoirs recognized by the proposed model and those provided by the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research verifies that the model reaches a recall of about 90%. Both the indicator evaluation and visualization of identification results have shown the applicability of the proposed method to reservoir recognition in remote sensing images. Being the first attempt to make a fine-grained identification of reservoirs at the instance level, the two-stage CNN framework, which can automatically identify and localize reservoirs in remote sensing images precisely, shows the prospect to be a useful tool for large-scale and long-term reservoir monitoring.

In the aftermath of the event, authoritative information including Earth Observation (EO) data can be used to estimate precisely the flood extent, possibly after several hours. This study aims to determine how social media information can reduce the inherent uncertainty of the information in the immediate aftermath of an urban flood event. Specifically, the study investigates how to collect relevant social media images and to interpolate such data in order to create a map. The premise of the study is that social media platforms, when combined with digital surface models, can provide control points for creating a reliable near real-time estimate of the flood extent. In the study, we compared a flood extent map derived from social media with that derived from authoritative altimetry data during one of the worst floods to hit Venice, which occurred in November 2019. The results of the experiments show a good overall accuracy using several digital surface models. Given the global coverage of such models and the low resources required, we think the methodology proposed could be beneficial for emergency managers. Specifically, we describe how a flood extent map can be made available within 24 h, or even less, after urban flooding strikes a densely inhabited area, where data generated by the public are available.

In this study, three Machine Learning (ML) methods namely Deep Learning Neural Network (DL), Correlation-based Feature Weighted Naive Bayes (CFWNB), and Adaboost (AB-CFWNB) were used for the development of flash flood susceptibility maps for hilly road section (115 km length) of National Highway (NH)-6 inHoa Binh province, Vietnam.

The performance of themodels was evaluated using standard statisticalmeasures including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, Area Under Curve (AUC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results revealed that all the models performed well (AUC > 0.80) in predicting flash flood susceptibility zones, but the performance of the DL model is the best (AUC: 0.972, RMSE: 0.352).

Accurate floodwater extent maps are essential information sources for emergency management agencies and flood relief programs to direct their resources to the most affected areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are superior to optical data for floodwater mapping, especially in vegetated areas and in forests that are adjacent to urban areas and critical infrastructures. Investigating floodwater mapping with various available SAR sensors and comparing their performance allows the identification of suitable SAR sensors that can be used to map inundated areas in different land covers, such as forests and vegetated areas. In this study, we investigated the performance of polarization configurations for flood boundary delineation in vegetated and open areas derived from Sentinel1b, C-band, and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) L-band data collected during flood events resulting from Hurricane Florence in the eastern area of North Carolina. The datasets from the sensors for the flooding event collected on the same day and same study area were processed and classified for five landcover classes using a machine learning methodâthe Random Forest classification algorithm. We compared the classification results of linear, dual, and full polarizations of the SAR datasets. The L-band fully polarized data classification achieved the highest accuracy for flood mapping as the decomposition of fully polarized SAR data allows land cover features to be identified based on their scattering mechanisms.

Open remote sensing resources such as the data provided by the Copernicus ecosystem enable to carry out this activity, which benefits from frequent revisit times on a global scale. In the last decades, satellite imagery has been successfully applied to flood delineation problems, especially considering Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals. However, current remote mapping services rely on time-consuming manual or semi-automated approaches, requiring the intervention of domain experts. The implementation of accurate and scalable automated pipelines is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets. To address these issues, we propose MMFlood, a multimodal remote sensing dataset purposely designed for flood delineation. The dataset contains 1,748 Sentinel-1 acquisitions, comprising 95 flood events distributed across 42 countries. Along with satellite imagery, the dataset includes the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), hydrography maps, and flood delineation maps provided by Copernicus EMS, which is considered as ground truth. To provide baseline performances on the MMFlood test set, we conduct a number of experiments of the flood delineation task using state-of-art deep learning models, and we evaluate the performance gains of entropy-based sampling and multi-encoder architectures, which are respectively used to tackle two of the main challenges posed by MMFlood, namely the class unbalance and the multimodal setting. Lastly, we provide a future outlook on how to further improve the performance of the flood delineation task. Dataset and code can be found at https://github.com/edornd/mmflood.

Flood forecasting is essential to provide early warning to the people of flood-prone areas, provide enough time for preparedness, and reduce the damage to lives and properties. The flood inundation simulation is critical in presenting potential impending flooding in the study region. Furthermore, flood prioritization plays a key role in better watershed management. Looking at the present scenario, the machine learning methods like neural networks and fuzzy logic contribute profoundly to the headway of flood forecast frameworks giving better execution and financially savvy arrangements. The flood forecasting models can be developed using ANN, ANFIS and fuzzy logic. The comparative study between the developed models can also be carried out by determining different evaluation parameters. For flood forecasting using ANFIS, it is found that the coefficient of correlation values ranges from 0.85 to 0.95. In order to regulate the extent of the flooded area and the depth of the flooded water, HEC-RAS efficiently develops a flood inundation map.

To achieve this goal, an assessment system containing 12 indicators was constructed from the three perspectives of exposure, susceptibility and coping capacity. Firstly, factor spatialization is introduced in data preprocessing. Then TFN-AHP and the RF model were used to calculate the exposure, susceptibility, and coping capacity.

According to the results, the exposure, susceptibility and coping capacity in most areas are extremely low and low, accounting for 74.1%, 99% and 99%, respectively. The vulnerability is similar to the exposure that most of the regions have extremely low vulnerability and low vulnerability, accounting for 83.5%. The moderate vulnerability regions account for 8.5%, and the high vulnerability regions account for only 1%. The assessment results show that high-exposure areas mainly exhibit a linear distribution, and mainly include river valleys, cultivated land, and residential areas. Obviously, these areas are mainly distributed in the population and economic agglomeration areas and on low-altitude terrain. The distribution of high and comparatively high vulnerability zones, where economic and human activities are considerably high, are closely to the topography of the catchment. Thus, the results of this study provide scientific and technological evidence for resettlement, population distribution adjustment, and prevention and mitigation of flash floods in Linzhi.

Monitoring and understanding urban flooding in a highly localized scale is a challenging task due to the complicated urban landscape, intricate hydraulic process, and the lack of high-quality and resolution data. The emerging smart city technology such as monitoring cameras provides an unprecedented opportunity to address the data issue. However, estimating water ponding extents on land surfaces based on monitoring footage is unreliable using the traditional segmentation technique because the boundary of the water ponding, under the influence of varying weather, background, and illumination, is usually too fuzzy to identify, and the oblique angle and image distortion in the video monitoring data prevents georeferencing and object-based measurements. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised segmentation scheme for surface water extent recognition from the footage of an oblique monitoring camera. The semi-supervised segmentation algorithm was found suitable to determine the water boundary and the monoplotting method was successfully applied to georeference the pixels of the monitoring video for the virtual quantification of the local drainage process. The correlation and mechanism-based analysis demonstrate the value of the proposed method in advancing the understanding of local drainage hydraulics. The workflow and created methods in this study have a great potential to study other street-level and earth surface processes. Â© 2022 The Author(s).

However, massive shadows cast by buildings and trees over dense built-up urban areas can cause a significant underestimation of flood outcomes, and few studies for flood monitoring explore this in current state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, recent deep learning (DL) algorithms have reported superior performance in flood mapping over conventional machine learning methods. Nevertheless, acquiring a large amount of training data remains challenging in the DL paradigm. In this study, to exploit the potential of the DL algorithm in detecting all visible (including shadowed and nonshadowed) floodwater with limited training samples from aerial imagery, we designed a modified fully convolutional network and combined it with a deep semisupervised learning framework integrating consistency regularization and RandMix strategy into the floodwater detection workflow. Besides, the test-time augmentation technique was leveraged to improve the model performance in the evaluation phase. Extensive experiments on the 2013 Calgary flood demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on extracting visible floodwater in urban areas with dense shadows. Notably, our method could accurately detect more floodwater with a largely reduced number of labeled training samples, which is a considerable enhancement in the applicability and availability of DL algorithms for flood monitoring in densely shadowed urban areas.

HEC-RAS was utilized for 2D flood modeling, and its performance was evaluated by comparing simulated and remote sensing-derived flood extent maps. The simulated results were used to develop a surrogate ML-based model that predicts flood depth maps. Finally, we used this model to estimate the flood risk of Poldokhtar city as a combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability for 10000 flood scenarios.

Buildings near the floodwalls of the river and in the southwestern parts of the city have higher mean flood losses than those in other areas.

We compared RFR with multiple linear regression (MLR) and demonstrated the proposed approach in the conterminous United States (CONUS) and England, respectively. The results showed the following: (a) RFR performed better than MLR, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.85 in the CONUS and 0.76 in England. Unsatisfactory performances of MLR indicated that the relationship between the FDS and explanatory factors did not obey an explicit linear function. (b) RFR revealed river flood factors had higher importance than physical and socio-economic factors in the FDS estimation. The proposed RFR achieved the highest performance using all factors for prediction and could not provide good predictions (NSE < 0.65) using physical or socio-economic factors individually. (c) We estimated the FDS for all unlabeled sites in the CONUS and England.

Effectively extracting the area and consistently monitoring the dynamics of these lakes are of great significance in predicting and preventing GLOF events. To automatically extract the lake areas, many deep learning (DL) methods capable of capturing the multi-level features of lakes have been proposed in segmentation and classification tasks. However, the portability of these supervised DL methods need to be improved in order to be directly applied to different data sources, as they require laborious effort to collect the labeled lake masks.

In SimGL, a Siamese network was employed to learn similar objects by maximizing the similarity between the input image and its augmentations. Then, a simple Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) map was provided as the location cue instead of the labeled lake masks to constrain the model to capture the representations related to the glacial lakes and the segmentations to coincide with the true lake areas.

Therefore, monitoring the morphology of dunes is an important coastal management operation.

High-resolution uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry allows one to rapidly monitor coastal dune elevations at a fine scale and assess the vulnerability of coastal zones. However, photogrammetric methods are unable to map ground elevations beneath vegetation and only provide elevations for bare sand areas.

This method improves prediction performance by a factor of 2.5-3 over featureless time series methods. It effectively overcomes the limitations of small coverage of monitoring stations and insufficient historical waterlogging data, and can achieve more accurate short-term waterlogging prediction.

Annual fine-scale monitoring of mangroves is crucial for evaluating national conservation programs and implementing sustainable mangrove management strategies. However, annual fine-scale mapping of mangroves over large areas using remote sensing remains a challenge due to spectral similarities with coastal vegetation, tidal periodic fluctuations, and the need for consistent and dependable samples across different years. In previous research, there has been a lack of strategies that simultaneously consider spatial, temporal, and methodological aspects of mangrove extraction. Therefore, based on an approach that considers mangrove habitat, tides, and a semantic segmentation approach, we propose a method for fine-scale mangrove mapping suitable for long time-series data. This is an optimized hybrid model that integrates spatial, temporal, and methodological considerations. The model uses five sensors (GF-1, GF-2, GF-6, ZY-301, ZY-302) to combine deep learning U-Net models with mangrove habitat information and algorithms during low-tide periods. This method produces a mangrove map with a spatial resolution of 2 m. We applied this algorithm to three typical mangrove regions in the Beibu Gulf of Guangxi Province. The results showed the following: (1) The model scored above 0.9 in terms of its F1-score in all three study areas at the time of training, with an average accuracy of 92.54% for mangrove extraction. (2) The average overall accuracy (OA) for the extraction of mangrove distribution in three typical areas in the Beibu Gulf was 93.29%. When comparing the validation of different regions and years, the overall OA accuracy exceeded 89.84% and the Kappa coefficient exceeded 0.74. (3) The model results are reliable for extracting sparse and slow-growing young mangroves and narrow mangrove belts along roadsides. In some areas where tidal flooding occurs, the existing dataset underestimates mangrove extraction to a certain extent. The fine-scale mangrove extraction method provides a foundation for the implementation of fine-scale management of mangrove ecosystems, support for species diversity conservation, blue carbon recovery, and sustainable development goals related to coastal development.",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs15225271,1,1,No,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human interventions aim to buffer against or overcome these threats by providing physical protection for existing coastal infrastructure and communities, along with added ecological, social, or economic co-benefits. These interventions are a type of nature-based solution (NBS), broadly defined as actions working with nature to address societal challenges while also providing benefits for human well-being, biodiversity, and resilience. Despite the increasing popularity of NBS for coastal protection, sometimes in lieu of traditional hardened shorelines (e.g., oyster reefs instead of bulkheads), gaps remain in our understanding of whether common NBS interventions for coastal protection perform as intended. To help fill these knowledge gaps, we aim to identify, collate, and map the evidence base surrounding the performance of active NBS interventions related to coastal protection across a suite of ecological, physical, social, and economic outcomes in salt marsh, seagrass, kelp, mangrove, shellfish reef, and coral reef systems. The resulting evidence base will highlight the current knowledge on NBS performance and inform future uses of NBS meant for coastal protection.MethodsSearches for primary literature on performance of NBS for coastal protection in shallow, biogenic ecosystems will be conducted using a predefined list of indexing platforms, bibliographic databases, open discovery citation indexes, and organizational databases and websites, as well as an online search engine and novel literature discovery tool. All searches will be conducted in English and will be restricted to literature published from 1980 to present. Resulting literature will be screened against set inclusion criteria (i.e., population, intervention, outcome, study type) at the level of title and abstract followed by full text. Screening will be facilitated by a web-based active learning tool that incorporates user feedback via machine learning to prioritize articles for review. Metadata will be extracted from articles that meet inclusion criteria and summarized in a narrative report detailing the distribution and abundance of evidence surrounding NBS performance, including evidence clusters, evidence gaps, and the precision and sensitivity of the search strategy.",ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE,10.1186/s13750-023-00303-4,1,1,No,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high rate of forest destruction is caused by various factors, including weak law enforcement efforts against forestry crimes, such as illegal logging events. However, in Indonesia, illegal logging is only discovered when the perpetrator has distributed the wood products. The lack of monitoring of the overall condition of the forest has an impact on the current high level of forest destruction. Through this research, the problems related to environmental damage due to illegal logging will be described through remote sensing technology, which is currently mainly developed on the basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning, namely Google Earth Engine (GEE). Monitoring of illegal logging events will be analysed using Sentinel 1 and 2 data. Obtaining satellite imagery with relatively small cloud cover for tropical regions, such as Indonesia, is remarkably difficult. This difficulty is due to the presence of a radar sensor on Sentinel 1 images that can penetrate clouds, allowing for observation of the forest condition even in the presence of clouds. Using the random forest classification algorithm of the GEE platform, data on forest conditions in 2021 were obtained, covering an area of 2,843,938.87 ha or 63% of the total area of Sulawesi Selatan Province. An analysis using a map of the function of forest areas revealed that of the current forest area, 38.46% was non-forest estates and 61.54% was forest areas. The continued identification of illegal logging events also found 1971 spots of forest change events in the vulnerable time of the first period (January-April) with the second period (April-August), and 1680 spots of forest change events in the vulnerable period of the second period (April-August) with the third period (September-December), revealing a total incident area of 7599.28 ha.",FORESTS,10.3390/f14030652,1,1,No,Indonesia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of an inundation forecasting model has been recognized as essential to manage disaster risk. In the past, most researchers used multiple single-point forecasts to obtain surface flooding depth forecasts with spatial interpolation. In this study, a forecasting model (QPF-RIF) integrating a hydrodynamic model (SOBEK), support vector machineâmulti-step forecast (SVM-MSF), and a self-organizing map (SOM) were proposed. The task of this model was divided into four parts: hydrodynamic simulation, point forecasting, inundation database clustering, and spatial expansion. First, the SOBEK model was used in simulating inundation hydrodynamics to construct the flooding maps database. Second, the SVM-MSF yields water level (inundation volume) forecasted with a 1 to 72 h lead time. Third, the SOM clustered the previous flooding maps database into several groups representing different flooding characteristics. Finally, a spatial expansion module produced inundation maps based on forecasting information from forecasting flood volume and flood causative factors. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting model, we presented an application to the Yilan River basin in Taiwan. Our forecasting results indicated that the proposed model yields accurate flood inundation maps (less than 1 cm error) for a 1 h lead time. For long-term forecasting (46 h to 72 h ahead), the model controlled the error of the forecast results within 7 cm. In the testing events, the model forecasted an average of 83% of the flooding area in the long term. This flood inundation forecasting model is expected to be useful in providing early flood warning information for disaster emergency response.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images can be used to monitor water bodies and detect floods over large areas. To address the problem of low identification accuracy in different time phases and different scales of water area, a water surface mapping method based on Attention-UNet3+ with SAR images is proposed in this paper. In the model, full-scale skip connections are introduced for combining feature maps from different scales and improving the accuracy of narrow water identification; the spatial attention module is used to obtain the importance of each connected feature, which can reduce the number of false alarms caused by speckle noise and water shadows in SAR data; the deep supervision module is used to learn hierarchical representative features from comprehensive aggregated feature maps to provide the periodic output capability of the model and meet the needs of rapid and large-scale water identification. The effectiveness of Attention-UNet3+ is verified by experiments in the Poyang Lake region with Sentinel-1 SAR images. The results show that the proposed Attention-UNet3+ outperforms the conventional threshold segmentation and deep learning models such as UNet, Deepvlabv3+, and SegNet, with an average IOU/Kappa value of 0.9502/0.9698. Multitemporal Sentinel-1 images in 2021 covering Poyang Lake are used for time series water surface mapping with the proposed method, and it is found that the detected water area of Poyang Lake has a good correlation with the corresponding water level values at observation stations. The Pearson coefficients are about 0.96. The above results indicate that the proposed method achieves good water surface mapping performance.

One of the critical factors to handle such hazardous events is monitoring the affected areas and changes in flood patterns. Flood management is a very complex issue, largely owing to the growing population and investments in flood-affected regions. Satellite images especially Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are very useful and effective because SAR images are acquired day and night in all types of weather conditions. This research analyzes a combination of machine learning algorithms implemented on Sentinel-1A (SAR) data using supervised classification techniques to monitor the flooded areas in the North Indian region. Random Forest (RF) and the K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classification is applied to classify the different land covers such as water bodies, land, vegetation, and bare soil land covers. The outcomes of the presented work depict that the SAR data provides efficient information that helps in monitoring the flooded extents and the analysis shows that Sentinel-1 images are quite effective to detect changes in flood patterns in urban, vegetation, and regular water areas of the selected regions. The distribution of flooded areas was 16.6% and 16.8% in the respective region which is consistent with the resultant images of the proposed approach using RF and KNN classifiers. The obtained results indicate that both classifiers used in the work generate higher classification accuracy. These classifiers define the potential of multi-polarimetric SAR data in the classification of flood-affected areas. For a thorough evaluation and comparison, the RF and KNN are utilized as benchmarked classifiers. The classification accuracies based on the investigated results from the three SAR images can be improved by incorporating spatial and polarimetric features. In the future, the deep-learning classification techniques using ensemble strategies are expected to achieve an increased accuracy level with an overall classification strategy of urban and vegetation mapping.

In this study, a hybrid ML model was developed for flood map generation with multiple lead times based on the combination of the support vector regression (SVR) method and Heun's scheme for numerical correction, in which the hydraulic simulation results are used for model training while rainfall and flood sensor data are used as input variables (namely, the SVR-RFN model). To evaluate the performance of the hybrid model, two additional SVR models were developed and used as references for comparisonâthe first one used rainfall as input variables without sensor data (namely, the SVR-R model), and the second one added flood sensor data as input variables without numerical correction (namely, the SVR-RF model). The three models are tested and compared with a hydraulic model for a historical event in Sanyei River Basin, Taiwan. Using the hydraulic model as the benchmark, the hybrid model performed the best by reducing 63% of flood depth error and had the least deterioration of accuracy as lead time increased. The SVR-RF model performed the second by reducing the flood depth errors by 46% whereas the hydraulic model was more accurate than the SVR-R model. In a comparison of flood extents, the hydraulic model showed overestimation, the SVR-R model showed significant underestimation, whereas the two models with sensor data had balanced predictions. The flood maps generated by the hybrid model were applied for dike safety evaluation and showed a good capability in forecasting the risk of dike breach.

Nigeria Southeastern region has been devastated by flood from extreme weather conditions. Flood mitigation involves accurate forecasting, precise prediction, evaluation, and intervention strategy. This study aims at using machine learning solutions to investigate and predict flood susceptibility from selected rivers in the south-eastern region of Nigeria.

The remote sensing datasets from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) version 2 &amp; 3 platforms from five selected rivers were processed. With the data output of the hydrology, streamline flows, and exposed geology, the ARIMA model was built and used to forecast the flood. The result shows that the flooding pattern would increase by 15-150% within 2020-2024.

Working from the perspective of network public opinion is an effective way to understand flood disasters. However, the existing research tends to focus on a single perspective, such as the characteristics of the text, algorithm optimization, or spatial location recognition, while scholars have paid much less attention to the impact of social-psychological differences in space on network public opinion. This research is based on the following hypothesis: When public opinions break out, the differences of network public opinions in geography will form spatially different centers of geographical public opinions in flood disasters (CGeoPOFDs). These centers represent the cities that receive the most attention from network public opinion. Based on this hypothesis, this study proposes a new way of identifying and analyzing CGeoPOFDs. First, two optimization strategies were applied to enhance a naÃ¯ve Bayes network: syntactic parsing, which was used to optimize the selection of feature word vectors, and ensemble learning, which enabled multi-classifier fusion optimization. Social media data were classified through the improved algorithm, and then, various methods (hotspot analysis, geographic mapping, and sentiment analysis) were used to identify CGeoPOFDs. Finally, analysis was performed in terms of spatiotemporal, virtual, and real dimensions. In addition, microblog social data and real disaster data were used to arrive at empirical results. According to the study findings, the identified CGeoPOFDs offered traditional characteristics of network public opinion while also featuring unique spatiotemporal characteristics. Over time, CGeoPOFDs demonstrated spatial aggregation and bias diffusion and an overall positive emotional tendency.

Settlements in flood hazard zones increase flood risk due to a lack of information and awareness. The present study proposed a machine learning-based framework to identify such flood risk zones for the lower Narmada basin in India. Flood hazard factors like elevation and slope of the terrain, distance from main river network, drainage density, annual average rainfall of the area, and land-use land-cover (LULC) characteristics, as well as flood vulnerability factors like population density, agricultural production, and roadâriver intersections, were used as predictors in the random forest algorithm to predict the flood depth in the region. Initially, the flood depth obtained from the hydrodynamic model was used as a predict and to train the model and determine the weightage of each predictor. The RandomizedSeachCV technique was used to optimize hyperparameters of the random forest algorithm. The obtained results from variable importance of random forest show that the elevation of the terrain, LULC characteristics, distance from the main river network, and rainfall are the major contributors to cause flood risk in the area. Furthermore, the possibility of using the IoT-based sensor to develop the real-time flood risk mapping framework is described. The developed flood risk map can assist policymakers, stakeholders, and citizens in developing guidelines, taking preventive measures, and avoid unnecessary settlements in flood risk zones.

Each hybrid model consists of a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm coupled with one of the following metaheuristic optimization procedures: grey wolf optimization (GWO), differential evolution, and the imperialist competitive algorithm. Sentinel-1 acquired SAR images before and during flooding between 20 March and 26 May of 2019. The goodness-of-fit level and predictive capability of each model were scrutinized using overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. The SVM-GWO approach yielded the highest accuracy with overall accuracies of 96.07% and 93.39% in the training and validation steps, respectively. Furthermore, this hybrid model provided the most accurate classification of water-inundation class based on producer accuracy (96.67%) and user accuracy (95.05%).

The method consisted of evaluating the effectiveness of the application and combination of (a) a super-resolution algorithm to improve image resolution, (b) a set of seven spectral indices for highlighting water-covered areas, such as AWE indices, and (c) two methods for flood mapping, including a machine learning method based on unsupervised classification (EM cluster) and 14 thresholding methods for automatic determination. The processes were evaluated in the CarriÃ³n River, Palencia, Spain. It was determined that the approach with the best results in flood mapping was the one that combined AWE spectral indices with methods such as Huang and Wang, Li and Tam, Otsu, moment preservation, and EM cluster classification, showing global accuracy and Kappa coefficient values higher than 0.88 and 0.75, respectively, when applying the quantitative accuracy index.

Development of higher resolution SAR flood mapping that accurately identifies flood features at all scales can be incorporated into operational flood forecasting tools, improving response and resilience to large flood events. Here, we present a comparison of several methods for characterizing flood inundation using a combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data and machine learning methods. We implement two applications with SAR GRD data, an amplitude thresholding technique applied, for the first time, to Sentinel-1A/B SAR data, and a machine learning technique, DeepLabv3+. We also apply DeepLabv3+ to a false color RGB characterization of dual polarization SAR data. Analyses at 10 m pixel spacing are performed for the major flood event associated with Hurricane Harvey and associated inundation in Houston, TX in August of 2017. We compare these results with high-resolution aerial optical images over this time period, acquired by the NOAA Remote Sensing Division. We compare the results with NDWI produced from Sentinel-2 images, also at 10 m pixel spacing, and statistical testing suggests that the amplitude thresholding technique is the most effective, although the machine learning analysis is successful at reproducing the inundation shape and extent. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of flood inundation mapping at unprecedented resolutions and its potential for use in operational emergency hazard response to large flood events.

In this research, we performed to predict the low and high classes of K-factor in the northwest of Iran. Based on this, soil sampling was performed at 64 points using the grid sampling method with 1Â km spacing. To calculate the K-factor, the distribution of particle size and organic carbon (OC) were determined. In addition, 21 terrain attributes were calculated by Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to add value to the soil data. Then, K-factor was modeled using Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. In the next step, a non-linear Multiple Logistic Regression (NMLR) was used to obtain low and high classes of K-factor. The results showed that the performance of RF is superior to ANN with a high coefficient of determination [R2 = 0.85] and good accuracy [RMSE = 0.003 (Mg ha h/ha MJ mm)]. Therefore, the RF was employed for predicting the K-factor spatial distribution. Finally, using the NMLR model, the study area was divided into low and high classes of K-factor with good correlation [R2 Cox and Snell = 0.78, R2 Nagelkerke = 0.65]. The areas of these two classes were 60.4% for low class and 39.6% for the high class of K-factor. Based on these results, it was concluded that the resultant map of low and high classes of K-factor could be used by farmers and managers for managing soil water erosion risks in the study area.

The problem is important in many spatial and spatiotemporal applications such as flood extent mapping in hydrology. The problem is uniquely challenging for several reasons: first, the size of earth imagery on a terrain surface is often much larger than the input of popular deep convolutional neural networks; second, there exists topological structure dependency between pixel classes on the surface, and such dependency can follow an unknown and non-linear distribution; third, there are often limited training labels. Existing methods for earth imagery segmentation often divide the imagery into patches and consider the elevation as an additional feature channel. These methods do not fully incorporate the spatial topological structural constraint within and across surface patches and thus often show poor results, especially when training labels are limited. Existing methods on semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for earth imagery often focus on learning representation without explicitly incorporating surface topology. In contrast, we propose a novel framework that explicitly models the topological skeleton of a terrain surface with a contour tree from computational topology, which is guided by the physical constraint (e.g., water flow direction on terrains). Our framework consists of two neural networks: a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn spatial contextual features on a 2D image grid, and a graph neural network (GNN) to learn the statistical distribution of physics-guided spatial topological dependency on the contour tree. The two models are co-trained via variational EM. Evaluations on the real-world flood mapping datasets show that the proposed models outperform baseline methods in classification accuracy, especially when training labels are limited.

However, SRCs use Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived reach averaged hydraulic properties and assume one dimensional steady state flow condition with normal depth. These implicit model assumptions may introduce errors in flood stage and extent estimates using the HAND-SRC approach. This study investigates the reliability of SRC across continental United States (CONUS) by comparing them to the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) gauge rating curves. Results from this comparison show that the implicit model assumptions used in the SRC-HAND approach add significant error in the SRC derivation. The accuracy of the SRC is found to be related to the stream characteristics, including the bathymetry area, slope of the main channel two-year flow and drainage area. Results also show that SRCs in coastal areas, characterized by low slopes and large drainage areas, have higher error and tend to overpredict the stage height in comparison to the USGS rating curves; whereas they tend to underpredict stage height in the mountainous regions. The SRCs are most reliable for the midwestern plains of Ohio, Mid Atlantic, Tennessee and Upper Mississippi regions, and least reliable (higher error) for the Rocky Mountains. Further, the study finds that Deep Neural Network models can be effectively used to judge the performance of SRC for ungauged river reaches.

One of the technologies available for disaster mitigation and prevention is satellites providing image data on previously flooded areas. In most cases, floods occur in conjunction with heavy rain. Thus, from a satelliteâs optical sensor, the flood area is mostly covered with clouds which indicates ineffective observation. One solution to this problem is to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors by observing backscatter differences before and after flood events. This research proposes mapping the flood-prone areas using machine learning to classify the areas using the 3D CNN method. The method was applied on a combination of co-polarized and cross-polarized SAR multi-temporal image datasets covering Jakarta City and the coastal area of Bekasi Regency.

However, massive shadows cast by buildings and trees over dense built-up urban areas can cause a significant underestimation of flood outcomes, and few studies for flood monitoring explore this in current state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, recent deep learning (DL) algorithms have reported superior performance in flood mapping over conventional machine learning methods. Nevertheless, acquiring a large amount of training data remains challenging in the DL paradigm. In this study, to exploit the potential of the DL algorithm in detecting all visible (including shadowed and non-shadowed) floodwater with limited training samples from aerial imagery, we designed a modified fully convolutional network and combined it with a deep semi-supervised learning framework integrating consistency regularization and RandMix strategy into the floodwater detection workflow. Besides, the test-time augmentation technique was leveraged to improve the model performance in the evaluation phase. Extensive experiments on the 2013 Calgary flood demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on extracting visible floodwater in urban areas with dense shadows. Notably, our method could accurately detect more floodwater with a largely reduced number of labeled training samples, which is a considerable enhancement in the applicability and availability of DL algorithms for flood monitoring in densely shadowed urban areas.

Major advancements have been made in the collaborative mapping of buildings with platforms like OpenStreetMap, however, many parts of the world still lack this information or the information is outdated. We created a semi-automated workflow for the development of elements-at-risk (EaR) databases of buildings by detecting building footprints using deep learning and characterising the footprints with building occupancy information using building morphological metrics and open-source auxiliary data. The deep learning model was used to detect building EaR footprints in a city in Kerala (India) with an F1 score of over 76%. The footprints were classified into 13 building occupancy types along with information such as average number of floors, total floor space area, building density, and percentage of built-up area. We analysed the transferability of the approach to a different city in Kerala and obtained an almost similar F1 score of 74%.

However, few studies have investigated such effects of mineral type and its surface wettability on rock properties in the literature. To unravel the dependence of hydrodynamics on wettability and minerals distribution, we designed a new experimental procedure that combined the multiphase flow experiments with a CT scan and QEMSCAN to obtain 3D digital models with multiple minerals and fluids. With the aid of QEMSCAN, six mineral components and two fluids in sandstones were segmented from the CT data based on the histogram threshold and watershed methods. Then, a mineral surface analysis algorithm was proposed to extract the mineral surface and classify its mineral categories. The in situ contact angle and pore occupancy were calculated to reveal the wettability variation of mineral surface and distribution characteristics of fluids. According to the shape features of the oil phase, the self-organizing map (SOM) method, one of the machine learning methods, was used to classify the residual oil into five types, namely, network, cluster, film, isolated, and droplet oil. The results indicate that each mineralâs contribution to the mineral surface is not proportional to its relative content. Feldspar, quartz, and clay are the main minerals in the studied sandstones and play a controlling role in the wettability variation. Different wettability samples show various characteristics of pore occupancy. The water flooding front of the weakly water-wet to intermediate-wet sample is uniform, and oil is effectively displaced in all pores with a long oil production period. The water-wet sample demonstrates severe fingering, with a high pore occupancy change rate in large pores and a short oil production period. The residual oil patterns gradually evolve from networks to clusters, isolated, and films due to the effects of snap-off and wettability inversion. This paper reveals the effects of wettability of mineral surface on the distribution characteristics and formation mechanisms of residual oil, which offers us an in-deep understanding of the impacts of wettability and minerals on multiphase flow and helps us make good schemes to improve oil recovery Â© 2022 Yimin Zhang et al.

Open remote sensing resources such as the data provided by the Copernicus ecosystem enable to carry out this activity, which benefits from frequent revisit times on a global scale. In the last decades, satellite imagery has been successfully applied to flood delineation problems, especially considering Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals. However, current remote mapping services rely on time-consuming manual or semi-automated approaches, requiring the intervention of domain experts. The implementation of accurate and scalable automated pipelines is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets. To address these issues, we propose MMFlood, a multimodal remote sensing dataset purposely designed for flood delineation. The dataset contains 1,748 Sentinel-1 acquisitions, comprising 95 flood events distributed across 42 countries. Along with satellite imagery, the dataset includes the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), hydrography maps, and flood delineation maps provided by Copernicus EMS, which is considered as ground truth. To provide baseline performances on the MMFlood test set, we conduct a number of experiments of the flood delineation task using state-of-art deep learning models, and we evaluate the performance gains of entropy-based sampling and multi-encoder architectures, which are respectively used to tackle two of the main challenges posed by MMFlood, namely the class unbalance and the multimodal setting. Lastly, we provide a future outlook on how to further improve the performance of the flood delineation task. Dataset and code can be found at https://github.com/edornd/mmflood.

Open areas affected by flooding have low backscatter due to the specular reflection of calm water surfaces. Floodwater within built-up areas leads to double-bounce effects, the complexity of which depends on the configuration of floodwater concerning the facades of the surrounding buildings. Hence, it has been shown that the analysis of interferometric SAR coherence reduces the underdetection of floods in urbanized areas. Moreover, the high potential of deep convolutional neural networks for advancing SAR-based flood mapping is widely acknowledged. Therefore, we introduce an urban-aware U-Net model using dual-polarization Sentinel-1 multitemporal intensity and coherence data to map the extent of flooding in urban environments. It uses a priori information (i.e., an SAR-derived probabilistic urban mask) in the proposed urban-aware module, consisting of channel-wise attention and urban-aware normalization submodules to calibrate features and improve the final predictions. In this study, Sentinel-1 single-look complex data acquired over four study sites from three continents have been considered. The qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis have been carried out using six urban flood cases. A comparison with previous methods reveals a significant enhancement in the accuracy of urban flood mapping: the F1 score of flooded urban increased from 0.3 to 0.6 with few false alarms in urban area using our method.

One such climatic extreme, Cyclone Idai (March 2019), caused significant havoc across southeastern Africa, including Mozambique, Malawi, and eastern Zimbabwe, by triggering thousands of landslides and widespread concurrent flooding, both of which resulted in substantial loss of life. The study was conducted in the Chimanimani District of eastern Zimbabwe to understand the impact of Cyclone Idai on landslideÂ initiation, quantify the volume of mobilized hillslope material during the event, and compare the event-triggered material releaseÂ against theÂ annual erosional yield across the study area using machine learning and remote sensing techniques. We evaluated satellite imagery of various resolutions, namely, PlanetScope (3m/px), RapidEye (5m/px), and Sentinel-2 (10m/px) and three machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to identify landslides and compared the efficacy of the models. A total of nine predictor variables derived from the satellite imagery and aÂ 30-m ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model were employed to identify landslides and differentiate them from concurrent hydrological flooding. The models classified the study area into three classes: (i) landslides, (ii) flooding, and (iii) unaffected area. The RF model using PlanetScope satellite data attained the highest prediction accuracy of 97.88%, whereas the accuracy of other machine learningÂ model-satellite data combinations ranged between 94.58 and 97.27%. Subsequently, landslide size thresholds were applied on the initially mapped landslides to eliminate noise and uncertainty from the data before estimating the final Cyclone Idai event-triggered landslide volume. A probability density function, which corresponds to a logarithmic plot of non-cumulative landslide frequency against the mapped landslide area, was employed to calculate landslide size thresholds using divergence and rollover point cutoff values. Finally, a landslide area-to-volume power-law scaling relationship was exploited to derive landslide volumes in the study area that ranged between 6.8 Ã 10 6 to 14.7 Ã 10 6 m3Â and 9.0 Ã 10 6 to 19.6 Ã 10 6 m3 for divergence and rollover point thresholds, respectively, across the different combinations of machine learning models and satellite sensors.

Considering that the construction of geological models with traditional numerical simulation software is complicated, the computational efficiency of the simulation calculation is often low, and the numerical simulation tools need to be repeated iteratively in the process of model optimization, machine learning methods have been used for fast reservoir simulation. However, traditional artificial neural network (ANN) has large degrees of freedom, slow convergence speed, and complex network model. This paper aims to predict the production performance of water flooding reservoirs based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DC-GAN) model, and establish a dynamic mapping relationship between well location deployment and output oil saturation. The network structure is based on an improved U-Net framework. Through a deep convolutional network and deconvolution network, the features of input well deployment images are extracted, and the stability of the adversarial model is strengthened. The training speed and accuracy of the proxy model are improved, and the oil saturation of water flooding reservoirs is dynamically predicted. The results show that the trained DC-GAN has significant advantages in predicting oil saturation by the well-location employment map. The cosine similarity between the oil saturation map given by the trained DC-GAN and the oil saturation map generated by the numerical simulator is compared. In above, DC-GAN is an effective method to conduct a proxy model to quickly predict the production performance of water flooding reservoirs. Â© 2022, Tech Science Press.

Given that glacial lakes have little area compared with background objects, extracting glacial lakes high precisely is still challenging. Recently, U-Net, a deep learning (DL) method, has shown great potential in glacial lake extraction, due to its elaborate encoder-decoder structure and powerful skip connections. However, the skip connections transmit a lot of information irrelevant to glacial lakes from the low-level appearance features to the high-level semantic features, leading to inefficient utilization of the low-level features. In this letter, we propose a normalized difference water index (NDWI) attention U-Net (NAU-Net) for pixel-wise glacial lake segmentation, which utilizes NDWI as a spatial attention to highlight the signals of water regions in low-level feature maps, thereby making the network pay more attention to glacial lakes. Compared with the classical networks and the state-of-the-art non-DL methods, our NAU-Net shows better performance on glacial lake extraction.

However, satellite revisit periods and extreme weather limit the use of high spatial resolution images. As a result, this research provides a method for combining Landsat and MODIS pictures to produce high spatiotemporal imagery for flood disaster monitoring. Using the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), the spatial and temporal reflectance unmixing model (STRUM), and three prominent algorithms of flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF), Landsat fusion images are created by fusing MODIS and Landsat images. Then, to extract flood information, utilize a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the fusion images. Assess the accuracy of your work. Experimental results suggest that the three spatio-temporal fusion algorithms may be used to effectively monitor floods, with FSDAFâs fusion results outperforming STARFM and STRUM in both study areas. The overall flood classification accuracy of the three STARFM, STRUM, and FSDAF algorithms in the Gwydir research region is 0.89, 0.90, and 0.91, respectively, with Kappa coefficients of 0.63, 0.64, and 0.67.

However, errors in the mapping result are expected since not all land-cover changes are flood-induced, and those changes are sensitive to SAR data, such as crop growth or harvest over agricultural lands, clearance of forested areas, and/or modifications on the urban landscape. This study, therefore, incorporated historical SAR images to boost the detection of flood-induced changes during extreme weather events, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. Additionally, to incorporate the spatial signatures for the change detection, we applied a deep learning-based spatiotemporal simulation framework, Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), for simulating a synthetic image using Sentinel One intensity time series. This synthetic image will be prepared in advance of flood events, and then it can be used to detect flood areas using change detection when the post-image is available. Practically, significant divergence between the synthetic image and post-image is expected over inundated zones, which can be mapped by applying thresholds to the Delta image (synthetic image minus post-image). We trained and tested our model on three events from Australia, Brazil, and Mozambique. The generated Flood Proxy Maps were compared against reference data derived from Sentinel Two and Planet Labs optical data. To corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we also generated Delta products for two baseline models (closest post-image minus pre-image and historical mean minus post-image) and two LSTM architectures: normal LSTM and ConvLSTM. Results show that thresholding of ConvLSTM Delta yielded the highest Cohenâs Kappa coefficients in all study cases: 0.92 for Australia, 0.78 for Mozambique, and 0.68 for Brazil. Lower Kappa values obtained in the Mozambique case can be subject to the topographic effect on SAR imagery. These results still confirm the benefits in terms of classification accuracy that convolutional operations provide in time series analysis of satellite data employing spatially correlated information in a deep learning framework.

In recent years, meteorological and hydrological disasters, such as flood storms and other disasters, have been a significant threat to immovable cultural relics due to global climate change, torrential weather, and other extreme weather. Thus, extensive mapping and dynamic monitoring of water bodies timely are essential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantages of all-day, all-weather, and large-scale periodic earth observation and plays a key role in the application of large-scale water body monitoring.In this paper, a framework for monitoring inundation and risk of immovable cultural heritage based on residual U-Net is proposed by using time series SAR images. First, on the basis of the bimodal threshold segmentation method and combined with expert knowledge, water sample generation was carried out to improve the efficiency of the sample production. Second, the U-shaped convolutional network was established by introducing the residual module, which combined the characteristics of the residual structure and U-Net to alleviate the gradient dispersion and disappearance during the value updating. By accumulating and jumping links between convolutional layers, more feature information of objects is retained to achieve rapid and high-precision semantic segmentation of water bodies. Finally, by superimposing the water extraction results with the area of immovable cultural relics, the waterlogging status of immovable cultural relics can be monitored.Poyang Lake and the relic of Changyi Beidang in Nanchang were selected for the experiments. A total of 21 Sentinel-1 images covering Poyang Lake at different dates were obtained for water body extraction. The results were analyzed and evaluated by combining corresponding Sentinel-2 optical images. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the proposed method in the Poyang Lake experimental area is greater than 95%, and the proposed method outperforms Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) and U-Net methods.Spatial superposition analysis was conducted combining the site of relic of Changyi with the monitoring results of water bodies from SAR images in long-term series.

The management of riparian vegetation is often neglected, though woody species increase the vegetation roughness of floodplains and increase flood levels. The aims are (1) to determine the branch density of various riparian vegetation types in the flood conveyance zone up to the level of artificial levees (up to 5 m), and (2) to assess the spatial distribution of densely vegetated patches. Applying a decision tree and machine learning, six vegetation types were identified with an accuracy of 83%. The vegetation density was determined within each type by applying the normalized relative point density (NRD) method. Besides, vegetation density was calculated in each submerged vegetation zone (1â2 m, 2â3 m, etc.). Thus, the obstacles for floods with various frequencies were mapped. In the study area, young poplar plantations offer the most favorable flood conveyance conditions, whereas invasive Amorpha thickets and the dense stands of native willow forests provide the worst conditions for flood conveyance. Dense and very dense vegetation patches are common in all submerged vegetation zones; thus, vegetation could heavily influence floods. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, providing methods with the ability to accurately assess these damages in the shortest possible time is a necessity of crisis management. In this regard, various methods for classifying remote sensing images have been developed, which always face challenges in differentiating land uses. Another challenge in flood crisis management is the lack of access to satellite imagery with high temporal resolution while maintaining spatial resolution. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the damage caused by the flood crisis in Khuzestan province following the flood of 1398, which is based on integration of images of Sentinel 2 and MODIS to produce a time series with relatively good spatial and temporal resolution. In order to prepare maps, a patch-based hierarchical convolutional neural network has been designed, which solves the challenge of extracting deep features due to the relatively weak structure of images with a resolution of more than 10 meters. Finally, the area of damage to urban land cover and various agricultural lands has been estimated consecutively during the flood period. The results indicated that the proposed approach was properly faced with the challenge of speed and accuracy in preparing a flood destruction map, implementing on images at different times of the flood shows the generality.

While large-scale climate patterns such as teleconnections and climate change become important at this scale, it remains a challenge to represent the local hydrological cycle over various watersheds in a manner that is physically consistent with climate. As a result, global models tend to suffer from a lack of available scenarios and flexibility that are key for planners, relief organizations, regulators, and the financial services industry to analyze the socioeconomic, demographic, and climatic factors affecting exposure. Here we introduce a data-driven, global, fast, flexible, and climate-consistent flood risk modeling framework for applications that do not necessarily require high-resolution flood mapping. We use statistical and machine learning methods to examine the relationship between historical flood occurrence and impact from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (1985â2017), and climatic, watershed, and socioeconomic factors for 4,734 HydroSHEDS watersheds globally. Using bias-corrected output from the NCAR CESM Large Ensemble (1980â2020), and the fitted statistical relationships, we simulate 1 million years of events worldwide along with the population displaced in each event. We discuss potential applications of the model and present global flood hazard and risk maps.

Hyperspectral imaging is widely utilized in identifying and classifying objects on the ground surface for various agriculture application uses such as crop mapping, flood management, identifying crops damaged due to flood/drought, etc. Hyperspectral imaging-based crop classification is a very challenging task because of spectral dimensions and poor spatial feature representation. Designing efficient feature extraction and dimension reduction techniques can address high dimensionality problems. Nonetheless, achieving good classification accuracies with minimal computation overhead is a challenging task in Hyperspectral imaging-based crop classification. In meeting research challenges, this work presents Hyperspectral imaging-based crop classification using soft-margin decision boundary optimization (SMDBO) based Support Vector Machine (SVM) along with Image Fusion-Recursive Filter (IFRF) and Inherent Feature Extraction (IFE). In this work, IFRF is used for reducing spectral features with meaningful representation. Then, IFE is used for differentiating physical properties and shading elements of different objects spatially. Both spectral and spatial features extracted are trained using SMDBO-SVM for performing hyperspectral object classification. Using SMDBO-SVM for Hyperspectral object classification aid in addressing class imbalance issues; thus, the proposed IFE-SMDBO-SVM model achieves better accuracies and with minimal misclassification in comparison with state-of-art statistical and Deep Learning (DL) based Hyperspectral object classification model using standard dataset Indian Pines and Pavia University.

One approach gaining popularity recently is the development of emulation models using data driven methods, such as artificial neural networks. These emulation models are often developed to model flood depth for each grid cell in the modelling domain in order to maintain accurate spatial representation of the flood inundation surface. This leads to redundancy in modelling, as well as difficulties in achieving good model performance across floodplains where there are limited data available. In this paper, a spatial reduction and reconstruction (SRR) method is developed to (1) identify representative locations within the model domain where water levels can be used to represent flood inundation surface using deep learning models; and (2) reconstruct the flood inundation surface based on water levels simulated at these representative locations. The SRR method is part of the SRR-Deep-Learning framework for flood inundation modelling and therefore, it needs to be used together with data driven models. The SRR method is programmed using the Python programming language and is freely available from https://github.com/yuerongz/SRR-method. â¢ The SRR method identifies locations which are representative of flood inundation behavior in surrounding areas. â¢ The representative locations selected following the SRR method have sufficient flood data for developing emulation models. â¢ Flood inundation surfaces can be reconstructed using the SRR method with a detection rate of above 99%.

The adverse impact of floods is greater on vulnerable populations that disproportionately inhabit flood-prone areas. This paper reports a comprehensive study on flood vulnerability of flood prone areas in residential areas of the Tajan watershed, Iran in two periods before 2006 and after 2006. Flood prone area were determined by the random forest (RF) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine learning methods. To reduce time and cost, the vulnerability was assessed only in areas with very high flood hazard using 4 main criteria (social, policy, economic, infrastructure), 40 items, and 210 questionnaires across 40 villages. Independent t-test, Kruskal-Wallis, and paired t-test were used for statistical analysis of questionnaire data. The results of machine learning models (MLMs) showed that the RF model with AUC = 0.92% is more accurate in determining flood prone areas. The results of paired t-test showed that the three criteria of social (mean P1 = 2.97 and P2 = 3.35), infrastructure (mean P1 = 2.88 and P2 = 3.25), and policy (mean P1 = 3.02 and P2 = 3.50) had significant changes in both periods.

The results of the t-test also showed a decrease in vulnerability in the second period (before 2006) compared to the first period (after 2006), so the number of sub-watersheds in the very high vulnerability class was more in the first period than in the second period.

However, the unavailability of multi-domain and multi-dimensional input data and expensive computational resources limit its application in resource-constrained regions. The fifth and sixth IPCC assessment reports recommend including vulnerability and exposure components along with hazards for capturing risk on human-environment systems from natural and anthropogenic sources. In this context, the present study showcases a novel flood risk mapping approach that considers a combination of geomorphic flood descriptor (GFD)-based flood susceptibility and often neglected socio-economic vulnerability components. Three popular Machine Learning (ML) models, namely Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient-boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), are evaluated for their abilities to combine digital terrain model-derived GFDs for quantifying flood susceptibility in a flood-prone district, Jagatsinghpur, located in the lower Mahanadi River basin, India. The area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) along with Cohen's kappa are used to identify the best ML model. It is observed that the RF model performs better compared to the other two models on both training and testing datasets, with AUC score of 0.88 on each. The socio-economic vulnerability assessment follows an indicator-based approach by employing the Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR) model of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), an efficient non-parametric ranking method. It combines the district's relevant socio-economic sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators. The flood risk classes at the most refined administrative scale, i.e., village level, are determined with the Jenks natural breaks algorithm using flood susceptibility and socio-economic vulnerability scores estimated by the RF and CCR-DEA models, respectively. It was observed that >40 % of the villages spread over Jagatsinghpur face high and very high flood risk. The proposed novel framework is generic and can be used to derive a wide variety of flood susceptibility, vulnerability, and subsequently risk maps under a data-constrained scenario. Furthermore, since this approach is relatively data and computationally parsimonious, it can be easily implemented over large regions. The exhaustive flood maps will facilitate effective flood control and floodplain planning.

Machine learning is an optional assessment method because of its high objectivity and computational efficiency, but how to get enough and accurate information of historical flood locations to train the machine learning models has been a key problem. In recent years, news media data from both news websites and social media accounts has emerged as a promising source for natural science studies. However, the application of news media data in urban flood susceptibility assessment is still inadequate. This study proposed an approach to fill this gap. Firstly, flood locations were extracted from news media data based on a named entity recognition (NER) model. Then, a frequency or distance-based data quality control method was employed to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations. Finally, flood conditioning factors with information of historical flood locations were input into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for flood susceptibility assessment. We took the central city of Dalian, China as a case study. The T-test results show that there was no significant difference between the distributions of most flood conditioning factors at the flood locations from the news media data and the official planning report. In the obtained flood susceptibility map, the high flood susceptibility areas got a recall of 90% compared with the high flood hazard areas in the planning report. Performing data quality control in the frequency-based method can improve the precision of the flood susceptibility map by up to 5%, while the distance-based method is ineffective.

Three models were used in this study: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). Seventeen influencing factors are used to map multi-hazards using inventory data. The effectiveness and significance of the factors were determined for both landslides and floods. Model results were compared using area under the curve (AUC), overall hazard accuracy, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and kappa index. The results show that RF has the best performance in predicting landslides with a high AUC of 94.9%, while SVM, LR, and RF have high prediction for floods (AUC of 92.7%, 98%, and 98.7%, respectively).

However, it is usually not known which areas and cities are particularly vulnerable to flooding caused by heavy rain. To enable regional-scale susceptibility assessment, we developed a novel methodology based on tree-based classifiers that considers both spatially distributed and catchment-related influencing factors. The performance of the developed methodology was evaluated using the region of Bavaria (Germany). For the case study area (70,500 km2), we trained a Random Forest (RF), a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and a CatBoost model (CB) using 1,864 flood and non-flood locations and 11 spatially distributed and six catchment-related influencing factors. Regarding performance metrics, all three models performed equally well (CB: AUC = 0.819, RF: AUC = 0.816, GBDT: AUC = 0.813), with the CatBoost model performing best. When modeling large areas, it proved critical to account for low sample density by ensuring (i) a homogeneous spatial coverage of the study area and (ii) the representation of the major landscapes in the training and test set. In addition, we propose an overall susceptibility score for cities based on the susceptibility map generated, which can be used to prioritize cities for detailed investigations. Those responsible for spatial planning and flood risk management can apply the proposed methodology to obtain a pluvial and flash flood susceptibility assessment for large territories.

Predicting and mapping pluvial flood-prone areas is becoming a crucial step in flood mitigation and early warnings, as well as climate change adaptation strategies, to be incorporate in urban planning. Most commonly applied machine learning (ML) procedures for pluvial flood risk assessment, neglect to account for spatio-temporal constraints, leading to overoptimistic models that underestimate the prediction error. In this paper, we propose a novel ML-based methodology for pluvial flood risk prediction in the Metropolitan City of Venice which, introducing a features selection process and spatio-temporal cross-validation, permits to reduce overfitting of the resulting ML models. Spatio-temporal characteristics of floods are derived from a dataset of 60 historical events occurred in the area between 1995 and 2020. Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forest (RF) models are applied to identify and prioritize sub-areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood risk, considering the daily precipitation amount and 12 different triggering factors. The models were validated using Random Cross-Validation (R-CV) and Leave Location and Time Out cross-validation (LLTO-CV), that split data in training and validation set considering both time and space. In addition, a forward features selection procedure was applied to identify the features, among the triggering factors, that better face spatio-temporal overfitting in pluvial flood prediction based on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score. Results suggest that Logistic Regression and LLTO-CV represent the most reliable model to predict pluvial flood events in new spatio-temporal conditions, while, among the triggering factors, distance to river and distance to road resulted the prominent ones.

The framework of the study comprises two major steps: prediction of geo-hydrological hazard-prone locations (Step-1: hazard/non-hazard), and classification of geo-hydrological hazards by identifying the locations of floods and landslides separately (Step-2: floods/landslides). We used 1326 historically experienced hazard locations (i.e., 726 for floods and 690 for landslides) in the Kentucky River basin, United States, along with the 13 hazard conditioning factors. Extremely randomized trees (ERT) coupled with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) was adopted to provide an effective classification scheme. Based on the predictions of the ERT-PSO in the first step, correctly classified hazard instances were used in the second step of the prediction task to further deepen the machine learning application. The results revealed a strong agreement between the predicted and observed hazard locations with an AUROC of 0.8032 and 0.8845 for geo-hydrological hazard (Step-1) and flood/landslide classifications (Step-2), respectively. The proposed hybrid prediction framework introduced considerably accurate performance as 73.78% and 72.91% of the hazard and non-hazard classes were correctly identified at Step-1, respectively, while at Step-2, 72.31% of the flooding points and 84.85% of the landslide points were ascertained accurately. Overall findings emerged from Step-1 illustrated that nearly 10% of the entire basin is susceptible to geo-hydrological hazards with very high probability, whereas very low susceptible areas cover only 20% of the basin. A model-agnostic game-theory based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was employed to anatomize the contribution of hazard conditioning factors on the incident outcome predictions aiding to increase the interpretability of the adopted methodology. The holistic approach adopted in the present research has significant potential in providing insights into the practical and theoretical grounds of the literature.

This goal was pursued in four research phases. The thirteen flood predictors were evaluated using information gain ratio (IGR), and finally reduced to eight of the most causative ones and used for flood vulnerability mapping with three machine learning algorithms, Artificial Neural Network Multi-Layer Perceptron (ANN/MLP),Â Deep Learning Neural Network based approachâDL4j (DLNN-DL4j) and Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR). These algorithms show a good predictive performance with the receiver operating curve (ROC) value of 0.851, 0.877 and 0.697, respectively. The buildingsâ exposure to flood was assessed in line with criteria established in European and national legal regulations. The introduced new buildings' flood hazard index (BFH) revealed a significant similarity of potential flood risk for both models, highlighting the greatest risk in zones with high vulnerability to flooding. Depending on the method used, the BFH value was 0.54 (ANN), 0.52 (DLNNs) or 0.64 (BLR). The holistic approach proposed in this study could assist local authorities in improving flood management.

Remote sensing devices are becoming increasingly important in monitoring and assessing natural disaster susceptibility and hazards. The proposed research work pursues an assessment analysis of flood susceptibility in a tropical desert environment: a case study of Yemen. The base data for this research were collected and organized from meteorological, satellite images, remote sensing data, essential geographic data, and various data sources and used as input data into four machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this study, RS data (Sentinel-1 images) were used to detect flooded areas in the study area. We also used the Sentinel application platform (SNAP 7.0) for Sentinel-1 image analysis and detecting flood zones in the study locations. Flood spots were discovered and verified using Google Earth images, Landsat images, and press sources to create a flood inventory map of flooded areas in the study area. Four ML algorithms were used to map flash flood susceptibility (FFS) in Tarim city (Yemen): K-nearest neighbor (KNN), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), random forests (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Twelve flood conditioning factors were prepared, assessed in multicollinearity, and used with flood inventories as input parameters to run each model. A total of 600 random flood and non-flood points were chosen, where 75% and 25% were used as training and validation datasets. The confusion matrix and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were used to validate the susceptibility maps. The results obtained reveal that all models had a high capacity to predict floods (AUC > 0.90). Further, in terms of performance, the tree-based ensemble algorithms (RF, XGBoost) outperform other ML algorithms, where the RF algorithm provides robust performance (AUC = 0.982) for assessing flood-prone areas with only a few adjustments required prior to training the model. The value of the research lies in the fact that the proposed models are being tested for the first time in Yemen to assess flood susceptibility, which can also be used to assess, for example, earthquakes, landslides, and other disasters. Furthermore, this work makes significant contributions to the worldwide effort to reduce the risk of natural disasters, particularly in Yemen. This will, therefore, help to enhance environmental sustainability.

All models are evaluated by three metrics (accuracy, true positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and compared with a Bayesian approach.

What is the potential and accuracy of multivariate approaches relative to univariate ones? Can we effectively use these methods for extrapolation purposes, i.e., FH assessment outside the region used for setting up the model? Our study addresses these open problems by considering two separate issues: (1) mapping flood-prone areas and (2) predicting the expected water depth for a given inundation scenario. We blend seven geomorphic descriptors through decision tree models trained on target FH maps, referring to a large study area (? 105 km2). We discuss the potential of multivariate approaches relative to the performance of a selected univariate model and on the basis of multiple extrapolation experiments, where models are tested outside their training region. Our results show that multivariate approaches may (a) significantly enhance flood-prone area delineation (accuracy: 92%) relative to univariate ones (accuracy: 84%), (b) provide accurate predictions of expected inundation depths (determination coefficient ?0.7), and (c) produce encouraging results in extrapolation.

The primary variables considered in most of these works include terrain models, lithology, river networks and land use. While several recent studies include average annual rainfall and/or temperature, other meteorological information such as snow accumulation and short-term intense rain events that may influence the hydrology of the area under investigation have not been considered. Notably, in Canada, most inland flooding occurs during the freshet, due to the melting of an accumulated snowpack coupled with heavy rainfall. Therefore, in this study the impact of several climate variables along with various hydro-geomorphological (HG) variables were tested to determine the impact of their inclusion. Three tests were run: only HG variables, the addition of annual average temperature and precipitation (HG-PT), and the inclusion of six other meteorological datasets (HG-8M) on five study areas across Canada. In HG-PT, both precipitation and temperature were selected as important in every study area, while in HG-8M a minimum of three meteorological datasets were considered important in each study area. Notably, as the meteorological variables were added, many of the initial HG variables were dropped from the selection set. The accuracy, F1, true skill and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were marginally improved when the meteorological data was added to the a parallel random forest algorithm (parRF). When the model is applied to new data, the estimated accuracy of the prediction is higher in HG-8M, indicating that inclusion of relevant, local meteorological datasets improves the result.

An adverse events like floods, wildfires, cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc., are regarded as a natural disaster once it strikes the vulnerable population areas. An early tracking of susceptibility areas and immediate tracking of affected areas might help in facilitating rescue and early warnings to the public. To achieve autonomous natural disaster prediction, this paper makes use of current developments in remote sensing, which speed up the availability of aerial/satellite data and are reinforced by progress in the computing sector. The aerial/satellite imageries are employed for acquiring the data from areas of Queensland-Australia that are more prone to natural disaster in an eagle-eye perspective. Since there were several techniques employed so far for the automatic prediction of natural disaster susceptibilities, there were some limitations like reduced rate of accuracy and so on. So as to overcome these limitations, deep learning based automated process is employed for predicting the natural disaster areas and probability of event occurrences. The main intention of the work is to detect the natural disaster occurrence from the sensed data which aids in providing warning to public and to safeguard them by taking necessary actions. Initially, remote sensing data is pre-processed and the features are extracted using Adaptive linear Internal embedding algorithm-based feature extraction (ALIE-FE). The extracted features are selected using Recursive Wrapper-based feature subset selection. To estimate best fitness function and to enhance the prediction accuracy, the optimization process is carried using Bio-Inspired Squirrel Search Optimization algorithm (BI-SSOA). Finally, the classification is carried by means of Deep learning based Multi-layer Alex Net classifier (DBMLA) approach. The simulation is carried and the outcomes attained are estimated for predicting flood susceptibility and wildfire susceptibility. The proposed BISSOA-DBMLA offers sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 99%, and TSS of 97%. The proposed system offers 98.99% classification accuracy. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, TSS, and area under the curve (AUC) are used to evaluate the efficacy of the suggested system in light of the achieved results from other approaches. To demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested mechanism, the achieved results are compared with those of current approaches.

They also slow down a countryâs economy. Due to the dynamic and complex nature of floods, it is difficult to predict the areas that are prone to flooding. In this study, an attempt was made to create a suitability map for future urban development based on flood vulnerability maps for the catchment area of Taif, Saudi Arabia. Three models were used for this purpose, including bivariate (FR), multivariate (LR), and machine learning (SVM) were used. Thirteen parameters were used as flood-contributing parameters. The inventory map was constructed using field surveys, historical data, analysis of RADAR (Sentinel-1A), and Google Earth imagery collected between 2013 and 2020. In general, 70% flood locations were randomly selected from the flood inventory map to generate the flood susceptibility model, and the remaining 30% of the flood locations were used for model validation. The flood susceptibility map was classified into five zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The AUC value used to predict the performance of the models showed that the accuracy reached 89.5, 92.0, and 96.2% for the models FR, LR, and SVM, respectively. Accordingly, the flood susceptibility map produced by the SVM model is accurate and was used to produce a flood vulnerability map with the help of urban and road density maps. Then slope and elevation maps were integrated with the flood vulnerability model to produce the final suitability map, which was classified into three zones: isolated zone, low suitability, and high suitability areas. The results showed that the highly suitable areas are located in the east and northeast of the Taif Basin, where the flood risk is low and very low. The results of this work will improve the land use planning of engineers and authorities and take possible measures to reduce the flood hazards in the area.

The approach and results of this study can support national and local authorities, decision-makers, and other planners in the construction of appropriate strategies to reduce potential damage in the future.

Ensemble-based approaches have recently become popular in flash flood susceptibility modeling due to their strength and flexibility with data. This study aimed to incorporate new ensemble approaches to bivariate statistical model, such as the quantitative approach of weight of evidence (WOE) with multivariate statistical models, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and the K nearest neighbor (KNN) model. The Uttarakhand state of India was selected as a study area. A flash flood and geospatial database were developed in this regard. In the historical database, a total of 122 flash flood points were identified. A geospatial dataset was created with aspect, plan curvature, elevation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), annual rainfall, distance from river, distance from road, land use/cover (LULC), and sediment transport index (STI) in GIS. Weights were assigned to each influencing factor based on correlation using WOE in R open-source software, then ensembled with ANN, SVM, and KNN. Finally, all models were validated with different statistical indices, and subsequently, their performances were compared. All of the built models performed well, according to the results. However, WOE-ANN outperformed all machine learning models. The results of the study can help local governments and researchers with flash flood management.

However, assessing floodÂ risk zones is difficult because of complex physical processes. In this study, a two-step flood hazard zoning model based on the random forest (RF) and self-organizing map (SOM) is proposed to yield the flood hazard zones map. In the first step (flood susceptibility analysis), the flood conditioning factors are used to obtain the flood susceptibility values. In the second step (flood hazard zoning), the proposed model not only considers the flood susceptibility value of the self-pixel as the module input, but also simultaneously considers flood susceptibility values of surrounding pixels to yield the flood hazard zoning map. The proposed model was applied to the Lanyang Plain in Yilan County, Taiwan, to demonstrate its advantages. The results indicated that the proposed model with the flood susceptibility values of the self-pixel and surrounding pixels does improve the assessment performance, significantly improving percentage of the effective ratio (ER) from results for the very high and high-risk level zones is 6 and 46%, respectively. The ER of the proposed model also improved by 9.6 and 30% for the very high and high-risk level zones than the conventional model, and it could provide optimal flood hazard zoning maps. In conclusion, the proposed model is expected to be useful in supporting the formulation of adequate disaster mitigation strategies.

The primary objectives of the current work are to employ five well-known machine-learning algorithms, including the boosted regression tree (BRT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), generalized additive model (GAM), and generalized linear models (GLM), as intelligent methods and compare their proficiency in mapping the occurrence of flood hazards in the Saliantapeh basin, Golestan province, Iran, with an area of 4515.47 km2. Initially, 71 flood points are depicted to create a flood database map. Three data sets (i.e., ds1, ds2, and ds3) with a sample size of 30:70 are prepared using the random partitioning technique for evaluating the structure and accuracy of the models. Moreover, to model the flood potential, 16 conditioning factors related to floods (FCFs) are chosen as predictors. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) specifies the predictive model's ability to properly forecast flood event occurrence or nonflood occurrence. The applied models are executed properly both in predictive skill (area under the curve [AUC] value greater than 0.90) and in the degree of fitting (DOF), which results in valid predictions. In other words, the RF model displays better performance compared to other models for flood hazard prediction. It not only displays the best proficiency basis on the AUC approach but also provides the results of robust predictions once the data sets are varied. Moreover, by varying the learning and validation flood points, the performance of the RF method for modelling the flood occurrence is entirely stable. Therefore, this model should be investigated as an appropriate technique in other flood studies because it is able to generate robust and accurate flood potential maps for researchers, local governments, and planners in flood reduction strategies.

Efficient, accurate, and trustworthy methods for urban flood management have become increasingly important due to higher rainfall intensity caused by climate change, the expansion of cities, and changes in land use. While physically based flood models can provide reliable forecasts for water depth at every location of a catchment, their high computational burden is hindering their application to large urban areas at high spatial resolution. While deep learning models have been used to address this issue, a disadvantage is that they are often perceived as ""black-box"" models and are overconfident about their predictions, therefore decreasing their reliability. Our deep learning model learns the underlying phenomena a priori from simulated hydrodynamic data, obviating the need for manual parameter setting for every new rainfall event at test time. The only inputs needed at the test time are a rainfall forecast and parameters of the terrain such as a digital elevation model to predict the maximum water depth with uncertainty estimates for complete rainfall events. We validate the accuracy and generalisation capabilities of our approach through experiments on a dataset consisting of catchments within Switzerland and Portugal and 18 rainfall patterns. Our method produces flood hazard maps at 1 m resolution and achieves mean absolute errors as low as 21 cm for extreme flood cases with water above 1 m. Most importantly, we demonstrate that our approach is able to provide an uncertainty estimate for every water depth within the predicted hazard map, thus increasing the model's trustworthiness during flooding events.",WATER,10.3390/w14192980,0,0,No,Switzerland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposes the use of a deep learning model (DLM) to overcome these problems. We alleviated the high computational overhead of this approach by developing a novel framework for the construction of lightweight DLMs. The proposed scheme involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) by using a radar echo map in conjunction with historical flood records at target sites and using Grad-Cam to extract key grid cells from these maps (representing regions with the greatest impact on flooding) for use as inputs in another DLM. Finally, we used real radar echo maps of five locations and the flood heights record to verify the validity of the method proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that our proposed lightweight model can achieve similar or even better prediction accuracy at all locations with only about 5~15% of the operation time and about 30~35% of the memory space of the CNN.",WATER,10.3390/w14020155,0,0,No,Taiwan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data-driven models have been showing their ability to map flood susceptibility but their application in urban pluvial flooding is still rare.

(2) Evaluate the trained models' transferability in space. (3) Estimate the most useful factors for flood susceptibility mapping. The models' performance was validated using the Kappa, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results indicated that all models perform very well (minimum AUC = 0.87 for the testing dataset). The RF models outperformed all other models at all spatial resolutions and the RF model at 2 m spatial resolution was superior for the present flood inventory and predictor variables.

Rapidly changing conditions dictate the need for continuous and detailed ob-servations and analysis of climate-glacier dynamics. Thematic and quantitative information regarding glacier geometry is fundamental for understanding climate forcing and the sensitivity of glaciers to climate change, however, accurately mapping debris-cover glaciers (DCGs) is notoriously difficult based upon the use of spectral information and conventional machine-learning techniques. The objective of this research is to improve upon an earlier proposed deep-learning-based approach, GlacierNet, which was developed to exploit a convolutional neural-network segmentation model to accurately outline regional DCG ablation zones. Specifically, we devel-oped an enhanced GlacierNet2 architecture that incorporates multiple models, automatic post-processing, and basin-level hydrological flow techniques to improve the mapping of DCGs such that it includes both the ablation and accumulation zones. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GlacierNet2 improves the estimation of the ablation zone and allows a high level of intersection over union (IOU: 0.8839) score, which is higher than the GlacierNet (IOU: 0.8599). The proposed architecture provides complete glacier (both accumulation and ablation zone) outlines at regional scales, with an overall IOU score of 0.8619.

A neural network model is trained to exploit patterns in hyetographs as well as in topographical data, with the specific aim of enabling fast predictions of flood depths for observed rain events and spatial locations that have not been included in the training dataset. A neural network architecture that is widely used for image segmentation (U-NET) is adapted for this purpose. Key novelties are a systematic investigation of which spatial inputs should be provided to the deep learning model, which hyper-parametrization optimizes predictive performance, and a systematic evaluation of prediction performance for locations and rain events that were not considered in training. We find that a spatial input dataset of only 5 variables that describe local terrain shape and imperviousness is optimal to generate predictions of water depth. Neural network architectures with between 97,000 and 260,000,000 parameters are tested, and a model with 28,000,000 parameters is found optimal. U-FLOOD is demonstrated to yield similar predictive performance as existing screening approaches, even though the assessment is performed for natural rain events and in locations unknown to the network, and flood predictions are generated within seconds.

A rich volume of high-confidence historical pavement distress data was obtained from the Louisiana pavement management system. After a rigorous data pre-processing process by cross-referencing the flooded areas using the 2016 Louisiana flood map data, it was leveraged to analyze how flooding could interact with the pavement distress, thus affecting the overall performance of existing pavements.

The scenarios are based on the real Typhoon event TC9711 on August 18, 1997, whereby the wind wave. tide. 1D flood, and 2D flood processes are simulated and flood scenarios of four different return periods are extrapolated. Especially, for future scenarios in 2050, sea level rise and land subsidence are also considered. Third, the expected annual damage (EAD) is estimated via risk analysis technique with combination of flood maps in the four return periods and the fine-scale exposure data. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis was done to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two flood adaptation measures, i.e., dry flood-proofing and wet flood-proofing measures, for residential buildings. Taking Shanghai as an example, the above methods were applied to comprehensively assess the storm-caused flood risk of residential buildings, its future trends to 2050, and the costs and benefits of two adaptation measures. The results show that: (1) Sea-level rise and land subsidence will significantly exacerbate the flood risks in Shanghai. (2) Under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP8.5 High-end), the area of exposed residential buildings in Shanghai by 2050 may reach 31-49 km(2) (4%-6% of total building area) for a 1/200-year storm flood event and 180-206 km(2) (14%-16%) for a 1/5000-year event. (3) The EAD of residential buildings in 2017 is 440 million CNY (65.4 million USD), which can increase 1.6-2.0 times and reach to CNY 700 million-900 million (104.0 million-133.8 million USD) in 2050. (4) The implementation of both dry and wet flood-proofing measures could potentially reduce the EAD by 76%-79% and 88%-90%, respectively. Both measures are considerably cost-effective: the net present values of dry and wet flood-proofing measures are 2.84 billion-5.53 billion CNY (0.4 billion-0.8 billion USD) and 5.85 billion-9.94 billion CNY (0.9 billion-1.5 billion USD), and the benefit/cost ratios arc 1.9-2.4 and 7.9-9.8 respectively. This indicates that the cost-effectiveness of dry flood-proofing measures is less than that of wet measure. Our findings can provide both scientific understanding and effective adaptation measures for mitigating the future flood risk in Shanghai. These multidisciplinary methods could also be applied to assess flood risk and adaptation strategies in other coastal cities.",CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE,10.1360/TB-2020-1536,0,0,No,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of them are supervised techniques, which usually require large amounts of training data and are limited to a particular application. Self-supervised methods solve these problems and are widely used in unsupervised binary change detection tasks. However, the existing self-supervised methods in change detection are suboptimal for pixel-wise change detection tasks. In this work, a pixel-wise contrastive approach is proposed to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by using contrastive loss in superpixel-level features on an unlabeled multiview setting. In this approach, a pseudo-Siamese network is trained to obtain pixel-wise representations and to align features from shifted image pairs. The final binary change map is obtained by using thresholding methods on learned temporal features. To overcome the season-related noise in binary change maps, we also used an uncertainty method to enhance the temporal robustness of the proposed approach. Two homogeneous (OSCD and MUDS) datasets and one heterogeneous (California Flood) dataset are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Results demonstrate improvements in both efficiency and accuracy over the patch-wise multiview contrastive method.",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING,10.1109/TGRS.2022.3203897,0,0,No,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, flood risk can be mitigated through event planning and city-wide preparation to reduce damage. For, governments, firms, and civilians to make such preparations, flood susceptibility predictions are required. To predict flood susceptibility nine environmental related factors have been identified. They are elevation, slope, curvature, topographical wetness index (TWI), Euclidean distance from a river, land-cover, stream power index (SPI), soil type and precipitation. This work will use these environmental related factors alongside Sentinel-1 satellite imagery in a model intercomparison study to back-predict flood susceptibility in Jakarta for the January 2020 historic flood event across 260 key locations. For each location, this study uses current environmental conditions to predict flood status in the following month. Considering the imbalance between instances of flooded and non-flooded conditions, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) has been implemented to balance both classes in the training set. This work compares predictions from artificial neural networks (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms (k-NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) against a random baseline. The effects of the SMOTE are also assessed by training each model on balanced and imbalanced datasets. The ANN is found to be superior to the other machine learning models.

Between 1998-2018, floods affected more than 2 billion people worldwide. Humans don't have much influence over preventing this natural calamity, but a mitigation measure can be taken to rescue the lives under such critical circumstances. But can plan ahead of time for rescue operations in the impacted areas to move people and animals to a safer location where time is very critical. When the environmental conditions are adverse or non-supportive, it is difficult to detect humans and animals using conventional approaches. Accurate, in time detection and immediate provision of life saving measures are the key to rescue the survivors during disastrous situation. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's) can be used to collect real-time images from low altitude airspace to get the aerial view of the images which in turn supports vast emergency rescues. The major challenge wit this is to dynamically process huge amount of data to identify and locate such affected people in real time. Due to significant development in Deep learning technologies, object detection in UAV images that aims to identify humans and animals can be accomplished. This paper proposes a Deep-learning based efficient emergency response model [RescueNet] for helping Rescue system in detecting survivors in flood devastated regions during response activities. Results obtained from the implementation of the proposed model shows the effectiveness of the model in detecting and counting the affected people and animals. The model shows a precision of 0.98, recall of 0.97, an F1-score of 0.94 and means average precision (mAP) of 98% which significantly proved that, the proposed model could certainly help the rescue system in providing the on-time response for saving lives.",MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT,10.1007/s40808-022-01414-6,0,0,No,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have a considerable impact on the economy and can result in significant loss of life. Several strategies, including studies by advanced data analysis methods, have been adopted to curb this phenomenon and ultimately limit the accompanying damage. In this study, four supervised models based on machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to map flood vulnerability in the Souss watershed located in southern Morocco. They include random forest, x-gradient boost, k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural network. Thirteen predisposing factors including aspect, curvature, digital elevation model (DEM), distance to rivers, drainage density, flow accumulation, flow direction, geology, land use, rainfall, slope, soil type, and topographic wetness index (TWI) were selected as inputs to achieve this. Four different models were developed for each ML algorithm based on variable selection and one-hot encoding. Overall, all the models of the four algorithms have an AUC score above 80% for the testing data, which means that they all performed very well. The ranking of the ML algorithms used by considering only the most efficient model of each algorithm is as follows: KNN (98.6%), RF (98.1%), XGB (97.2%), and NNET (95.9%). Finally, all the models were overlaid to identify points of agreement or disagreement. This study provides evidence of ML models being successful in mapping flood vulnerability.

The use of drainage systems not only reduces subsurface water table to prevent waterlogging and flooding but also increases nutrient losses by developing artificial preferential flow paths. The exact locations of subsurface drainage pipes are thus imperative to manage and monitor water quality and nonpoint source pollution. However, such data are not widely available due to private ownership. Previous studies used conventional image filtering methods, thermal images, and ground penetration radar to detect subsurface drainage pipes. Due to surface features, such as furrow and depressions, and their limited data availability, these experiments did not provide a robust approach to identify subsurface drainage pipes over a large area. To overcome these limitations, in this study, we propose a subsurface drainage pipe detection approach based on deep learning with optical images. Our deep learning approach uses a fully convolution network (FCN) architecture that takes an optical image patch as an input and gives an output of pixel-wise drainage pipe detection map. The FCN was trained and validated using optical image datasets obtained from a freeware Google Earth that provides temporally and spatially abundant data. The trained FCN was then applied to large-scale drainage pipe detection tasks to evaluate its performance. The performance comparison between the proposed deep learning approach and conventional image processing techniques (Sobel and Canny edge detection methods) was also carried out. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning approach shows accurate and robust drain line detection performance with an average Dice coefficient of 0.58 for validation sets, providing superior performance over the conventional image processing techniques.",AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,10.1016/j.agwat.2021.106791,0,0,No,"United States,South Korea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To help in the solution, it is necessary to develop strategies that maximize agricultural production as well as reduce land wear, environmental impact, and contamination of water resources. The generation of crop and land-use maps is advantageous for identifying suitable crop areas and collecting precise information about the produce. In this work, a strategy is proposed to identify and map sorghum and corn crops as well as land use and land cover. Our approach uses Sentinel-2 satellite images, spectral indices for the phenological detection of vegetation and water bodies, and automatic learning methods: support vector machine, random forest, and classification and regression trees.

This work develops a novel methodology for topsoil Ks mapping at the catchment scale, based on auxiliary data that are quick to determine and low-cost. It includes a double-scale sampling of the K-s to account for small-scale variability in the spatial geostatistical interpolation. A supervised selection of variables through correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering of variables precedes the development of site-specific pedotransfer functions (PTFs) with machine learning techniques. The approach was applied to a heavily anthropized area subject to flooding on the island of Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. The variable selection process filtered out four predictor variables from the initial pool of fourteen predictors. An artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer and six input variables (latitude, longitude, silt, clay, medium sand, and land use) provided the best K-s prediction model. Latitude and longitude coordinates and land use are surrogates for other physical and environmental factors. This ANN was found to be much more accurate than other classical PTFs. The ANN was used to estimate new K-s values from a subsequent sampling of model covariates, which allowed doubling the input information for spatial interpolation using ordinary kriging (OK). The consistency of the resulting K-s map was evaluated by direct comparison with a geomorphological base map.

Furthermore, the administrative measures in two phases of during and after the flood are prioritized by using the AHP method and questionnaires completed by experts and relief workers in flood management. Findings Among the ML algorithms, the SVM method was selected with 91.37% accuracy. The prioritization program provided by the model, which distinguishes it from other existing models, considers five conditions of the flood occurrence to prioritize actions (season, population affected, area affected, damage to houses and human lives lost).

However, mapping soil moisture has remained a scientific challenge due to forest canopy cover and small-scale variations in soil moisture conditions. When accurately scaled, terrain indices constitute a good candidate for modelling the spatial variation of soil moisture conditions in many landscapes. In this study, we evaluated seven different terrain indices at varying digital elevation model (DEM) resolutions and user-defined thresholds as well as two available soil moisture maps, using an extensive field dataset (398 plots) of soil moisture conditions registered in five classes from a survey covering a (68 km(2)) boreal landscape. We found that the variation in soil moisture conditions could be explained by terrain indices, and the best predictors within the studied landscape were the depth to water index (DTW) and a machine-learning-generated map. Furthermore, this study showed a large difference between terrain indices in the effects of changing DEM resolution and user-defined thresholds, which severely affected the performance of the predictions. For example, the commonly used topographic wetness index (TWI) performed best on a resolution of 16 m, while TWI calculated on DEM resolutions higher than 4 m gave inaccurate results. In contrast, depth to water (DTW) and elevation above stream (EAS) were more stable and performed best on 1-2 m DEM resolution. None of the terrain indices performed best on the highest DEM resolution of 0.5 m. In addition, this study highlights the challenges caused by heterogeneous soil types within the study area and shows the need of local knowledge when interpreting the modelled results. The results from this study clearly demonstrate that when using terrain indices to represent soil moisture conditions, modelled results need to be validated, as selecting an unsuitable DEM resolution or user-defined threshold can give ambiguous and even incorrect results.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,10.5194/hess-26-4837-2022,0,0,No,Sweden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the high computational efficiency, superior performance and simple modeling process, the deep learning models are expected to become a powerful tool for near real time flood early warning.

Recent geospatial practices advocated a multi-hazard analysis approach supported by artificial intelligence. This study proposes the Multi-Geoenvironmental Hazards Susceptibility (MGHS) tool, by combining Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with Machine Learning (ML) over the North-Moungo perimeter (Littoral Region, Cameroon). Methods: Twenty-four factors were constructed from satellite imagery, global geodatabase and fieldwork data. Multicollinearity among these factors was quantified using the tolerance coefficient (TOL) and variance inflation factor (VIF). The AHP coefficients were used to weigh the factors and produce a preliminary map per Geoenvironmental hazard through weighted linear combination (WLC). The sampling was conducted based on events records and analyst knowledge to proceed with classification using Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing interface. Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), were used as basic learners of the stacked hazard factors, whereas, Support Vector Regression (SVR), was used for a meta-learning. Results: The rainfall was ranked as the highest triggering factor for all Geoenvironmental hazards according to AHP, with a coefficient of 1, while the after-learning importance assessment was more varied. The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC/AUC) was always more than 0.96, and F1-score is between [0.86â0.88] for basic classifiers. Landslides, gully erosion and flash floods showed different spatial distributions, confirming then their probability of co-occurrence. MGHS outputs clearly displayed two and three simultaneous occurrences. Finally, the human vulnerability assessed with population layer and SVR outputs showed that high human concentrations are also the most exposed, using the example of Nkongsambaâs extract. Conclusions: Combining AHP with single learners, then a meta-learner, was efficient in modelling MGHS and related human vulnerability. Interactions among geo-environmental hazards are the next step and city councils are recommended to integrate results in the planning process.

This hinders predictive efforts, leading to significant impacts on human life and economies. Multi-hazard prediction is vital for any natural hazard risk management plan. The main objective of this study was the development of a multi-hazard susceptibility mapping framework, by combining two natural hazardsâflooding and landslidesâin the North Central region of Vietnam. This was accomplished using support vector machines, random forest, and AdaBoost. The input data consisted of 4591 flood points, 1315 landslide points, and 13 conditioning factors, split into training (70%), and testing (30%) datasets. The accuracy of the models' predictions was evaluated using the statistical indices root mean square error, area under curve (AUC), mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. All proposed models were good at predicting multi-hazard susceptibility, with AUC values over 0.95. Among them, the AUC value for the support vector machine model was 0.98 and 0.99 for landslide and flood, respectively. For the random forest model, these values were 0.98 and 0.98, and for AdaBoost, they were 0.99 and 0.99. The multi-hazard maps were built by combining the landslide and flood susceptibility maps. The results showed that approximately 60% of the study area was affected by landslides, 30% by flood, and 8% by both hazards. These results illustrate how North Central is one of the regions of Vietnam that is most severely affected by natural hazards, particularly flooding, and landslides. The proposed models adapt to evaluate multi-hazard susceptibility at different scales, although expert intervention is also required, to optimize the algorithms. Multi-hazard maps can provide a valuable point of reference for decision makers in sustainable land-use planning and infrastructure development in regions faced with multiple hazards, and to prevent and reduce more effectively the frequency of floods and landslides and their damage to human life and property.

It first performs region delineation, matching, and fusion. Next, it applies subspace learning in the joint regional space to produce a change map. It identifies the damaged regions by estimating probabilistic subspace distances and rejecting the non-disaster changes. We evaluated the performance of our method on seven disaster datasets including four wildfire events, two flooding events, and a earthquake/tsunami event. We validated our results by calculating the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and accuracy of classification between our disaster maps and ground-truth data. Our method produced average DSC values of 0.833 and 0.736, for wildfires and floods, respectively, and overall DSC of 0.855 for the tsunami event.

However, historical FID are insufficient in many regions. Remote sensing provides a promising opportunity to expand the FID. However, whether the FID expanded by remote sensing can improve the accuracy of flood susceptibility modeling needs further study. In this study, a framework was proposed for improving the accuracy of flood susceptibility prediction (FSP) by combining machine learning models and the expanded FID using Sentinel-1A radar images. Five widely used machine learning models were employed to verify the accuracy of the proposed method by taking Wuhan City as a case study, including the random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Sentinel-1A images from time points before, during, and after flood events were used to expand the FID for training the machine learning models. The results showed that the performance of the machine learning models for predicting flood susceptibility was improved greatly by considering the expanded FID, being improved by approximately 1.14â19.74% based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Among the used machine learning models, taking into account all the statistical indicators, the ANN showed the best performance, while the SVM showed the best generalization performance in Wuhan City. According to the results of the ANN model, approximately 19% of the area in Wuhan City, mainly distributed near rivers and lakes, is at a high flood susceptibility level.

The quality of the flood susceptibility model relies on the learning technique and the data used for learning. The performance of learning techniques has been extensively examined. However, to date, the impact of data sampling strategies has received limited attention. Random sampling is widely favored because of its ease of use. It treats flood-related data as tabular and excludes their spatial dimensions. Flood occurrence is typically uneven over space. Therefore, non-flood sampling should not be completely random. To represent the impact of the spatial dimension, this study proposed a new sampling approach based on spatial dependence, called inverse-occurrence sampling. It selects more non-flood data in low-risk areas than in high-risk areas. The new sampling approach was compared with random and stratified sampling, using six machine learning techniques in two urban areas in Guangzhou, China, with distinct flood mechanisms, that is, Tianhe (flood density 1.5/km2, clustered distribution, average slope 9.02Â°, downtown district) and Panyu (flood density 0.15/km2, random distribution, average slope 4.55Â°, suburban district). Learning techniques include support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), CNN-SVM, and CNN-RF. The main findings of this study were as follows: (1) Sampling approaches had a greater impact on model performance than learning techniques in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC variations caused by learning techniques ranged from 0.04 to 0.09. Meanwhile, the AUC variations caused by sampling approaches were between 0.15 and 0.22, all larger than 0.1. (2) The new sampling approach outperformed that of the other two sampling approaches for high average AUC values and small AUC variations. The outperformance is robust in regard to multiple learning techniques and different flooding mechanisms. AUCs in the inverse group had a narrower range (0.14â0.18 in Tianhe and 0.35â0.39 in Panyu) than in the random group (0.24â0.28 in Tianhe and 0.43â0.53 in Panyu) and the stratified group (0.23â0.30 in Tianhe and 0.42â0.48 in Panyu). (3) The most accurate learning technique for AUC was CNN-RF, followed by SVM, CNN-SVM, RF, CNN, and ANN. (4) ANN- and CNN-based models tended to produce polarized patterns in flood susceptibility maps, contradicting the ascending order of flood density with increasing susceptibility levels. Flood density outliers tended to appear in the models derived using RF and CNN-RF. Finally, the newly proposed sampling approach is suggested to be applied to flood susceptibility mapping to reflect the impact of spatial dependence.

In this study, we employ advanced remote sensing and machine learning methodologies to investigate the effects of flooding on biodiversity, from individual species to broader ecological communities. Specifically, we utilized Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and an ensemble of machine-learning algorithms to derive a flood susceptibility indicator. Our primary objective is to investigate the potential benefits of incorporating flood susceptibility, as a proxy for flood risk, into species distribution models (SDMs). By doing so, we aim to improve the performance of SDMs and gain deeper insights into the consequences of floods to biodiversity. Within the biodiverse landscape of the Zagros Mountains, a crucial Irano-Anatolian biodiversity hotspots, we examined the sensitivity of mammals, amphibians, and reptilesâ distributions to flooding. Our analysis compared the performance of models that combined flood susceptibility with climate variables against models relying solely on climate variables. The results indicate that the inclusion of flood susceptibility significantly improves the capacity of models to explain and map species distributions for 67% of the species in our study region. Notably, amphibians and mammals are more profoundly affected by flooding compared to reptiles. The study highlights the importance of incorporating flood susceptibility as a predictor variable in species distribution models to improve the baseline characterization of potential species distributions. The importance of this variable will obviously depend on the regional context and the species studied but its relevance is likely to increase with climate change. In summary, our research demonstrates the integration of remote sensing and machine learning as a potent approach to advance biodiversity data science, monitoring, and conservation in the face of climate-induced flooding.

Model performance was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve, which showed an area under the curve of 0.925 and an overall accuracy score of 80%. The important flood-influencing factors (FIFs) were investigated using both feature importance scores and the SHapely Additive exPlanations method (SHAP), creating a flood hazard map of the region and a map of SHAP contributions. It was found that the elevation, slope, and normalised difference vegetation index were the most important FIFs overall. However, in some regions, the distance to the river and the stream power index dominated for a similar flood hazard susceptibility outcome. Validation using SHAP to test the physical reasoning of the model confirmed the reliability of the flood hazard map.

So far, few studies into inundation susceptibility have explicitly incorporated the effects of climate change into their methodologies. This study aimed to assess inundation susceptibility for Vinh Phuc province in Vietnam, from 2000 to 2020, using machine learning and remote sensing. The algorithms used were support vector machine, catboost, and extratrees. A geo-spatial database of 206 inundation points and 11 conditioning factors (namely elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, distance to river, distance to road, NDVI, NDBI, rainfall, soil type, and TWI) from 2000 to 2020 was developed to be used as the input data. RMSE, MAE, AUC, and RÂ² were used to assess the fit of the models. The results showed that all the proposed models were a good fit, with AUC values of 0.95 and over. In general, the total area marked as very low risk or low risk has increased, with the high risk and very high-risk areas having decreased over the period studied. This change was mainly concentrated in the city of Vinh Yen where there has been strong urban growth. The models proposed in this study are a promising toolkit to assess inundation susceptibility continuously and can support decision makers involved in sustainable development. Our results highlight the benefits and consequences of planned and unplanned development. Properly planned can reduce the flood risk, while unplanned development can increase the risk. Therefore, by applying the theoretical framework in this study, decision makers or planners can build the most appropriate strategies for flood control in the context of climate change. Our approach in this study represents a theoretical framework for future research not only on inundation management but also natural hazard management, in regions around the world.

This study develops and tests a deep learning approach for large-scale spatial flood modeling, using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and optimized versions combined with the Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) or the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA). With Sweden as an application case for nation-wide flood susceptibility mapping, this modeling approach considers ten geo-environmental input factors (slope, elevation, aspect, plan curvature, length of slope, topographic wetness index, distance from river, distance from wetland, rainfall, and land use). The GWO and ICA optimization improves model prediction by 12% and 8%, respectively, compared with the standalone CNN model performance. The results show 40% of the land area, 45% of the railroad, and 43% of the road network of Sweden to have high or very high flood susceptibility. They also show the aspect to have the highest input factor impact on flood susceptibility prediction while, for example, rainfall ranks only seven of the total 10 considered geo-environmental input factors. In general, accurate nation-wide flood susceptibility prediction is essential for guiding flood management and mitigation efforts. This study's approach to such prediction has emerged as well-performing and cost-effective for the case of Sweden, calling for further application and testing in other world regions.

The majority of studies, however, have concentrated on creating models for particular water sources, drainage systems, and gauge stations area. Therefore, unless further data is supplied and the models are subsequently trained, their outcomes cannot be effectively applied to different scenarios. With its excellent spatio-temporal accuracy range with the advanced analytics, the forthcoming Global Navigations Satellite Systems (GNSSs) technology offers a novel method for the monitoring of flood disasters in dynamic manner. This study recommends a Multi-layered Neural Network (MNN) for flood monitoring, which combines a Convolutional Neural Networking (CNN) along with a backward propagation based (BP) learning network. The CNN component is used to obtain the abstracted features from full delay doppler maping images. The BP section is provided with GNSSs characteristics, such as reflection of surface with power range, and also the vegetation attributes from the Soil Moistening Active Passives (SMAP) satellite source data. In comparison to physiologically based models, the results shown that the CNN-oriented system makes accurate predictions on ""unseen"" areas of catchment with a substantially shorter processing time. The obtained results imply that, with respect to accuracy of prediction, the patch-enabled option is superior to the resizing-based option. Additionally, every experiment has demonstrated that the forecast of flow speed is more precise than the prognosis of water depth, indicating that the water deposition is more complex to information about global level elevations than the flow speed with velocity.

Because of its capacity to penetrate clouds and operate in all kinds of weather, synthetic aperture radar is preferred for water inundation mapping. Flood mapping in Eastern Indiaâs Baitarani River Basin for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 was performed in this study using Sentinel-1 imagery and Google Earth Engine with Otsuâs algorithm. Different machine-learning algorithms were used to map the LULC of the study region. Dual polarizations VH and VV and their combinations VVÃVH, VV+VH, VHâVV, VVâVH, VV/VH, and VH/VV were examined to identify non-water and water bodies. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) map derived from Sentinel-2 data validated the surface water inundation with 80% accuracy. The total inundated areas were identified as 440.3 km2 in 2018, 268.58 km2 in 2019, 178.40 km2 in 2020, 203.79 km2 in 2021, and 321.33 km2 in 2022, respectively. The overlap of flood maps on the LULC map indicated that flooding highly affected agriculture and urban areas in these years. The approach using the near-real-time Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and GEE platform can be operationalized for periodic flood mapping, helps develop flood control measures, and helps enhance flood management. The generated annual flood inundation maps are also useful for policy development, agriculture yield estimation, crop insurance framing, etc. Â© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,10.1007/s10661-023-11876-5,0,0,No,"India,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Creating a flood susceptibility map (FSM) that pinpoints the areas most at risk of flooding is a crucial non-structural solution for managing floods. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of combinations of the random forest (RF) model with three biology-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, namely invasive weed optimization (IWO), slime mould algorithm (SMA), and satin bowerbird optimization (SBO), for flood susceptibility mapping in Estahban town, Iran. Initially, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1) and optical (Landsat-8) satellite images were integrated to monitor the flooded areas during the July 2022 monsoon in the study area. A dataset of 509 flood occurrence points was created to identify flood-prone areas using remote sensing techniques, considering the monitored flood areas. The dataset also included twelve flood-related criteria: topography, land cover, and climate. The holdout method was employed for modeling, with a ratio of 70:30 used for the train/test split. Data pre-processing techniques were conducted to improve model performance, including determining criteria importance and addressing multicollinearity issues using certainty factor (CF), multicollinearity, and information gain ratio (IGR) methods. Then FSM was prepared using RF, RF-IWO, RF-SBO, and RF-SMA models. The findings of this research revealed that the RF-IWO model was the best predictive model of flood susceptibility modeling, with root-mean-square-error (RMSE) (0.211 and 0.0.27), mean-absolute-error (MAE) (0.103 and 0.15), and coefficient-of-determination (R2) (0.821 and 0.707) in the training and testing phases, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of FSM revealed that the most accurate models were the RF-IWO (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.983), RF-SBO (AUC = 0.979), RF-SMA (AUC = 0.963), and RF (AUC = 0.959), respectively. Integrating biology-inspired computing algorithms with machine learning algorithms presents a novel approach to enhancing the accuracy of FSMs. Â© 2023",Journal of Environmental Management,10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118790,0,0,Yes,South Korea,RF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A flood can be an inconvenience or a catastrophic event, resulting in long-term economic and environmental consequences. Flood extent mapping identifies and delineates the areas that are inundated. The study focuses on the flood event of Wardha river near Chandrapur on 12th August, 2022. In this study, we proposed an ensemble averaging model (EAM) for optimizing the accuracy of flood inundation mapping that discriminates flood waters from the non-flood waters using stack of multitemporal Sentinel-1 satellite imagery. Sentinel-1 uses C-band microwave signals to measure backscatter from the Earth's surface with its synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor that can penetrate clouds and collects data regardless of weather conditions.

The traditional research of landslide disaster based on experience-driven or statistical model and its assessment results are subjective, difficult to quantify, and no pertinence. As a new research method for landslide susceptibility assessment, machine learning can greatly improve the landslide susceptibility model's accuracy by constructing statistical models. Taking Western Henan for example, the study selected 16 landslide influencing factors such as topography, geological environment, hydrological conditions, and human activities, and 11 landslide factors with the most significant influence on the landslide were selected by the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. Five machine learning methods [Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)] were used to construct the spatial distribution model of landslide susceptibility. The models were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve and statistical index. After analysis and comparison, the XGBoost model (AUC 0.8759) performed the best and was suitable for dealing with regression problems. The model had a high adaptability to landslide data. According to the landslide susceptibility map of the five models, the overall distribution can be observed. The extremely high and high susceptibility areas are distributed in the Funiu Mountain range in the southwest, the Xiaoshan Mountain range in the west, and the Yellow River Basin in the north. These areas have large terrain fluctuations, complicated geological structural environments and frequent human engineering activities. The extremely high and highly prone areas were 12043.3 km2 and 3087.45 km2, accounting for 47.61% and 12.20% of the total area of the study area, respectively. Our study reflects the distribution of landslide susceptibility in western Henan Province, which provides a scientific basis for regional disaster warning, prediction, and resource protection. The study has important practical significance for subsequent landslide disaster management. Â©2023 China Geology Editorial Office. Â© 2023 Editorial Office of China Geology.

The Pannonian-Carpathian Basin is particularly affected by the increasing frequency of hazardous hydrological events. Agricultural production, which is a highly significant economic sector in the region, is particularly vulnerable to these unfavourable climatic conditions. Changes in precipitation patterns and soil moisture levels can lead to reduced crop yields, while floods can pollute water sources and erode fertile soil. Mapping of Inland Excess Water (IEW), also known as ponding water or waterlogged areas, is crucial for informed decision-making, damage compensation, risk management, and future prevention planning. Remote sensing technology and machine learning have been demonstrated to be valuable tools for the mapping of IEW. The 2014 floods in Southeastern and Central Europe serve as a reminder of the importance of effective flood risk management. This study used a Geographical Information System (GIS) and a Semi-automated Classification Processing (SCP) tool to process high-resolution RapidEye satellite images from the 2014 floods in the Srem region of Serbia. The Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) classification model was used to produce a map of IEW. The SAM model achieved an overall accuracy of 92.68 %. The study found that IEW affected approximately 2.90 % or 99.59 kmÂ² of the territory in Srem. The obtained maps can be used by responsible water management agencies to prevent and control excessive inland water.

Flood dates were identified using nonscientific data sources, and then large-scale climate variables, that is, integrated vapour transport (IVT) and geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500) along with rainfall at daily scale were considered. SOM was applied on IVT and results indicated large spatial scale- and season-specific mechanisms in addition to local circulation systemsâthis highlights SOM's ability to cluster circulation mechanisms as per the relevance. The rainy seasons, that is, monsoon and postmonsoon showed well-known moisture pathways. While synoptic systems can be easily linked with monsoon and postmonsoon mechanisms, it is interesting to note that the local systems exist even during the monsoon and postmonsoon season in addition to the summer season. Spatial patterns of Z500 corresponding to SOM nodes of IVT showed the presence of low-pressure systems (LPSs), tropical cyclones and trough systems. Further analysis was performed, and a total of 35 atmospheric rivers (ARs) were identified. Plots of back trajectories for the selected AR events indicated that Arabian Sea is the main source of moisture in the monsoon season followed by Bay of Bengal for postmonsoon and tropical cyclones in summer season events. Additionally, moisture from land is also observed as another source of moisture. Back-trajectory analysis further indicated AR-LPS interaction during the monsoon and ARs feeding moisture to LPSs. Overall, well-known and season-specific synoptic systems that brought significant rainfall to the study region were identified by the SOM. The proposed framework is adaptable for different locations, and as floods in cities across the globe are on the rise, these findings will have a prominent role in urban flood forecasting and management.

However, they are usually computationally expensive and unsuitable for parameter optimizations that need many runs. An alternative is the machine learning (ML) method, which can be used to construct computationally efficient surrogates for PBMs that can approximate their input-output dynamics. Among many ML techniques, convolutional neural network (CNN) is a prevalent method for image-to-image regressions on structured or regular meshes (e.g., mapping from the boundary conditions to flow solutions of SWEs). However, CNN-based methods have significant limitations because of their raster-image nature. Such methods cannot precisely capture the boundary geometry of obstacles and near-field flow features, which are of paramount importance to fluid dynamics. We introduced an efficient, accurate, and flexible neural network (NN) surrogate model [which is based on deep learning and can make point-to-point (p2p) predictions on unstructured meshes] called NN-p2p. The new method was evaluated and compared against CNN-based methods. NN-p2p improves the accuracy of the near-field flow prediction with a mean relative error of 0.56% for the velocity magnitude around piers with unseen length/width ratios. It also respects conservation laws more strictly than the CNN-based models and performs reasonably well for spatial extrapolation. The surrogate reduces computing time by almost 3-orders of magnitude in comparison with its corresponding PBM. Moreover, as a demonstration of the NN-p2p model's practical applicability, we calculated drag coefficient using NN-p2p for piers of varying length-to-width ratios and obtained a novel linear relationship between the drag coefficient and the logarithmic transformation of the pier's geometry.

However, the general public often struggles with the complexity and extensive temporal range of meteorological data when attempting to accurately forecast climate extremes. Sequence disorder, weak robustness, low characteristics and weak interpretability are four prevalent shortcomings in predicting long-time-series data. In order to resolve these deficiencies, our study gives a novel hybrid spatiotemporal model which offers comprehensive data preprocessing techniques, focusing on data decomposition, feature extraction and dimensionality upgrading. This model provides a feasible solution to the puzzling problem of long-term climate prediction. Firstly, we put forward a Period Division Region Segmentation Property Extraction (PD-RS-PE) approach, which divides the data into a stationary series (SS) for an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) prediction and an oscillatory series (OS) for a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) prediction to accommodate the changing trend of data sequences. Secondly, a new type of input-output mapping mode in a three-dimensional matrix was constructed to enhance the robustness of the prediction. Thirdly, we implemented a multi-layer technique to extract features of high-speed input data based on a Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for parameter searching of a neural network, thereby enhancing the overall systemâs learning ability. Consequently, by integrating all the above innovative technologies, a novel hybrid SS-OS-PSO-DBN-ELM-LSTME (SOPDEL) model with comprehensive data preprocessing was established to improve the quality of long-time-series forecasting. Five models featuring partial enhancements are discussed in this paper and three state-of-the-art classical models were utilized for comparative experiments. The results demonstrated that the majority of evaluation indices exhibit a significant optimization in the proposed model. Additionally, a relevant evaluation system showed that the quality of âExcellent Predictionâ and âGood Predictionâ exceeds 90%, and no data with âBad Predictionâ appear, so the accuracy of the prediction process is obviously insured.

The six models were trained and tested using a sample database constructed from historical flood events in Hefei, China. The results demonstrated the following findings: (1) the RF model exhibited the highest accuracy, while the SVR model underestimated the extent of extremely high-risk areas. The stacking model underestimated the extent of very-high-risk areas. It should be noted that the prediction results of ensemble learning methods may not be superior to those of the base models upon which they are built. (2) The predicted high-risk and very-high-risk areas within the study area are predominantly clustered in low-lying regions along the rivers, aligning with the distribution of hazardous areas observed in historical inundation events. (3) It is worth noting that the factor of distance to pumping stations has the second most significant driving influence after the DEM (Digital Elevation Model). This underscores the importance of considering human resilience factors.

Remote sensing and machine learning are used to acquire vegetation maps, which, due to the development of sensors and data processing and analysis methods, have increasingly high accuracy. The objectives of this study were to test: (i) which of the textural information (TI) features have the highest information potential for identifying wetland communities; and (ii) whether the use of TI improves the accuracy of wetland communities mapping using hyperspectral (HS) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data. The analysis indicated that the mean and entropy features of the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix had the highest potential to differentiate between various wetland communities. Adding these features to the dataset resulted in a small increase (0.005) in average F1 accuracy based on HS data and 0.011 for HS and ALS scenarios in wetland communities classification, and adding TI improved the delineation of patch boundaries. A higher increase was noted for forest and scrub vegetation (by 0.019 for the HS scenario and 0.022 for the HS and ALS scenario) and rushes (only for the HS and ALS scenario 0.017). It can be concluded that it is reasonable to use textural information for mapping wetland communities, especially for areas with a high proportion of scrub and forest and rushes vegetation included in the analysis.

Existing road inundation studies either lack empirical data for model validations or focus mainly on road inundation exposure assessment based on flood maps. This study addresses this limitation by using crowdsourced and fine-grained traffic data as an indicator of road inundation, and topographic, hydrologic, and temporal precipitation features as predictor variables. Two tree-based machine learning models (random forest and AdaBoost) were then tested and trained for predicting road inundations in the contexts of 2017 Hurricane Harvey and 2019 Tropical Storm Imelda in Harris County, Texas. The findings from Hurricane Harvey indicate that precipitation is the most important feature for predicting road inundation susceptibility, and that topographic features are more critical than hydrologic features for predicting road inundations in both storm cases. The random forest and AdaBoost models had relatively high AUC scores (0.860 and 0.810 for Harvey respectively and 0.790 and 0.720 for Imelda respectively) with the random forest model performing better in both cases. The random forest model showed stable performance for Harvey, while varying significantly for Imelda. This study advances the emerging field of smart flood resilience in terms of predictive flood risk mapping at the road level. In particular, such models could help impacted communities and emergency management agencies develop better preparedness and response strategies with improved situational awareness of road inundation likelihood as an extreme weather event unfolds.

The safe transit of people and goods during a flood event requires fast and reliable access to flood depth information with spatial granularity comparable to the road network. In this research, we propose to use crowdsourced photos of submerged traffic signs for street-level flood depth estimation and mapping. To this end, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to detect traffic signs in user-contributed photos, followed by comparing the lengths of the visible part of detected sign poles before and after the flood event. A tilt correction approach is also designed and implemented to rectify potential inaccuracy in pole length estimation caused by tilted stop signs in floodwaters. The mean absolute error (MAE) achieved for pole length estimation in pre- and post-flood photos is 1.723 and 2.846 in., respectively, leading to an MAE of 4.710 in. for flood depth estimation. The presented approach provides people and first responders with a reliable and geographically scalable solution for estimating and communicating real-time flood depth data at their locations.

Due to complexity and ferocity of severe flooding, predicting flood-prone areas is a difficult task. Thus, creating flood susceptibility maps at local level is though challenging but an inevitable task. In order to implement a flood management plan for the Balrampur district, an agricultural dominant landscape of India, and strengthen its resilience, flood susceptibility modeling and mapping are carried out. In the present study, three hybrid machine learning (ML) models, namely, fuzzy-ANN (artificial neural network), fuzzy-RBF (radial basis function), and fuzzy-SVM (support vector machine) with 12 topographic, hydrological, and other flood influencing factors were used to determine flood-susceptible zones. To ascertain the relationship between the occurrences and flood influencing factors, correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) and multicollinearity diagnostic tests were used. The predictive power of these models was validated and compared using a variety of statistical techniques, including Wilcoxon signed-rank, t-paired tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results show that fuzzy-RBF model outperformed other hybrid ML models for modeling flood susceptibility, followed by fuzzy-ANN and fuzzy-SVM. Overall, these models have shown promise in identifying flood-prone areas in the basin and other basins around the world. The outcomes of the work would benefit policymakers and government bodies to capture the flood-affected areas for necessary planning, action, and implementation.

A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model is conducted, comparing it with state-of-the-art models across various fusion configurations of Multispectral Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The proposed model consistently outperforms other models across both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, achieving an Intersection Over Union (IOU) of 0.5862 and 0.7031, respectively.

This research investigates the hazards of landslides and floods in two adopted basins in the Yamaguchi and Shimane prefectures, Japan. This study utilized ten environmental variables alongside categories representing landslide-prone, non-landslide, flooded, and non-flooded areas. Employing a machine-learning approach, namely, a LASSO regression model, we generated Landslide Hazard Maps (LHM), Flood Hazard Maps (FHM), and a Composite Hazard Map (CHM). The LHM identified flood-prone low-lying areas in the northwest and southeast, while central and northwest regions exhibited higher landslide susceptibility. Both LHM and FHM were classified into five hazard levels. Landslide hazards predominantly covered high- to moderate-risk areas, since the high-risk areas constituted 38.8% of the study region. Conversely, flood hazards were mostly low to moderate, with high- and very high-risk areas at 10.49% of the entire study area. The integration of LHM and FHM into CHM emphasized high-risk regions, underscoring the importance of tailored mitigation strategies. The accuracy of the model was assessed by employing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve method, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were determined. The LHM and FHM exhibited an exceptional AUC of 99.36% and 99.06%, respectively, signifying the robust efficacy of the model. The novelty in this study is the generation of an integrated representation of both landslide and flood hazards. Finally, the produced hazard maps are essential for policymaking to address vulnerabilities to landslides and floods.

Given the climate change impacts on floodplain aquatic habitats, further studies are needed to understand and quantify the riverâlake connectivity and its temporal dynamics. However, few studies are dedicated to objectively estimating hydrological connectivity, and new commercial satellite datasets and machine learning approaches can advance the understanding of this important topic. This paper proposes a new framework for computing the hydrological connectivity of small floodplain lakes (river-Lake CONNECTivity or L-CONNECT) in the Amazon JuruÃ¡ River. The L-CONNECT framework consists of spectral similarity analysis with machine learning in the riverâlake system and three steps were implemented: (i) sampling process based on independent satellite-imagery visual interpretation; (ii) automated similarity features extraction from river-lake system; and (iii) training and validation of machine learning algorithm. A total of 552 3-m PlanetScope SuperDove imagery were acquired in 2020 and 2021 to perform our approach. In general, the L-CONNECT framework achieved 88% overall accuracy. However, not-connected lakes were not easily estimated. We found that the L-CONNECT framework managed to perform accurately over all lakes investigated independent on their distance to JuruÃ¡ River channel (average accuracy of â¼ 86%), and that there was a low discordance (less than 30%) between the lakesâ hydrological connectivity responses acquired by Sentinel-2 against PlanetScope data. The mapping results showed that lakes were more connected to the JuruÃ¡ River during the 2021 (not-connected lakes rate of 28%) compared to 2020, which was explained by higher cumulative precipitation during January, February, and March of 2021. Finally, the new L-CONNECT framework proposed here can support hydrological connectivity mapping of small floodplain lakes by considering assumptions relative to the similarity between river and water spectra as a proxy for that.

As a result, it is vital to determine the extent and type of land cover in flooded areas quickly and accurately in order to facilitate disaster relief and mitigation efforts. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an all-weather, 24 h data source used to extract information about flood inundations, and its primary aim is to extract water body information for flood monitoring. In this study, we have studied the backscattering characteristics of water and non-water, combined the threshold segmentation method with Markov random fields (MRF), and embedded simulated annealing (SA) in the process of image noise reduction, resulting in the development of a water extraction method KI-MRF-SA with high accuracy in classification and high automation. Furthermore, object-scale adaptive convolutional neural networks (OSA-CNN) are introduced for the classification of optical images before the flood in order to provide reference data for flood inundation analysis. The method proposed in this study consists of the following three steps: (1) The Kittler and Illingworth (KI) thresholding algorithm is used for the segmentation of SAR images in order to determine the initial flood inundation extent; (2) MRF and SA algorithms are employed as a means to optimize the initial flood inundation extent, and the results are combined across multiple polarizations by using an intersection operation to determine the final flood inundation extent; and (3) As part of the flood mapping process, land cover types before the flood are classified using OSA-CNN and combined with flood inundation extents. According to the experimental results, it is evident that the proposed KI-MRF-SA method is capable of distinguishing water from non-water with significantly higher accuracy (3â5% improvement in the overall accuracy) than conventional thresholding methods. Combined with the classification method of OSA-CNN proposed in our earlier research, the overall classification accuracy of flood-affected areas could reach 92.7%.

Extensive up-to-date field samples are required for calibrating methods (e.g., machine learning) and validating results (e.g., maps). The purpose of this study is to design a dataset generation approach that extracts training data from already existing wetland maps in an unsupervised manner. The proposed method utilizes the LandTrendr algorithm to identify areas least likely to have changed over a seven-year period from 2016 to 2022 in Minnesota, USA. Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data were used through Google Earth Engine (GEE), and sub-pixel water fraction (SWF) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were considered as wetland indicators. A simple thresholding approach was applied to the magnitude of change maps to identify pixels with the most negligible change. These samples were then employed to train a random forest (RF) classifier in an object-based image analysis framework. The proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 89% with F1 scores of 91%, 81%, 88%, and 72% for water, emergent, forested, and scrub-shrub wetland classes, respectively. The proposed method offers an accurate and cost-efficient method for updating wetland inventories as well as studying areas impacted by floods on state or even national scales.

However, the distribution of visible tsunami deposits does not cover the entire extent of past tsunami inundation. A method for the identification of inundation traces that are macroscopically invisible is required for the accurate reconstruction of the extent of paleo-tsunami inundation. Here, we propose a composite method to recognize tsunami deposits based on mineral particles with high preservation potential. This method is based on multiple proxies, including non-destructive methods such as X-ray computed tomography and X-ray fluorescence scans, and mineralogical and grain size analyses. The method was applied to the paleo-tsunami deposits distributed in Erimo, southern Hokkaido, Japan. Scanning electron microscopy and electron-probe micro-analyzer mapping enable the detection of macroscopically invisible particles. A detailed chemical comparison with the host rocks of the hinterlands revealed that the macroscopically invisible particles share a common source with observable tsunami sand. Their grain size distribution measured using image analysis was compared with that of the observable tsunami sand layer. To verify the inundation area suggested by the macroscopically invisible tsunami sand, we predicted the inundation extent of the paleo-tsunami using the Framework of Inversion of Tsunami deposits considering Transport of Nonuniform Unsteady Suspension and Sediment entrainment Deep Neural Network (FITTNUSS-DNN), a deep-learning inverse model that reconstructs tsunami characteristics from the features of visible tsunami deposits. The maximum extent of inundation predicted using FITTNUSS-DNN was comparable to the distribution of the macroscopically invisible sand, indicating that detecting the invisible sand layer can effectively estimate the inundation extent by paleo-tsunamis.

In the near future, estimated flood intensity and frequency are projected to increase. In this context, automatic and accurate satellite-derived flood maps are key for fast emergency response and damage assessment. However, current approaches for operational flood mapping present limitations due to cloud coverage on acquired satellite images, the accuracy of flood detection, and the generalization of methods across different geographies. In this work, a machine learning framework for operational flood mapping from optical satellite images addressing these problems is presented. It is based on a clouds-aware segmentation model trained in an extended version of the WorldFloods dataset. The model produces accurate and fast water segmentation masks even in areas covered by semitransparent clouds, increasing the coverage for emergency response scenarios. The proposed approach can be applied to both Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 data, which enables a much higher revisit of the damaged region, also key for operational purposes. Detection accuracy and generalization of proposed model is carefully evaluated in a novel global dataset composed of manually labeled flood maps.

These changes have led to a rise in the occurrence of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), causing substantial socio-economic damages. Therefore, monitoring and studying these glacial lakes is imperative to comprehend the impacts of climate change on the cryosphere. Automatic and Semi-automatic methods for mapping glacial lakes from remote sensing satellite data have been developed and extensively used in mapping and monitoring glacial lakes. Artificial intelligence (AI) based machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been successfully used for feature extraction and image segmentation in recent years. Fully convolutional neural (FCN) networks-based U-Net architecture, which involves a gradual integration of superficial visual characteristics and semantic information extracted from images to segment small objects effectively, is used in the present study to extract glacial lakes pixel-by-pixel from satellite data, providing a more efficient and accurate method for identifying and mapping these lakes. The Landsat and Indian Remote Sensing imagery were utilized to train, test and map glacial lakes in the Chandra-Bhaga basin of Himachal Pradesh in North Western Indian Himalaya. A total of 134 glacial lakes were mapped in the basin for 2021, covering approximately 4 km2 area, yielding an aggregate accuracy score of 0.90 with a recall of 0.95, an F1-score of 0.96, and an intersection over union (IoU) value of 0.94. The digital elevation model (DEM) was used to remove the mountain shadows identified and extracted as false glacial lakes during the post-processing phase. The mapped glacial lakes were verified and validated using high-resolution satellite imagery from Google Earth Pro.

As they strictly depend on the accuracy of the input DEMs and reference flood hazard maps used for training, DEM-based flood hazard models may display severe inconsistencies. Our study shows the application of two advanced DEM-based models to a large study area, and presents two main innovative points. First, the delicate tasks of appropriately selecting the input DEM and flood hazard map are specifically addressed with newly defined methods. Second, the ability of DEM-based models to exploit their natural features to enhance flood hazard mapping over the study region is investigated. Our results show (a) the benefits of considering multiple geomorphic descriptors, (b) the potential of DEM-based models for completing the information of imperfect reference flood hazard maps, and (c) the advantages of continuous representation of hazard over binary flood maps.

Cities like Nagpur, which are newly prone to disasters, need to identify flood-prone areas for planning city development and mitigation measures. Developing countries lack data to generate susceptibility maps, thus remote sensing (RS) and GIS have been used in this study. Ten flood-causing parameters namely altitude, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI), landuse/landcover (LULC), soil texture, rainfall, surface runoff, distance from river, lithology and landforms, have been mapped for Nagpur on ArcGIS10.8 using freely available data. The frequency ratio (FR) model has been adopted, with 70% of flood locations used for machine learning and the remaining 30% for validation. Parameters of surface runoff (FR up to 4.30), landform (FR up to 3.58), lithology (FR up to 2.36), and high rainfall (FR up to 1.82) have shown a maximum positive relationship with the flood-prone areas. The results having 80.90% accuracy and validation of 81.58%. proved that the selected parameters can be robustly adopted for mapping flood susceptible areas.

Simultaneously, the northern coastal area of Pekalongan, located adjacent to the Java Sea, has been affected by coastal floods due to sea level rise. The flood conditions in this area were exacerbated by land subsidence, leading to coastal inundation. Monitoring land subsidence in Pekalongan has become essential in predicting other possible land subsidence occurrence areas and mitigating the possible hazards caused by land subsidence. The analysis of land subsidence has been much easier since the introduction of radar satellites. In this study, 124 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets from the Sentinel-1 radar satellite between 2017 and 2022 in descending tracks were used. The data were processed through a time-series interferometry SAR (InSAR) method based on the improved combined scatterers interferometry with optimized point scatterers (ICOPS) algorithm to provide accurate measurements over large areas by improving the selection of measurement points (MPs) from persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) points using a deep learning algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), and the resulting optimized MPs were then spatially clustered using optimized hot spot analysis (OHSA) to estimate significant points statistically and define them as hot spot points. The results of time-series deformation in Pekalongan were compared with the GPS station measurements. From the comparison, a good correlation in terms of deformation patterns between time-series InSAR and GPS measurements was observed. Our study revealed that land subsidence in Pekalongan has occurred mostly in settlement areas under the young alluvium soil, which cannot support many buildings' maximum compression. Another cause of land subsidence in Pekalongan is excessive groundwater extraction in settlement areas. Thus, compaction in the aquifer areas may occur as a result of the reduced effective stress of the pore pressure. Further analysis of this study would involve monitoring groundwater activity using data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite and comparing them with weather station data. The analysis of the two datasets aims to understand the relationships between groundwater storage data and the monthly precipitation in Pekalongan. Finally, the potential outcomes of land subsidence in Pekalongan will be assessed using the geographic information system (GIS) method based on susceptibility mapping.

The park, located in the estuaries of the Brahmani, Baitarani, Dharma, and Mahanadi river systems, is home to Indiaâs second-largest mangrove environment and the worldâs most active and diverse saline wetland. To evaluate its vulnerability and risk, various threats were considered, with a focus on floods. Satellite imageries, such as Landsat 8 OLI, SRTM digital elevation model, open street map, Google pro image, reference map, field survey, and other ancillary data, were utilized to develop vulnerability and risk indicators. These indicators were then reclassified into âCostâ and âBenefitâ categories for better understanding. The factors were standardized using the max-min standardization method before being fed into the vulnerability and risk model. Initially, an analytical hierarchy approach was used to develop the model, which was later compared with machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM) and uncertainty analysis indices (e.g., overall accuracy, kappa, map quality, etc.). The results showed that the SVM-RBF machine learning algorithm outperformed the traditional geostatistical model (AHP), with an overall accuracy of 99.54% for flood risk mapping compared to AHPâs 91.12%. The final output reveals that a large area of Bhitarkanika National park falls under high flood risk zone. The Eastern coastal regions of Govindapur, Kanhupur, Chinchri, Gobardhanpur and Barunei fall under high risk zone of tidal floods, The Northern and western regions of Ramachandrapur, Jaganathpur, Kamalpur, Subarnapur, Paramanandapur, etc., Fall under high risk region of riverine floods. The study also revealed that the areas covered with mangroves have a higher elevation and hence are repellent to any kind of flood. In the event of a flood high priority conservation measures should be taken along all high flood risk areas.

Flood indexing and forecasting are nonetheless complex because multiple external parameters influence flooding. Accordingly, this study explores the potential of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including clustering and neural networks, to develop a flooding susceptibility index (namely, NeuralFlood) that considers multiple factors that are not generally considered otherwise. By comparing four different sub-indices, we aim to create a comprehensive index that captures unique characteristics not found in existing methods. The use of clustering algorithms, model tuning, and multiple neural layers produced insightful outcomes for county-level data. Overall, the four sub-indices' models yielded accurate results for lower classes (accuracy of 0.87), but higher classes had reduced true positive rates (overall average accuracy of 0.68 for all classes).

Impervious surface indices and green space assessments are widely used in land use and urban planning to evaluate the urban environment. Local governments also rely on impervious surface mapping to calculate stormwater fees and effectively manage stormwater runoff. However, accurately determining the size of impervious surfaces is a significant challenge. This study proposes the use of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) method, a pattern recognition approach that is increasingly used in solving engineering problems, to classify impervious surfaces. The research results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SVM method in accurately estimating impervious surfaces, as evidenced by a high overall accuracy of over 90% (indicated by the Cohenâs Kappa coefficient). A case study of the âParkowo-LeÅneâ housing estate in Warsaw, which covers an area of 200,000 m2, shows the successful application of the method. In practice, the remote sensing imagery and SVM method allowed accurate calculation of the area of the surface classes studied. The permeable surface represented about 67.4% of the total complex and the impervious surface corresponded to the remaining 32.6%. These results have implications for stormwater management, pollutant control, flood control, emergency management, and the establishment of stormwater fees for individual properties. The use of remote sensing data and the SVM method provides a valuable approach for mapping impervious surfaces and improving urban land use management. Â© 2023.

The present work aims to develop new toolboxes and enhance an existing methodology by developing spatial analysis tools within a geographic information system (GIS) environment to allocate large-scale NBSs based on a multi-criteria algorithm.

As the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) enables all-time monitoring regardless of bad weather conditions, it fits far better than passive optical sensors to delineate submerged areas during flood events. However, the universal, rapid, and accurate detection of flood extent remains a challenge. Drawing inspiration from the analysis of time-series variation in representative ground objects caused by flood events, as observed in a dual-polarized SAR time series over a hydrological year, we construct a novel window-based variation model. This model can be used to capture both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations of flood features across different polarization modes. Subsequently, we introduce an unsupervised flood-mapping framework that integrates spatiotemporal flood features extracted by fuzzy-based methods. Given the distinct backscatter value of short vegetation, a flooded short vegetation (FSV) activation model is designed and performed to enhance flood-mapping accuracy in complex regions. The proposed method, tested on the 2020 East Dongting Lake flood in China, surpasses three unsupervised flood-mapping methods and two deep-learning methods in terms of quantitative evaluation and visual performance. The uncertainty of our proposed framework is tested through parameter sensitivity analyses, comparisons with flood-mapping results from other sensor images, and extensive experiments on floods at different locations and times, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness, stability, and universality.

In this paper, we focus on fusing multi-temporal, multi-spectral images where data acquired from different instruments with different spatial resolutions is used. We leverage the spatial relationship between images at multiple modalities to generate high-resolution image sequences at higher revisiting rates. To achieve this goal, we formulate the fusion method as a recursive state estimation problem and study its performance in filtering and smoothing contexts. Furthermore, a calibration strategy is proposed to estimate the time-varying temporal dynamics of the image sequence using only a small amount of historical image data. Differently from the training process in traditional machine learning algorithms, which usually require large datasets and computation times, the parameters of the temporal dynamical model are calibrated based on an analytical expression that uses only two of the images in the historical dataset. A distributed version of the Bayesian filtering and smoothing strategies is also proposed to reduce its computational complexity. To evaluate the proposed methodology we consider a water mapping task where real data acquired by the Landsat and MODIS instruments are fused generating high spatialâtemporal resolution image estimates. Our experiments show that the proposed methodology outperforms the competing methods in both estimation accuracy and water mapping tasks.

In this study, spatiotemporal variations of water resources variables, namely precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff (R), regarded as water input, output, and storage, respectively, were systematically statistically analyzed. Following this, a comprehensive Copula-based Drought/Flood Index (CDFI) was constructed to identify the drought/flood hazards, and machine learning and game theory were then successively applied to quantify the influence of the Large-scale Climate Indices (LCIs) on drought/flood intensity. The results reveal that temporally, P, ET, and R present similar turning-point years in the 1990s, with values changing from significantly decreasing to insignificantly decreasing, significantly increasing, and insignificantly decreasing, respectively. Spatially, the water resources become drier in the arid area and wetter in the humid area. The CDFI results demonstrate an increased flood probability in the mountains and near-polar rivers, and drought in extremely arid areas. Moreover, the influencing factors of CDFI exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity. CDFI is controlled by the Arctic Oscillation in most regions of the world, and the influence of sea surface temperature on CDFI increases gradually with the decrease of latitude, and extreme events are generally linked to extreme LCIs. Notably, vegetation change (area, type, and growth) affects ET and R, thus enhancing the climateâs impact on drought/flood hazards. The conclusions provide an essential basis for the identification and policy planning of drought/flood hazards caused by the spatiotemporal variations of water resource variables.

Nine continuous and categorical variables that reflect the conditions that influence flood probabilitiesâslope, elevation, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), distance to river, land use, lithology, rainfall, and valley depthâwere used to prepare flood-probability maps of a catchment in western Isfahan Province, Iran. To train the five algorithms, 108 flood events were mapped in the catchment, and these locations were randomly separated into two subsets at a ratio of 70:30. The data (comprised of the nine flood-conditioning variables) for the larger portion (70% of cases) were used to build the models and the remaining 30% of cases were used to test them. The performances of the models were evaluated with several statistical and error tests (TP, TN, FP, FN, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results show that the hybrid (ensemble) methods boosted accuracy performance above the standalone REPT by between 2.56 and 15.38%.

In this study, we investigated the uses of the Bayesian optimization algorithm for hyper-parameter searches of two classifiers, namely LightGBM and XGBoost. The models were verified with a dataset from Vietnam, including historical flood locations from satellite images and survey data, and 11 features from three groups, namely physical, hydrological, and human-related factors. The models' performance was evaluated using Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (AUC-ROC). Several strategies were applied to avoid over-fitting, and the results show that two tuned Gradient boosters reached considerably high AUC values (approximately 0.98) compared with the previous study with a similar dataset. The model interpretation was also implemented using the Shapley (SHAP) values to understand better how models work and the interactions between features. The search for optimal hyper-parameters is worth investigating in the future, particularly when there is growing work for novel optimization algorithms. The verification of such an approach is scientifically sound, and the models can be used as an alternative solution for natural hazard analysis in countries prone to hazards.

However, accurate identification and mapping of GLs in the background of snow-clad mountains through visual interpretation of satellite data is a tedious and challenging assignment when multiyear time-series analysis is considered. To overcome this challenge, automated extraction of GLs in satellite images has been carried out in this study with the help of machine learning (ML). The novelty of this study is identification and tracking of GLs over three decades using ML and geospatial analysis using pixel-based image classification. For this, Random Forest Classifier (RFC) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were employed. The methodology is demonstrated here for the identification and mapping of GLs in the Sikkim Himalaya from 1987 to 2020 and for forecasting the possible fate of these GLs through time-series modelling. The geospatial time-series analysis using Google Earth Engine, ML classifiers, and GIS framework, has captured the dynamics of GLs in Sikkim and has revealed the spatial and temporal patterns in GLsâ dimensions as well as GLOF risk.

When these events strike, automated tools using remote sensing for quick mapping of the affected areas are critical for planning rescue activities and assessing impact. The most recent techniques to map floods are based on semantic segmentation and deep learning, which require large datasets and ground truth for training, which are difficult to get. To overcome this challenge, we propose an effective method for synthesizing patches of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images containing open-land flooded areas. With bitemporal image acquisitions, we replace portions of land areas in the second acquisition with water pixels borrowed from permanent water bodies. Spatial patterns derived from elevation data help guide the process. With this approach, we build a large dataset with pre- and post-event Sentinel-1-based VH-polarized radar intensity images to train deep neural networks to map real-life floods. In a case study, we use an established U-Net architecture and show that a model version with less than 2% of the number of original parameters achieves almost identical flood detection accuracy. This allows for faster processing and is a clear advantage from an operational perspective. For comparison, we provide empirical segmentation results of four flood cases. F1 scores agree between 0.80 and 0.90 when compared with reference flood maps from the Copernicus service. This confirms that the approach is valuable for mapping areas affected by floods, e.g., during or immediately after catastrophic events, even in areas that were not included during model training.

The objective of this study was to quantify the hazard posed by the occurrence of a GLOF due to an ice avalanche into an ice-free moraine-dammed lake, producing a surge wave and raising the water level. This study was carried out in the Himalayan region and in the western cordillera of North America. Some simplifications and combinations of parameters were made to reduce the number of parameters as much as possible. We selected seven factors for the quantitative susceptibility assessment of the GLOF hazard: the dangerous glacier slope factor S, temperature factor T, aspect factor Y, glacier aspect factor X, runout factor of the dangerous glacier R, ratio of the volume factor of the dangerous glacier to the volume of the lake V, and the downstream slope factor of the dam D (lake parameter). A machine learning model (a support vector machine, SVM) was used to create a susceptibility assessment model. Data for 21 drained and 50 undrained ice-free moraine-dammed lakes in the Himalayan region were used for the training of the GLOF susceptibility assessment model. In addition, data for 19 drained and 43 undrained ice-free moraine-dammed lakes in the western cordillera of North America were used to test the GLOF susceptibility assessment model. The susceptibility assessment factor P1 is a combination of these seven factors. The probability of GLOF occurrence increases as the P1 value increases. Using three critical P1 values, we divided the GLOF occurrence probability into four grades: low, medium, high, and very high probability of occurrence. The threshold values for the western cordillera of North America were 6.1â15.4% lower than the corresponding critical values for the Himalayan region because the annual temperature variation is larger in Canada than in Tibet. Thus, this assessment model can be used to assess the susceptibility of other areas of the world to GLOFs when annual temperature variations are considered.

With high computational efficiency, machine learning models are increasingly used for flood susceptibility mapping. However, limited flooded or nonflooded samples constrain modelsâ predictive capability and introduce uncertainty in feature engineering. This study introduces a semi-supervised graph-structured model, Graph Attention Network (GAT), to address data scarcity and enable the use of only basic flood conditioning factors as inputs. GAT uses nodes and edges to represent spatial units and their relative spatial relationships. Based on its graph structure and attention mechanism, GAT automatically extracts high-order features from inputs of labeled and unlabeled units for modeling. In the metropolitan area of Dalian, China, GAT outperformed other models in flooded-nonflooded sample classification and exhibited a rational flood susceptibility distribution pattern, with only four basic flood conditioning factors and less than 1.2% of units for training.

The rational use of reservoir operation scheme can not only enhance the capacity of flood control and disaster reduction in the basin, but also improve the efficiency of water use and give full play to the comprehensive role the reservoir. The conventional decision-making method of reservoir operation scheme is computationally large, subjectivity and difficult to capture the nonlinear relationship. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a reservoir operation scheme decision-making model IWGAN-IWOA-CNN based on artificial intelligence and deep learning technology. In view of the lack of data in the original reservoir operation scheme and the limited improvement of data characteristics by the traditional data augmentation algorithm, an improved generative adversarial network algorithm (IWGAN) is proposed. IWGAN uses the loss function which integrates Wasserstein distance, gradient penalty and difference item, and dynamically adds random noise in the process of model training. The whale optimization algorithm is improved by introducing Logistic chaotic mapping to initialize population, non-linear convergence factor and adaptive weights, and Levy flight perturbation strategy. The improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA) is used to optimize hyperparameters of convolutional neural networks (CNN), so as to obtain the best parameters for model prediction. The experimental results show that the data generated by IWGAN has certain representation ability and high quality; IWOA has faster convergence speed, higher convergence accuracy and better stability; IWGAN-IWOA-CNN model has higher prediction accuracy and reliability of scheme selection.

Finally, the area of damage to urban land cover and various agricultural lands has been estimated consecutively during the flood period.

Hyperspectral imaging is widely utilized in identifying and classifying objects on the ground surface for various agriculture application uses such as crop mapping, flood management, identifying crops damaged due to flood/drought, etc. Hyperspectral imaging-based crop classification is a very challenging task because of spectral dimensions and poor spatial feature representation. Designing efficient feature extraction and dimension reduction techniques can address high dimensionality problems. Nonetheless, achieving good classification accuracies with minimal computation overhead is a challenging task in Hyperspectral imaging-based crop classification. In meeting research challenges, this work presents Hyperspectral imaging-based crop classification using soft-margin decision boundary optimization (SMDBO) based Support Vector Machine (SVM) along with Image Fusion-Recursive Filter (IFRF) and Inherent Feature Extraction (IFE). In this work, IFRF is used for reducing spectral features with meaningful representation. Then, IFE is used for differentiating physical properties and shading elements of different objects spatially. Both spectral and spatial features extracted are trained using SMDBO-SVM for performing hyperspectral object classification. Using SMDBO-SVM for Hyperspectral object classification aid in addressing class imbalance issues; thus, the proposed IFE-SMDBO-SVM model achieves better accuracies and with minimal misclassification in comparison with state-of-art statistical and Deep Learning (DL) based Hyperspectral object classification model using standard dataset Indian Pines and Pavia University.

Remote sensing has been an effective tool for interpreting and analyzing water bodies and detecting floods over the past decades. In recent years, deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated promising performance for remote sensing image classification for many applications, including inundation mapping. Unlike conventional algorithms, deep learning can learn features automatically from large datasets. This research aims to compare and investigate the performance of two state-of-the-art methods for 3D inundation mapping: a deep learning-based image analysis and a Geomorphic Flood Index (GFI). The first method, deep learning image analysis involves three steps: 1) image classification to delineate flood boundaries, 2) integrate the flood boundaries and topography data to create a three-dimensional (3D) water surface, and 3) compare the 3D water surface with pre-flood topography to estimate floodwater depth. The second method, i.e., GFI, involves three phases: 1) calculate a river basin morphological information, such as river height (hr) and elevation difference (H), 2) calibrate and measure GFI to delineate flood boundaries, and 3) calculate the coefficient parameter (& alpha;), and correct the value of hr to estimate inundation depth. The methods were implemented to generate 3D inundation maps over Princeville, North Carolina, United States during hurricane Matthew in 2016. The deep learning method demonstrated better performance with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.26 m for water depth. It also achieved about 98% in delineating the flood boundaries using UAV imagery.

This paper uses a modified version of GlacierNet2 to study the feasibility and effectiveness of large-scale glacier mapping in Nepal Himalaya, Karakoram, and parts of western Himalaya. Also, we propose a large-scale mapping strategy to progressively enhance the network familiarity to varied types of glaciers via systematically repeating the training process. This strategy allows the network to delineate a large number of glaciers while only requiring a small proportion of initial training data. Thus, resulting in a significant drop in labor and expert intervention, which are required for selecting and labeling the training data. Our results show a successful and accurate generation of glacier boundaries with an intersection over union (IOU) score of 0.8115 in the Karakoram and parts of western Himalaya and an IOU of 0.7525 in the Nepal Himalaya. Our work outlines how future efforts of large and global scale mapping can be developed to monitor and analyze glacier dynamics.",IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/access.2022.3188795,0,0,No,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, standard flood detection results are inaccurate for complex phenomena and cannot handle enormous quantities of data. In order to overcome those drawbacks and enhance the outcomes of conventional flood detection models, deep learning techniques are extensively used in flood control. Therefore, a novel deep hybrid model for flood prediction (DHMFP) with a combined Harris hawks shuffled shepherd optimization (CHHSSO)-based training algorithm is introduced for flood prediction. Initially, the input satellite image is preprocessed by the median filtering method. Then the preprocessed image is segmented using the cubic chaotic map weighted based k-means clustering algorithm. After that, based on the segmented image, features like difference vegetation index (DVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified transformed vegetation index (MTVI), green vegetation index (GVI), and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) are extracted. The features are subjected to a hybrid model for predicting floods based on the extracted feature set. The hybrid model includes models like CNN (convolutional neural network) and deep ResNet classifiers. Also, to enhance the prediction performance, the CNN and deep ResNet models are fine-tuned by selecting the optimal weights by the combined Harris hawks shuffled shepherd optimization (CHHSSO) algorithm during the training process. This hybrid approach decreases the number of errors while improving the efficacy of deep neural networks with additional neural layers.

Identifying resilience metrics remains challenging, mainly because the concept is relatively new, methodological approaches are almost absent, and many types of resilience-related data are still unavailable. A number of indices for flood resilience have been introduced in the literature, typically based on clustering algorithms that allow complex behaviors to be mapped to specific levels of resilience. Consequently, the qualitative aspects of such indices are highly sensitive to the availability, quality and heterogeneity of data. Historically, this assessment has often been performed using rather simple algorithms such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Whilst they allow reliable resilience metrics in some areas, their use in a complex urban system such as the northern coastal area in Morocco is arguable. In the present study, we introduce an advanced Machine Learning (ML) method, namely the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to build a Flood Resilience Index (FRI). Compared to classical methodologies, this present technique allows an improved assimilation of the complex relationship between data representing the social, economic and physical status of the area and resilience level. The success of this approach is mainly due to the ability of SOM to deal with complex, heterogeneous and sparse datasets.

The current research has proposed a novel approach for Flood Hazard (FH) prediction using hybrid Machine Learning (ML) models that integrate ensemble ML models with several Feature Selection (FS) algorithms. An optimum set of Flood Influential Factors (FIFs) was determined using the Simulated Annealing (SA) and Information Gain (IG) FS algorithms. The ensemble ML models employed include AdaboostM1 (ABM), Boosted Generalized Linear Model (BGLM), and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) algorithms. In addition, the hyper-parameters of the hybrid models were optimized using the random search (RS) method and repeated crossvalidation technique. The proposed hybrid models were trained using flood inventory map and FIFs obtained from a spatial database. The results verified that the SA and IG algorithms detect 9 and 13 factors as FIFs in the FH assessment, respectively. Moreover, rainfall, distance to river, altitude, and lithology FIFs have a greater impact than the other factors in the Sardabroud watershed, Mazandaran Province, Iran.

We propose a multi-hazards risk assessment method which considers social vulnerability into the analyzing and utilize machine learning-enabled models to solve this issue. The proposed methodology integrates three aspects as follows: (1) characterization and mapping of multi-hazards (Flooding, Wildfires, and Seismic) using five machine learning methods including Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and K-Means (KM); (2) evaluation of social vulnerability with a composite index tailored for the case-study area and using machine learning models for classification; (3) risk-based quantification of spatial interaction mechanisms between multi-hazards and social vulnerability. The results indicate that RF model performs best in both hazard-related and social vulnerability datasets.

Additionally, high multi-hazards level and socially vulnerable cities account for 15.88% (covering 4.92% land). This study generates a multi-hazards risk map which show a wide variety of spatial patterns and a corresponding understanding of where regional high hazards potential and vulnerable areas are.

The input features used were the Digital Elevation Map (DEM), the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) categories, and the slope of each cell. National Wetland Inventory (NWI) categories were then created using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a supervised machine learning technique. The research simulated the effects of a 1.468 m sea-level rise in the study area from 2021 to 2090, considering wetland types, marsh accretion, wave erosion, and surface elevation changes. The largest land cover increases were observed in Estuarine Open Water and Open Ocean, expanding by approximately 106.2 hectares across different sea-level rise scenarios (RCP 8.5_Upper Limit). These gains were counterbalanced by losses of approximately 106.2 hectares in Inland Open Water, Ocean Beaches, Mangroves, Regularly Flooded Marsh, Swamp, Undeveloped, and Developed Dryland. Notably, Estuarine Open Water (97.7 hectares) and Open Ocean (8.5 hectares) experienced the most significant expansion, indicating submergence and saltwater intrusion by 2090 due to sea-level rise.

The airborne Lidar systems, although successful in extracting terrestrial topography, suffer from high vertical uncertainties in coastal wetlands due to tidal effects. This study tests the feasibility of drone Lidar leveraging deep learning of point clouds on 3D marsh mapping. In an ocean-front, pristine estuary dominated by Spartina alterniflora, drone Lidar point clouds, and in-field marsh samples were collected. The RandLA-Net deep learning model was applied to classify the Lidar point cloud to ground, low vegetation, and high vegetation with an overall accuracy of around 0.84. With the extracted digital terrain model and digital surface model, the cm-level bare earth surfaces and marsh heights were mapped. The bare earth terrain reached a vertical accuracy (root-mean-square error, or RMSE) of 5.55 cm. At the 65 marsh samples, the drone Lidar-extracted marsh height was lower than the in-field height measurements. However, their strongly significantly linear relationship (Pearson's r = 0.93) reflects the validity of the drone Lidar for measuring marsh canopy height. The adjusted Lidar-extracted marsh height had an RMSE of 0.12 m.

First, a finite-volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM) and a typhoon model were developed and validated. Then, five scenarios of varying intensity were defined and combined with FVCOM to identify inundation scenarios. Subsequently, machine learning was used to obtain the fine-scale gridded population and gross domestic product (GDP) maps based on the census and geospatial data. Finally, we assessed the magnitude of the affected population and GDP based on the inundation scenarios and refined exposure datasets.

The predictions of the models have been analyzed based on popularly adopted performance evaluation metrics structural similarity index measure (SSIM), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Our proposed autoencoder model outperforms the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) and Conv-LSTM model. We have got comparatively higher scores (average) of SSIM (0.739) and PSNR (64.424) as well as lower scores (average) of RMSE (0.155) and MSE (0.025) for the predictions which signify the ability of our model to learn spatiotemporal features linked with AR-dynamics.",GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE,10.1016/j.gloplacha.2023.104295,0,0,No,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spread of leafy spurge beyond the river channels has yet to be mapped and recorded, and this research was conducted to map leafy spurge occurrence in the Yampa River Valley. Significant stakeholder mapping efforts took place in the summer of 2019-2021, leading to excellent spatial data on leafy spurge presence and absence along the main channel. In summer 2019, multispectral SPOT seven satellite imagery, stakeholder ground mapping efforts, and bright yellow-green leafy spurge bracts were used to interpret imagery, identify dense, unobscured patches of leafy spurge, and digitize them. Spectral signatures from training samples for leafy spurge and other land cover classes (generalized as ""not leafy spurge"") were then used to train a Random Forest machine learning classification. In the summer of 2021, generated classification maps were compared to multispectral satellite imagery and stakeholder ground mapped leafy spurge presence. Mismatches were identified, and 271 validation locations were identified, navigated to, and evaluated for leafy spurge presence. Leafy spurge training samples were classified with 96% accuracy. Correctly classified leafy spurge locations had higher leafy spurge coverage and lower overstory canopy than missed leafy spurge locations. Leafy spurge growing beneath shrub canopy or growing as individual plants along the riverbanks were more likely to be missed. A frequency analysis for other plant species found at validation locations determined that smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.), dandelion (Taraxacum officinale L.), and willow (Salix sp.) were most frequently misclassified as leafy spurge. In conclusion, multispectral satellite imagery was useful at remote detection of leafy spurge in open areas with dense leafy spurge coverage, but more work must be done for identification of sparse and diffuse leafy spurge infestations.",FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING,10.3389/frsen.2023.1086085,0,0,No,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flood is one of these tensions, and to reduce the damages caused by it, it is necessary to identify vulnerable areas. This study aims is to evaluate the resilience of flood-prone sub-watersheds in the Beshar basin the Kohgiluyeh-Boyerahmad province of Iran. For this purpose, flood risk areas were determined using three machine learning models (MLMs), including random forest (RF), generalized linear model (GLM), and artificial neural network (ANN). Three models were evalu-ated based on criteria such as the ROC curve and Kappa coefficient, and the most accurate model was selected to identify areas at risk and complete the resilience questionnaire by residents. So-cial, economic, policy, and infrastructure criteria and 24 important and influential items were used to measure resilience. Different statistical methods were used to analyze the questionnaires and determine the resilience of different sub-basins. The results showed that the RF model (AUC = 0.96) is more accurate than the other two models. The flood risk map also showed that the very low-risk class had the largest area (2722 km2, 86% of the total study area). Also, the re-silience results showed a decrease in the mean resilience scores after 2006 compared to before 2006. The results of the spatial changes of the resilience of different sub-watersheds in these two periods showed that in the first period, 4, 9, 13, and 16 sub-watersheds are in the low resilience class and, 10 and 17 sub-watersheds are in the high resilience class. Also; after 2006, 3, 4, 9, and 21 sub-watersheds were placed in the low resilience class and 10, 13, and 14 sub-watersheds were in the high resilience class, which has had changes compared to the previous period.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.103910,0,0,Yes,Iran,"RF,GLM,ANN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Driftwood has always been regarded as a precious asset that enables ecoscientists to track earthquakes. In the event of a typhoon or heavy rain, the surface water flows to flush the woods from the hills to the coast. More specifically, a large rainfall or earthquake may cause floods and collapses, and the trees in the forest will be washed down. Therefore, this study used high-resolution images to build an image database of the new north coast of Taiwan, and a deep learning approach is incorporated to classify the driftwoods. To improve the interpretation of driftwood in the remote images, we initially import eight pieces of textured information which are employed to the raw bands (B, G, R, and IR). The usage of spatial information image extraction technology is incorporated into a deep learning analysis using two parallel approaches. The generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to analyze the color images alongside an ancillary image with texture information. Most of the salt-pepper effects are produced by applying a high-resolution thematic map, and an error matrix is generated to compare the differences between them. The raw data (original R + G + B + IR) images, when analyzed using GAN, have about 70% overall classification outcomes. Not all of the driftwood can be detected. By applying the texture information to the parallel approach, the overall accuracy is enhanced to 78%, and about 80% of the driftwood can be recognized.",ENVIRONMENTS,10.3390/environments10100167,0,0,No,Taiwan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper aims to provide a prioritization program based on flood conditions that optimize flood management and improves society's resilience against flood occurrence. Design/methodology/approach The collected database in this paper has been trained by using ML algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN), to create a prioritization program. Furthermore, the administrative measures in two phases of during and after the flood are prioritized by using the AHP method and questionnaires completed by experts and relief workers in flood management. Findings Among the ML algorithms, the SVM method was selected with 91.37% accuracy. The prioritization program provided by the model, which distinguishes it from other existing models, considers five conditions of the flood occurrence to prioritize actions (season, population affected, area affected, damage to houses and human lives lost). Therefore, the model presents a specific plan for each flood with different occurrence conditions. Research limitations/implications The main limitation is the lack of a comprehensive data set to determine the effect of all flood conditions on the prioritization program and the relief activities that have been done in previous flood disasters. Originality/value The originality of this paper is the use of ML methods to prioritize administrative measures during and after the flood and presents a prioritization program based on each flood's conditions. Therefore, through this program, the authority and society can control the adverse impacts of flood more effectively and help to reduce human and financial losses as much as possible.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT,10.1108/ijdrbe-12-2021-0161,0,0,No,Iran,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Precipitation estimation over land and coastal regions is necessary for addressing the high degree of spatial heterogeneity of water availability and demand, and for resolving the extremes that modulate and amplify hazards such as flooding and landslides. Advancements in computation power along with unique high spatiotemporal and spectral resolution data streams from passive meteorological sensors aboard geosynchronous Earth-orbiting (GEO) and low Earth-orbiting (LEO) satellites offer exciting opportunities to retrieve information about surface precipitation phenomena using data-driven machine learning techniques. In this study, the capabilities of U-Net-like architecture are investigated to map instantaneous, summertime surface precipitation intensity at the spatial resolution of 2 km. The calibrated brightness temperature products from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) radiometer are combined with multispectral images (visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands) from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) aboard the GOES-R satellites as main inputs to the U-Net-like precipitation algorithm. Total precipitable water and 2-m temperature from the Global Forecast System (GFS) model are also used as auxiliary inputs to the model. The results show that the U-Net-like algorithm can capture fine-scale patterns and intensity of surface precipitation at high spatial resolution over stratiform and convective precipitation regimes. The evaluations reveal the potential of extracting relevant, high spatial features over complex surface types such as mountainous regions and coastlines. The algorithm allows users to interpret the inputs' importance and can serve as a starting point for further exploration of precipitation systems within the field of hydrometeorology.",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,10.1175/jhm-d-23-0006.1,0,0,No,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deforestation and forest disturbances associated with logging and fires, combined with extreme droughts, warmer air, and surface temperatures, have led to high tree mortality and harmful net carbon emissions in this region. Regional attempts to characterize land cover dynamics in this region focused on one or two anthropogenic drivers (i.e., deforestation and forest degradation). Land cover studies have also used a limited temporal scale (i.e., 10-15 years), focusing mainly on global and country-scale forest change. In this study, we propose a novel approach to characterize and measure land cover dynamics in the Amazon biome. First, we defined 10 fundamental land cover classes: forest, flooded forest, shrubland, natural grassland, pastureland, cropland, outcrop, bare and impervious, wetland, and water. Second, we mapped the land cover based on the compositional abundance of Landsat sub-pixel information that makes up these land cover classes: green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and shade. Third, we processed all Landsat scenes with <50% cloud cover. Then, we applied a step-wise random forest machine learning algorithm and empirical decision rules to classify intra-annual and annual land cover classes between 1985 and 2022. Finally, we estimated the yearly land cover changes in forested and non-forested ecosystems and characterized the major change drivers. In 2022, forest covered 78.6% (331.9 Mha) of the Amazon biome, with 1.4% of secondary regrowth in more than 5 years. Total herbaceous covered 15.6% of the area, with the majority of pastureland (13.5%) and the remaining natural grassland. Water was the third largest land cover class with 2.4%, followed by cropland (1.2%) and shrubland (0.4%), with 89% overall accuracy. Most of the forest changes were driven by pasture and cropland conversion, and there are signs that climate change is the primary driver of the loss of aquatic ecosystems. Existing carbon emission models disregard the types of land cover changes presented in the studies. The twenty first century requires a more encompassing and integrated approach to monitoring anthropogenic and climate changes in the Amazon biome for better mitigation, adaptation, and conservation policies.",FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE,10.3389/ffgc.2023.1294552,0,0,No,Brazil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the interactions of shallow GW and the terrestrial land surface are widely recognized, in-corporating shallow GW into the land surface, climate, and agroecosystem models is not yet possible due to the lack of groundwater data. Groundwater systems are affected by var-ious factors, including climate, land use/land cover, ecosys-tems, GW extractions, and lithology. Although GW wells are the most direct and accurate way of monitoring water table depths at point scales, upscaling GW levels from point scale to areal or regional scale poses significant challenges. Here, we provide high spatiotemporal resolution global maps of the terrestrial land surface areas influenced by shallow GW from mid-2015 to 2021 (a separate NetCDF file for each year) in a 9 km spatial and daily temporal resolution. We derived this data from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission spaceborne soil moisture observations with a temporal resolution of 3 days and approximately 9 km grid resolution. This spatial scale corresponds to SMAP's ""Equal Area Scalable Earth "" (EASE) grids. The central assumption is that the monthly moving average of soil moisture observa-tions and their coefficient of variation are sensitive to shal-low GW regardless of the prevailing climate. We process the Level-2 enhanced passive soil moisture SMAP (SPL2SMP_E) product to detect shallow GW signals. The presence of shal-low GW data is calculated by an ensemble machine learn-ing model, which is trained using simulations from a variably saturated soil moisture flow model (Hydrus-1D). The simula-tions span various climates, soil textures, and lower bound-ary conditions.The spatiotemporal distribution of shallow GW data based on SMAP soil moisture observations is provided for the first time with this dataset. The data are of value in a wide variety of applications. The most direct use is in climate and land sur-face models as lower boundary conditions or as a diagnostic tool to verify model results. Some other applications may in-clude flood risk analyses and regulation, identifying geotech-nical issues such as shallow GW-triggered liquefaction, global food security, ecosystem services, watershed management, crop yield, vegetation health, water storage trends, and track-ing mosquito-borne diseases by identifying wetlands, among other applications.(c) 2023 The Authors.
