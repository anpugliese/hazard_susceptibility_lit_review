The effect of UHI can be described quantitatively by urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). For measuring urban health and ensuring sustainable development, the analysis of LST and UTFVI are receiving boosted attention. This study predicted LULC, seasonal (summer & winter) LST, and UTFVI variations using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) in Cumilla City Corporation (CCC), Bangladesh. Landsat 4â5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellite images were used for 1999, 2009, and 2019 to predict future scenarios for 2029 and 2039. MLAs such as Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods were used to predict the future change in LULC, LST, and UTFVI. The result suggests that, in the year 2029 and 2039, the urban area will likely to be increased by around 8 % and 11 %, where significant decrease will be taken place in green cover by 9 % and 14 %. If the rapid urban growth continues, more than 30 % of the CCC area will likely to be experienced more than 33 Â°C temperature and strongest UTFVI effect in the year 2029 and 2039. In addition, an average 4 Â°C higher LST was recorded in the urban area compared with vegetation cover. In urban construction practice, avoiding concentrated impermeable layers (built-up areas) and increasing green covers, are effective ways of mitigating the effect of UTFVI. This study will contribute in achieving sustainable development and provide useful insights to understand the complex relationship among different elements of urban environments and promotion of city competence.

Although previous studies have shown that urban heat island (UHI) intensity will be easily affected by the landscape pattern of green space, the relationship between the morphological spatial pattern of green space and UHI intensity remains to be discovered. Compared with landscape pattern, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) can reveal more specific details on the configuration and composition of land use. Therefore, this study aims to explore whether the morphological spatial pattern of land use matters to UHI using machine learning methods. Firstly, the morphological characteristics of green space were analyzed based on MSPA. Secondly, the linear associations between UHI intensity and a set of potential influencing factors (including morphological characteristics) were measured according to correlation coefficient. Lastly, the non-linear contribution of the morphological factors to UHI intensity was quantified based on random forest. An empirical case study in a rapidly-urbanized city has revealed the huge influence of morphological characteristics on UHI intensity with benchmark factors considered. The UHI intensity was negatively correlated with the cores, perforations, and loops of green space, but positively correlated with islets. Therefore, a few large core areas would be better than a large number of small islets when the total amount of green space is fixed. In addition, the fragmented patches of green space should be integrated or connected to enhance the cooling capacity. Our findings could offer some insights for UHI mitigation and land use planning, especially when the size of green space cannot be unlimitedly increased. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","School of Geography and Remote Sensing, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, 510006, China",Building and Environment,10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109910,26,26,Yes,RF,China,Yes,UHII,Relationship between UHII and MSPA green areas (shape).

In this study, we developed specific daytime and nighttime multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models to analyze and predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the Urban Heat Island intensity (UHII), using the air temperature (Tair) as the response variable. We profited from the wealth of in situ Tair data and a comprehensive pool of predictors variables â including land cover, population, traffic, urban geometry, weather data and atmospheric vertical indices. Cluster analysis divided the study period into three main groups, each dominated by a combination of weather systems that, in turn, influenced the onset and strength of the UHII. Anticyclonic circulations favored the emergence of the largest UHII (hourly mean of 5.06 Â°C), while cyclonic circulations dampened its development. The MLR models were only able to explain a modest percentage of variance (64 and 34% for daytime and nighttime, respectively), which we interpret as part of their inability to capture key factors controlling Tair. The RF models, on the other hand, performed considerably better, with explanatory power over 96% of the variance for daytime and nighttime conditions, capturing and mapping the fine-scale Tair spatiotemporal variability in both periods and under each cluster condition. The feature importance analysis showed that the meteorological variables and the land cover were the main predictors of the Tair. Urban planners could benefit from these results, using the high-performing RF models as a robust framework for forecasting and mitigating the effects of the UHI.

The urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) can effectively describe any city's UHI (thermal characteristics) effect. This study aims to assess and predict the seasonal (summer and winter) UTFVI scenario to evaluate the thermal characteristics of Sylhet city, Bangladesh. Landsat 4â5 TM and 8 OLI images from 1995 to 2020 were used to assess the previous status of LULC and UTFVI and predict the future changes for 2025 and 2030 using cellular automata and artificial neural network machine learning algorithms. Prediction results indicate a substantial increase in urban built-up areas by 42% and 44% in 2025 and 2035, followed by reductions in green cover (21% and 22%), bare land (20% and 21%) and water bodies (1%). The rapid expansion of built-up areas will lead to 13 km2 and 14 km2 stronger UTFVI zones in the predicted years. The study provides effective strategies for mitigating the UTFVI effects by avoiding dense infrastructural development, increasing plantation and water bodies, rooftop gardening and using white colour roofs in construction. The findings of this study will allow the urban planners, policymakers and local government to ensure an eco-friendly, inclusive and sustainable urban development through functional modification and replacement of the LULC distribution depending on the present and future circumstances.

Yet thorough investigations into how three-dimensional (3D) architectural patterns influence urban thermal conditions collectively and individually are limited. This study bridges this gap by adopting a machine learning method, boosted regression tree (BRT), to analyze the relative influences and marginal effects of 3D urban architecture on land surface temperature (LST). Ten architectural metrics are incorporated to describe the composition and configuration of 3D architectural patterns at a neighborhood scale in the typical megacity of Shanghai. The results show that in summer, the building coverage ratio (BCR), mean architecture height (MAH), mean architecture height standard deviation (AHSD) and mean architecture projection area (MAPA) are the most influential factors, with relative contributions of 39.3%, 16.5%, 12.3% and 10.4%, respectively. The regulation amplitudes (ÎT) of the dominant metrics for the neighborhood average LST temperature are 2.7 Â°C, 0.9 Â°C, 0.6 Â°C, and 0.6 Â°C, respectively. Moreover, with the LST, the BCR exhibits a monotonic positive correlation, the MAH and AHSD show a stepwise negative correlation, and the MAPA shows a combination of positive and negative correlation. It is generally recommended to decrease the development intensity and architectural base area, while increase the building height and roughness to improve the urban thermal conditions at the neighborhood scale. The dominant contributors and related marginal effects are generally consistent across different seasons. These findings can provide quantitative insights for mitigating the LST effects via rational design and management of 3D architectural patterns. Given the distinctive insights provided, the BRT method is recommended for disentangling the relationship between LST and environmental variables in upcoming studies.

Although urbanization leads to great social and economic progress, they may be confronted with other issues, including extra heat and air pollution. Local climate zone (LCZ), a new concept developed for urban heat island research, provides a standard classification system for the urban environment. LCZs are defined by the context of the urban environment; the minimum diameter of an LCZ is expected to be 400-1,000 m so that it can have a valid effect on the urban climate. However, most existing methods (e.g., the WUDAPT method) regard this task as pixel-based classification, neglecting the spatial information. In this study, we argue that LCZ mapping should be considered as a scene classification task to fully exploit the environmental context. Fifteen cities covering 138 million population in three economic regions of China are selected as the study area. Sentinel-2 multispectral data with a 10 m spatial resolution are used to classify LCZs. A deep convolutional neural network composed of residual learning and the Squeeze-andExcitation block, namely the LCZNet, is proposed. We obtained an overall accuracy of 88.61% by using a large image (48x48 corresponding to 480x480 m(2)) as the representation of an LCZ, 7.5% higher than that using a small image representation (10x10) and nearly 20% higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Image sizes from 32x32 to 64x64 were found suitable for LCZ mapping, while a deeper network achieved better classification with larger inputs. Compared with natural classes, urban classes benefited more from a large input size, as it can exploit the environment context of urban areas. The combined use of the training data from all three regions led to the best classification, but the transfer of LCZ models cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the domain shift. More advanced domain adaptation methods should be applied in this application.","[Liu, Shengjie] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shengjie; Shi, Qian] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Xingang Rd West, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China",ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.04.008,75,19,No,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study emphasizes the prediction of LULC, seasonal LST, and urban thermal field variance (UTFVI) over Ahmedabad city, India using multi date Landsat data. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Cellular Automata (CA) model is use to predict the LULC, while the XGB Regression model is used to predict seasonal LST with input data from 2010, 2015, and 2020 to predict future scenarios of 2025 and 2030. The result suggests an addition in the built-up area of about 5.77% and 13.08%, while a deduction in cropland area of about 4.15% and 12.54% is manifest in the year 2025 and 2030, respectively. This excessive urban growth in the study area will cause to face higher LST ranges of greater than 45 Â°C (24.9 km2 in 2025 and 24.2 km2 in 2030) in summer and 35 Â°C (19.9 km2 in 2025 and 43.6 km2 in 2030) in winter. The concentration of higher LST zones is evident in the rural areas than urban areas, witnessing cool urban islands. The predicted LST analysis suggests a dominant occurrence of none UTFVI zone in the city area and the strongest UTFVI zone in the surrounding rural area during both the seasons. An increase in green space area and avoidance of non-impermeable surfaces is suggest in future scenarios to mitigate UHI. Furthermore, the outcome of the research can help urban planners and policymakers while formulating urban heat island related mitigation strategies in the near-future scenario.

A high-spatial-resolution canopy UHI monitoring method would help better understand the urban thermal environment. Taking the city of Nanjing in China as an example, we propose a method for evaluating canopy UHI intensity (CUHII) at high resolution by using remote sensing data and machine learning with a random forest (RF) model. Firstly, the observed environmental parameters, e.g., surface albedo, land use/land cover, impervious surface, and anthropogenic heat flux (AHF), around densely distributed meteorological stations were extracted from satellite images. These parameters were used as independent variables to construct an RF model for predicting air temperature. The correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed air temperature in the test set was 0.73, and the average root-mean-square error was 0.72ÄÄ C. Then, the spatial distribution of CUHII was evaluated at 30Äm resolution based on the output of the RF model. We found that wind speed was negatively correlated with CUHII, and wind direction was strongly correlated with the CUHII offset direction. The CUHII reduced with the distance to the city center, due to the decreasing proportion of built-up areas and reduced AHF in the same direction. The RF model framework developed for real-time monitoring and assessment of high spatial and temporal resolution (30Äm and 1Äh) CUHII provides scientific support for studying the changes and causes of CUHII, as well as the spatial pattern of urban thermal environments.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and Landsat thermal bands were used to retrieve LULC and LST changing patterns for 1999, 2009 and 2019, respectively. The Cellular Automata (CA) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning algorithms were applied to simulate the LULC and seasonal LST scenarios for 2029 and 2039. The CA and ANN model were validated using simulated and estimated LULC and LST data for 2019. The CA model demonstrated an excellent accuracy with an overall kappa value of 0.82. Mean Square Error (MSE) and Correlation coefficient (R) values were used for ANN model validation, which also produced excellent results with 0.523 and 0.796 in summer and 0.6023 and 0.831 in winter season, respectively. Simulated LULC revealed a substantial increase in the urban built-up areas by 9.23% (2029) and 13.59% (2039), compared with the year 2019. Simulated summer LST demonstrates that 31.30% and 35.02% area will likely to face surface temperature more than 36 degrees C, followed by 1.28% and 29.53% area in winter season for year 2029 and 2039, respectively. The seasonal LST scenarios in different LULC demonstrated comparatively higher temperatures in built-up areas. Based on the results, a strong correlation was found between the changes in urban areas and raising LST by representing major encounters for environmental engineers and urban planners to mitigate the consequences of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) phenomenon. For ensuring sustainable urban growth and minimizing the SUHI effect in this fastest-growing megacity, future city master plan must focus on the importance of urban plantation and conservation of natural resources.","[Kafy, Abdulla-Al; Abdullah-Al-Faisal; Shuvo, Ragib Mahmood; Chowdhury, Radwan Rahman; Islam, Md Arshadul; Sarker, Md Hasnan Sakin; Khan, Md Hasib Hasan] Rajshahi Univ Engn & Technol RUET, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Rajshahi 6204, Bangladesh; [Kafy, Abdulla-Al] Rajshahi City Corp, ICLEI South Asia, Rajshahi 6203, Bangladesh; [Abdullah-Al-Faisal] Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF, GIS Unit, Operat Ctr Amsterdam OCA, Coxs Bazar 4750, Bangladesh; [Naim, Md Nazmul Huda; Sikdar, Md Soumik] Chittagong Univ Engn & Technol CUET, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Chattogram 4349, Bangladesh; [Naim, Md Nazmul Huda; Sikdar, Md Soumik] Bangladesh Rural Adv Comm BRAC, Coxs Bazar, Bangladesh; [Kona, Marium Akter] Bangladesh Army Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Natore 6431, Bangladesh",REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT,10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100463,44,15,No,,Bangladesh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Landsat images and machine learning algorithms have been used to identify the urban growth, LST and UHI distribution patterns in several city directions. In addition, correlation analysis has been conducted between LST, SUHI and spectral indices (NDBI, NDBSI, NDVI, NDWI). Results suggested that urban expansion increased LST by 7 Â°C in summer and 6 Â°C in winter from 1995 to 2020. Increment has also occurred in summer high SUHI from 0.25 km2 to 2.65 km2. Pearson correlation demonstrated that built-up areas have a strong positive relationship with LST (0.96) and SUHI (0.911). Future simulation of urban expansion for 2025 and 2030 shows a 9 % increase, leading to a significant increase in moderate to high SUHI intensity.

In this study, the fine-scale investigation of the thermal environment is comprehensively assessed by field measurement in five representative blocks in Xi'an, China. Twenty-two potential morphological variables from spatial composition, land-use features, and surrounding environment were obtained from the geographic information system. Both the ordinary least squares (OLS) and random forest (RF) models were adopted to explore the relationship between the thermal parameters and the predictor variables. The modeling results demonstrate that the RF model, effectively capturing the nonlinear relationship, outperforms the OLS model in study areas with a higher R2, a lower MSE and MAE values. The RF-based results clearly disclose that surrounding variables, such as distance to industry area (DI) and water bodies (DW), are generally the top-3 variables with the highest contribution rate (mean SHAP value>0.1) during the different periods. Building density is also a stronger driving factor than building height. Moreover, all important variables have an obvious nonlinear relationship with the threshold effect for the diurnal thermal environment variation. The proper thresholds for DI and DW are 3200 m and 1500 m, respectively, indicating that controlling DI larger than 3200 m and DW less than 1500 m may contribute to mitigating the heat island in Xi'an.

These factors elevate the urban-rural air temperature (T-a) difference, thus generating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. T-a is used in the fields of public health and epidemiology to quantify deaths attributable to heat in cities around the world: the presence of UHI can exacerbate exposure to high temperatures during summer periods, thereby increasing the risk of heat-related mortality. Measuring and monitoring the spatial patterns of T-a in urban contexts is challenging due to the lack of a good network of weather stations. This study aims to produce a parsimonious model to retrieve maximum T-a (T-max) at high spatio-temporal resolution using Earth Observation (EO) satellite data. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) it will produce daily estimations of T-max for London at 1 km(2) during the summertime between 2006 and 2017 using advanced statistical techniques and satellite-derived predictors, and (ii) it will investigate for the first time the predictive power of the gradient boosting algorithm to estimate T-max for an urban area. In this work, 6 regression models were calibrated with 6 satellite products, 3 geospatial features, and 29 meteorological stations. Stepwise linear regression was applied to create 9 groups of predictors, which were trained and tested on each regression method. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict T-max: the gradient boosting model with a group of five predictors (land surface temperature, Julian day, normalised difference vegetation index, digital elevation model, solar zenith angle) was the regression model with the best performance (R-2 = 0.68, MAE = 1.60 degrees C, and RMSE = 2.03 degrees C). This methodological approach is capable of being replicated in other UK cities, benefiting national heat-related mortality assessments since the data (provided by NASA and the UK Met Office) and programming languages (Python) sources are free and open. This study provides a framework to produce a high spatio-temporal resolution of T-max, assisting public health researchers to improve the estimation of mortality attributable to high temperatures. In addition, the research contributes to practice and policy-making by enhancing the understanding of the locations where mortality rates may increase due to heat. Therefore, it enables a more informed decision-making process towards the prioritisation of actions to mitigate heat-related mortality amongst the vulnerable population.","[dos Santos, Rochelle Schneider] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth Environm & Soc, London, England",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,10.1016/j.jag.2020.102066,48,12,Yes,"LR,RT,RFR,GBRT,SVR,ANN(MLP)",England,Yes,Air temperature,Estimating air temperature,"Meteorological data

Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of urban greening initiatives of cities worldwide aimed at mitigating these issues. However, ET estimation methods in urban areas have so far been limited. An expanding number of flux towers in urban environments provide the opportunity to directly measure ET by the eddy covariance method. In this study, we present a novel approach to model urban ET by combining flux footprint modeling, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) data, and deep learning and machine learning techniques. This approach facilitates spatio-temporal extrapolation of ET at a half-hourly resolution; we tested this approach with a two-year dataset from two flux towers in Berlin, Germany. The benefit of integrating remote sensing and GIS data into models was investigated by testing four predictor scenarios. Two algorithms (1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and random forest (RF)) were compared. The best-performing models were then used to model ET values for the year 2019. The inclusion of GIS data extracted using flux footprints enhanced the predictive accuracy of models, particularly when meteorological data was more limited. The best-performing scenario (meteorological and GIS data) showed an RMSE of 0.0239 mm/h and R2 of 0.840 with RF and an RMSE of 0.0250 mm/h and a R2 of 0.824 with 1D CNN for the more vegetated site. The 2019 ET sum was substantially higher at the site surrounded by more urban greenery (366 mm) than at the inner-city site (223 mm), demonstrating the substantial influence of vegetation on the urban water cycle. The proposed method is highly promising for modeling ET in a heterogeneous urban environment and can support climate change mitigation initiatives of urban areas worldwide.

To understand the magnitude and characteristics of UHI in Seoul and to accommodate for the high temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of the UHI which make it inherently challenging to analyze using conventional statistical methods, we developed two deep learning models, a temporal UHI-model and a spatial UHI model, using a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) architecture.

This research aims to discern the success of sustainability planning by examining and comparing the different characteristics of UHIs through the combination of machine learning and statistical methods. To achieve this, we analyze 4 new towns in Korea, which include two âoldâ new towns and two ârecentâ new towns. The key difference between our test towns lies on whether or not the sustainability policies were applied to their development plans. We visualize LST and conduct a k-mean clustering to find and quantify spatial patterning in the resulting UHI measures. We then compare the statistical relations between LST and 6 UHI driven variables across the towns. Using comparative analysis, this research reveals that sustainable development policies have a notable effect on the patterns and intensities of UHI. Urban structures, planned under development policies, including green and blue space ratios, road networks, and housing distributions, were found to affect UHI significantly. We quantifiably confirm that the sustainability policies implemented in planning the ârecentâ new towns allow the towns to experience less aggravated UHIs than the âoldâ new towns. However, we also claim a need to develop appropriate, long-term UHI management regulations for the ârecentâ new towns.

An analysis using the Ridge Regression Model found that 71% of land surface temperature anomalies in Istanbul are linked to building coverage ratio (BCR), surface/volume ratio (SVR), sky-view factor (SVF), canyon geometry factor (CGF), and vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI and BCR were the urban fabric components with the highest contribution to SUHI formation, while the effects of SVF and CGF remained relatively low.

To obtain the spatial distributions of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an in summer and develop a simultaneous control strategy of ozone and urban heat island, the land use regression model is modified and improved using the machine learning random forest algorithm. The LUR-Kriging-RF integrated prediction model is then established. The land use regression and kriging are used to extract the feature variables, while random forest is used to establish a regression model. The spatial distribution maps of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an are obtained by regression mapping of the prediction model, and the spatial relationships between them are analyzed. The SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) and partial dependence plot (PDP) are adopted to explain the way feature variables act on ozone and urban heat island. Based on the spatial distribution and interaction mode, a simultaneous control strategy of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an is put forward. For ozone, the R2 of the integrated prediction model (0.65) is higher than that of land use regression (0.4), while the RMSE (28.18) of the integrated model is lower than that of land use regression (35.66). For temperature, the R2 of the integrated model (0.93) is higher than that of land use regression (0.8), while its RMSE (0.92) is lower than that of land use regression (1.52). The performance of the LUR-Kriging-RF integrated prediction model is better than that of land use regression. This study reveals the spatial interactions between ozone and land use regression in the central urban areas. The suitable strategies for mapping ozone pollution and urban heat island control include reducing VOCs emissions from industrial sources and agricultural sources, increasing plants with low VOCs emissions, and spray humidification. This study can be used to evaluate ozone exposure and thermal exposure, provide scientific support for environmental protection and urban heat island control policies, contribute to reducing public health threats, promote the sustainability of urban environments, and promote the practical application of machine learning in this field.

In the urban context, such adaptation strategies require a thorough understanding of the built-up response to the incoming solar radiation, i.e., the urban energy balance cycle and its implications for the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Despite readily available, diurnal Land Surface Temperature (LST) data does not provide a meaningful picture of the UHI, in these midlatitudes FUAs. On the contrary, the mid-morning satellite overpass is characterized by the absence of a significant surface UHI (SUHI) signal, corresponding to the period of the day when the urban-rural air temperature difference is typically negative. Conversely, nocturnal high-resolution LST data is rarely available. In this study, an energy balance-based machine learning approach is explored, considering the Local Climate Zones (LCZ), to describe the daily cycle of the heat flux components and predict the nocturnal SUHI, during an HW event. While the urban and rural spatial outlines are not visible in the diurnal thermal image, they become apparent in the latent and storage heat flux maps â built-up infrastructures uptake heat during the day which is released back into the atmosphere, during the night, whereas vegetation land surfaces loose diurnal heat through evapotranspiration. For the LST prediction model, a random forest (RF) approach is implemented. RF results show that the model accurately predicts the LST, ensuring mean square errors inferior to 0.1 K. Both the latent and storage heat flux components, together with LCZ classification, are the most important explanatory variables for the nocturnal LST prediction, supporting the adoption of the energy balance approach. In future research, other locations and time-series data shall be trained and tested, providing an efficient local urban climate monitoring tool, where in-situ air temperature observations are not available.

Although prior researches have showed that 2D/3D architectural pattern can significantly affect LST, the comprehensive effect of 2D/3D architectural pattern on thermal environment is still controversial and obscure due to the impact of architectural pattern on LST would vary under different observational scales and seasons, making it necessary to examine the temporal variation and scale-dependent of the relationship between them. This study takes Hangzhou as a study area to probe the relationship between seasonal LST and 2D/3D building metrics across ten analytical scales. Major findings include: (1) From spring to winter, the spatial dependency of LST becomes weaker with the increasing observational scale. (2) The regression analysis results show that the mean architecture projection area (MAPA), building coverage ratio (BCR), floor area ratio (FAR) and mean architecture height (MAH) are the most dominant metrics, with the range of average relative contributions are 10.96â16.68%, 14.61â45.20%, 7.90â17.05% and 5.80â14.23% in four seasons. Moreover, the relative contributions of chosen metrics on seasonal LST exhibit consistency in spring, summer and autumn. (3) The marginal effect analysis results reveal that the threshold values of these four dominant metrics are sensitive to analytical scale and would reduce with the analytical unit increases in four seasons. These findings indicate that controlling the building density, building height and floor area ratio of built-up areas in a reasonable range according to the spatial scale of planning unit, advocating more dispersed arrangement of the buildings and smaller architectural base area in Hangzhou can be favorable in ameliorating thermal environment.

The urban-rural gradient analysis serves as a unique natural opportunity to identify and mitigate ecological worsening. Using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Land Surface Temperature (LST) data in 2000, 2010, and 2019, we examined the spatial difference in daytime and nighttime LST trends along the urban-rural gradient in Greater Cairo, Egypt. Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning techniques were employed to conduct the spatio-temporal analysis. The analysis results revealed that impervious surfaces (ISs) increased significantly from 564.14 km2 in 2000 to 869.35 km2 in 2019 in Greater Cairo. The size, aggregation, and complexity of patches of ISs, green space (GS), and bare land (BL) showed a strong correlation with the mean LST. The average urban-rural difference in mean LST was -3.59 ÂºC in the daytime and 2.33 ÂºC in the nighttime. In the daytime, Greater Cairo displayed the cool island effect, but in the nighttime, it showed the urban heat island effect. We estimated that dynamic human activities based on the urban structure are causing the spatial difference in the LST distribution between the day and night. The urban-rural gradient analysis indicated that this phenomenon became stronger from 2000 to 2019. Considering the drastic changes in the spatial patterns and the density of IS, GS, and BL, urban planners are urged to take immediate steps to mitigate increasing surface UHI; otherwise, urban dwellers might suffer from the severe effects of heatwaves.

At an urban level, this study collected various sources of data and proposed a machine learning method (Back Propagation Neural Network - BPNN) to predict different functions of UBCE by BEF in Changxing, a representative small city in China. The study found that UBCE can be significantly affected by BEF such as density, function, and morphology. The BPNN has a good prediction performance on different functions of UBCE, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is stable within 10 %â20 %. The prediction results showed that the average value of different functions of UBCE presented an obvious variation. The carbon emission map showed that the high UBCE are mainly clustered in the middle-east and south of the central city of Changxing. By comparison with other studies, the accuracy of this method was proved. This method could be applied to predict carbon emissions of the urban planning scheme. Optimizing the BEF of urban blocks can play key roles in the reduction of carbon emissions and then alleviation of the UHI.

Existing literature has revealed the UHI characteristics and driving factors at an urban scale, but interactions between the main factors of a global grid scale assessment on the context of climate zones remain unclear. Therefore, based on the multidimensional climatic and socio-economic statistical datasets, the multi-time scale of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHI) characteristics was investigated in this study to analyze how natural-anthropogenic drivers affect the variance of SUHI and vary in their importance for the changes of other interaction factors. The results show that the mean value of SUHI in summer is higher than in winter, and in daytime is higher than in nighttime on a seasonal and daily scale. SUHIs in different global climate zones have significant differences. When analyzing driversâ contributions and interactions with LightGBM model and SHAP algorithm, we know that monthly precipitation (PREC), the estimated population (POP) and surface pressure (PRES) are the three major drivers of daytime SUHI. The nighttime SUHI is mainly PREC, POP and anthropogenic heat emission (AHE), the influence rules of the natural drivers are mostly opposite to that of daytime. This study highlights the fundamental role of background climate for designing strategies. Irrigation or artificial rainfall will be effective to mitigate SUHI in low rainfall areas, while it is more effective to reduce AHE in high rainfall areas. In where greening can be difficult in the most developed cities, reducing AHE, increasing per capita GDP and controlling the population scale may also contribute to alleviating the SUHI. This study provides ideas for developing responsive urban heat island mitigation policies in a more realistic setting.

Building science practitioners and researchers have been able to select from a variety of weather files, such as Weather Year for Energy Calculation 2 (WYEC2) and the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY). However, commonly used weather files are typically synthesized to represent trends over a relatively longer periods of time, and are often unable to accurately depict climatic conditions that result from local contexts, such as the heat island effect, wind flow, even local temperature and relative humidity. This results in discrepancies in building performance simulations. This study proposes a methodology using recurrent neural networks to generate synthetic localized weather data that are significantly more accurate and representative of local conditions than standard weather files. The predictions were validated against actual on-site measurements, and achieved a low mean square error of 2.96 and over 185% improvement in validation accuracy. Overall, the performance of selected models has shown over 100% improvements in test accuracy compared with standard weather files and weather station data at the nearest airport. The proposed methodology can be used to morph generic weather files to accurately represent localized conditions, or generate localized data for a longer time span with only a subset of data available/collected. This is useful for downstream built environment applications, especially building energy modeling, since representative weather data capturing trends of temperature and other variables will result in enhanced accuracies of the building energy models. The method can also be used in urban analysis pipelines to enhance resilience against climate change.

The main challenges faced by cities currently and towards the future are the rapid urbanization, the increase in urban temperature and the urban heat island. Mapping and monitoring urban fabric (UF) to analyze the environmental impact of these phenomena is more necessary than ever. This coupled with the increased availability of Earth observation data and their growing temporal capabilities leads us to consider using temporal features for improving land use classification, especially in urban environments where the spectral overlap between classes makes it challenging. Urban land use classification thus remains a central question in remote sensing. Although some research studies have successfully used multi-temporal images such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 to improve land cover classification, urban land use mapping is rarely carried using the temporal dimension. This paper explores the use of Sentinel-2 data in a deep learning framework, by firstly assessing the temporal robustness of four popular fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) trained over single-date images for the classification of the urban footprint, and secondly, by proposing a multi-temporal FCN. A performance comparison between the proposed framework and a regular FCN is also conducted. In this study, we consider four UF classes typical of many European Western cities. Results show that training the proposed multi-date model on Sentinel 2 multi-temporal data achieved the best results with a Kappa coefficient increase of 2.72% and 6.40%, respectively for continuous UF and industrial facilities. Although a more definitive conclusion requires further testing, first results are promising because they confirm that integrating the temporal dimension with a high spatial resolution into urban land use classification may be a valuable strategy to discriminate among several urban categories.","[El Mendili, Lamiae; Chougrad, Mehdi; Sebari, Imane] IAVH2, Sch Geomat & Surveying Engn, Rabat 10101, Morocco; [Puissant, Anne] Univ Strasbourg, Dept Geog, CNRS, LIVE,UMR 7362, F-67000 Strasbourg, France",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs12030423,25,7,No,,"Morocco,France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To develop such policies, accurate and pre-emptive estimations of current and future UHI manifestations are vital elements that help determine efficient policies and mitigation techniques. There are two fundamental approaches for modelling overheating in an urban environment: white-box and black-box based methods. The first one is characterized by the easily interpretable working process, while the unclear working procedure defines the second one. The present study comprehensively reviews the commonly used white-box and black-box based approaches applied for UHI predictions, analyses the existing literature adopting these tools for UHI prediction, and discusses the effectiveness of fusing both methods at the design and operation stages of the urban area for effective prediction and mitigation of UHI effect. The literature analysis showed that the transparent working process and high prediction accuracy of the physical-based white-box models make them a popular and reliable tool for UHI evaluation. Nevertheless, some white-box based simulation tools are too complex and require a high level of expertise to operate, leading to potential inaccuracies in the obtained outcomes. Black-box models, in turn, despite their opaque working process, are more straightforward in use and require less computation time. The fusion of these two methods is a novel approach that may benefit both UHI prediction and mitigation at the design and operation stages, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Department of Architectural Engineering, Kyung Hee University, 1732, Deogyeong-daero, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, 17104, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,10.1016/j.rser.2022.112520,14,7,"No, review",,South Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the modulations of the former two have been extensively studied, there is still a lack of understanding of the importance of urban morphology, especially the three-dimensional (3D) morphology at a global scale. Here we examine the surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensities in 688 urban agglomerations worldwide and explore their driving factors in terms of surface properties, climate background, and 2D/3D urban morphologies, by using stepwise multiple linear regression and interpretable machine learning method. The results show that the interpretable machine learning method performs better in modeling SUHIs than traditional linear regression. Notably, urban morphologies, particularly its 3D pattern, have significant impacts on SUHIs. The overall contribution of urban morphology is comparable to that of surface property, and even surpasses the latter during the daytime in autumn and winter. Specifically, increased urban patch size or higher urban density can significantly amplify the SUHI intensities, while urban expansion characterized by scattered or multi-centered development exhibits the potential in mitigating SUHIs. In terms of 3D urban morphology, building height emerges as a crucial factor in shaping SUHIs. A rougher urban surface characterized by high-rise buildings can yield a cooling effect during the daytime while exacerbating the warming effect at night. Overall, our research provides valuable insights into the role of urban morphology in shaping SUHIs, offering guidance for urban planning strategies that promote sustainable and resilient cities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","School of Geography and Planning, Guangdong Key Laboratory for Urbanization and Geo-simulation, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510006, China; Tianhe District Branch of Guangzhou Municipal Planning and Natural Resources Bureau, Guangzhou, 510000, China; Institute of Environment, Energy and Sustainability, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Guangdong Provincial Academy of Environmental Science, Guangzhou, 510045, China; Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai), Zhuhai, 519082, China",Building and Environment,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110581,7,7,No,,"China,Hong Kong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To mitigate the urban heat island in the developed and developing cities, a very accurate land cover classification has to be developed. Through which we can identify the changes in build-up areas, water bodies and vegetation index. In this paper, a hybrid hot encoding VGG19 deep learning method has been proposed. And a transfer learning method has been used to transfer the training data trained by the RestNet50 method to the proposed HGVGG19 method.

Through which the image has been resized and processed for training it with the proposed mode. The categorical data cannot be processed directly, so we use one hot encoding method to find the borders of the class. Then the data has been trained using VGG19 method. Then using the MLR classifier we classify the images and using decision tree the class prediction has been predicted. After testing the model an accuracy of 98.5% has been achieved.

Higher nocturnal air temperature (Tair) is associated with adverse effects on human health, higher mortality rates, and higher energy consumption. Prediction of the spatial distribution of Tair is a step toward the 'Smart City' concept, providing an early warning system for vulnerable populations. The study of the spatial distribution of urban Tair was thus far limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources. Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring Tair continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city. In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of nocturnal Tair in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and Urban Atlas, crowdsourced Tair data, and machine learning (ML) methods. Results were tested with a 'leave-one-date-out' training scheme (testingcrowd) and reference Tair data (testingref).

This study provides an in-depth exploration of these relationships in the context of the Kamrup Metropolitan District, Northeast India, over a period of 22 years (2000-2022) and forecasts the potential implications up to 2032. Employing a high-accuracy supervised machine learning algorithm for LULC analysis, significant transformations are revealed, including the considerable growth in urban built-up areas and the corresponding decline in cultivated land. Concurrently, a progressive rise in LST is observed, underlining the escalating UHI effect. This association is further substantiated through correlation studies involving the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The study further leverages the cellular automata-artificial neural network (CA-ANN) model to project the potential scenario in 2032, indicating a predicted intensification in LST, especially in regions undergoing rapid urban expansion. The findings underscore the environmental implications of unchecked urban growth, such as rising temperatures and the intensification of UHI effects. Consequently, this research stresses the critical need for sustainable land management and urban planning strategies, as well as proactive measures to mitigate adverse environmental changes.

In urban areas, it exacerbates the urban heat island phenomenon. It impacts the health of the inhabitants and the sensation of thermal discomfort felt in urban areas. Thus, it is necessary to estimate as well as possible the air temperature at any point of a territory, in particular in view of the ongoing rationalization of the network of fixed meteorological stations of Meteo-France. Understanding the air temperature is increasingly in demand to input quantitative models related to a wide range of fields, such as hydrology, ecology, or climate change studies. This study thus proposes to model air temperature, measured during four mobile campaigns carried out during the summer months, between 2016 and 2019, in Lyon (France), in clear sky weather, using regression models based on 33 explanatory variables from traditionally used data, data from remote sensing by LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), or Landsat 8 satellite acquisition. Three types of statistical regression were experimented: partial least square regression, multiple linear regression, and a machine learning method, the random forest regression. For example, for the day of 30 August 2016, multiple linear regression explained 89% of the variance for the study days, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 0.23 degrees C. Variables such as surface temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have a strong impact on the estimation model. This study contributes to the emergence of urban cooling systems. The solutions available vary. For example, they may include increasing the proportion of vegetation on the ground, facades, or roofs, increasing the number of basins and water bodies to promote urban cooling, choosing water-retaining materials, humidifying the pavement, increasing the number of public fountains and foggers, or creating shade with stretched canvas.","[Alonso, Lucille; Renard, Florent] Univ Jean Moulin Lyon 3, UMR CNRS 5600 Environm City & Soc, Dept Geog & Spatial Planning, F-69007 Lyon, France",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs12152434,17,5,Yes,"RFR,LR",France,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to the limited observational records of air temperature and the complex urban morphology and environment, it might not be easy to map the hourly air temperature with a fine resolution at the surface level within and around cities via conventional methods. Thus, this study employed machine learning (ML) algorithms and meteorological and landscape data to develop hourly air temperature mapping techniques and methods at the 1-km resolution over a multi-year warm seasons period. Guangdong Province, China was selected for the case study. Random forest algorithm was employed for the hourly air temperature mapping. The validation results showed that the hourly air temperature maps exhibit good accuracy from 2008 to 2019, with mean R2, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.8001, 1.4821 Â°C and 1.0872 Â°C, respectively. The importance assessment of the driving factors showed that meteorological factors, especially relative humidity, contributed the most to the air temperature mapping. Simultaneously, landscape factors also played a non-negligible role. Further analysis revealed that the maps steadily maintained high accuracy at nighttime (20:00â7:00), which is essential for investigating nighttime urban climate conditions, especially the urban heat island effect. Moreover, a correlation existed between the nighttime air temperature changes and urban morphology represented by the local climate zones. Air temperatures tended to fall more slowly in the core of metropolitan areas than in the urban fringe. Using ML, this study reliably improves the spatial refinement of hourly air temperature mapping and reveals the spatially explicit air temperature patterns in and around cities at different times in a day during the warm seasons.

Hence, cold-air paths are an important mitigation aspect in urban planning. The identification of cold-air paths by field measurements, however, is time-consuming and it is difficult to cover larger spatial domains (e.g. entire cities). Therefore, we used a machine learning technique, boosted regression trees (BRT), for estimating the spatial distribution of cold-air paths in three German cities (Braunschweig, Freiburg, Stuttgart). We identified the most important predictor variables for cold-air path occurrence and tested the spatial transferability of BRT models from one training city to the other study cities. Three variables explaining differences in surface elevation indicated strongest influence on spatial distribution of cold-air paths: relative surface elevation, topographic position index, and topographic wind index. We achieved predictions for the spatial distribution of cold-air paths for cities the model was trained on, resulting in model performances of 0.85 < AUC < 0.96 (AUC: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Model transfers to other cities, however, achieved only poor to moderate results (0.5 < AUC < 0.8). The city of Freiburg tended to be the most suitable basis for a general model, since it covers the largest range of conditions. Transfer works best for âsimilarâ cities, i.e. cities with a comparable range of predictor variables and morphological structure. Cold-air path identification via BRT modelling appeared to be a promising method delivering helpful information for urban planning.

Such modeling efforts require accurate temperature prediction which is then used for predicting other meteorological phenomena such as urban heat island and fine dust air pollution. The automatic weather system (AWS) provides accurate temperature with high frequency but it cannot grasp spatially continuous distribution in detail because it is collected only at specific points. On the contrary, the LST data obtained from satellite imagery has a high spatial resolution and spatially continuous temperature can be grasped, but it is difficult to get high temporal frequency temperature data because of its revisit time. In this study, to solve this spatio-temporal tradeoff problem, a deep-learning method was used to create a spatially continuous temperature image using AWS data with a spatial resolution of 30Â m. The seasonal temperature was predicted with accuracy of 3.6Â Â°C for spring, 1.9Â Â°C for summer, 3Â Â°C for fall, and 1.4Â Â°C for winter. The predicted temperature accuracy for spatial resolution of 30Â m is better than other reported interpolation methods. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of the model, fine tuning procedures were applied to the deep learning model hyper parameters as well as the input feature data.

The timely and accurate identification of existing urban tree species with their location is the most important task for improving air, water, and land quality; reducing carbon accumulation; mitigating urban heat island effects; and protecting soil and water balance. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is frequently used for extracting high-resolution structural information regarding tree objects. LiDAR systems are a cost-effective alternative to the traditional ways of identifying tree species, such as field surveys and aerial photograph interpretation. The aim of this work was to assess the usage of machine learning algorithms for classifying the deciduous (broadleaf) and coniferous tree species from 3D raw LiDAR data on the Davutpasa Campus of Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey. First, ground, building, and low, medium, and high vegetation classes were acquired from raw LiDAR data using a hierarchical-rule-based classification method. Next, individual tree crowns were segmented using a mean shift clustering algorithm from high vegetation points. A total of 25 spatial- and intensity-based features were utilized for support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers to discriminate deciduous and coniferous tree species in the urban area. The machine learning-based classification's overall accuracies were 80%, 83.75%, and 73.75% for the SVM, RF, and MLP classifiers, respectively, in split 70/30 (training/testing). The SVM and RF algorithms generally gave better classification results than the MLP algorithm for identifying the urban tree species.","[Cetin, Zehra; Yastikli, Naci] Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Geomat Engn, Davutpasa Campus, TR-34220 Istanbul, Turkey",ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,10.3390/ijgi11040226,9,5,No,,Turkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This literature review shows that new satellite sensors and valuable methods have been developed for calculating land surface temperature (LST) and UHI intensity, and for assessing UHIRIP. Additionally, some of the limitations of using remotely sensed data to analyze the LST, UHI, and UHI intensity are discussed. Finally, we review a variety of applications in UHI and UHIRIP analyses. The assimilation of time-series remotely sensed data with the application of data fusion, gap filling models, and deep learning using the Google Cloud platform and Google Earth Engine platform also has the potential to improve the estimation accuracy of change patterns of UHI and UHIRIP over long time periods. © 2021 by the authors.

In large-scale climate modeling, a common preliminary operation is to utilize the well-established Local Climate Zone classification to characterize the thermal response of urban areas based on morphology. With the increasing availability of urban datasets, data-driven approaches can be implemented to quantitatively derive meaningful urban features without relying on a standardized classification. The proposed methodology employs a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to partition the urban territory into a suitable number of homogeneous microclimate zones, enabling the calculation and mapping of the UHII for each zone through the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) tool. The developed approach is applied to the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, identifying ten microclimatic areas and analyzing the spatiotemporal variation of UHII. Results show yearly average values of UHII ranging from 1.7 °C to 2.2 °C, depending on urban morphology. The simulated values are partially validated by comparison with on-site measurements from two urban weather stations, yielding a satisfactory agreement.

Most estimation methods only provide ozone products at a relatively coarse resolution, such as 5 km, but high-resolution ozone data are essential for ozone pollution prevention and control. To this end, we proposed a new framework for estimating ozone concentrations at 300 m resolution in China based on Landsat 8 infrared (IR) bands and meteorological data using a deep forest (DF) model. DF combines the excellent performance of tree integration with the expressive power of hierarchical distributed representations of neural networks. The accuracy and mapping results of DF are considerably better than some widely used machine learning methods (generalized regression neural regression network and random forest). The sample-based cross-validation (CV), station-based CV, time-based CV, and extrapolation validation show that the estimations of DF are in high agreement with the station observations with determination coefficient values of 0.938, 0.926, 0.687, and 0.660, respectively. The proposed method was used to analyze the spatial and temporal ozone variations at fine scales in three typical Chinese cities (Beijing, Wuhan and Guangzhou), where the mean ozone concentrations during the polluted season are consistent with the land use and urban heat island distribution. The rationality of ozone estimates was verified, and the advantages of high-resolution mapping was demonstrated by comparing the monitoring data from municipal controlling stations in Beijing, 10 km ozone products, and satellite images. Our product can represent spatial details and locate local pollution sources, such as temples. The proposed method has important implications for the fine-scale monitoring of ozone pollution.

Further, both urban thermal environment research and sustainable development planning require an efficient estimation of anthropogenic heat flux (AHF). Therefore, this study proposed an improved multi-source AHF model, which was constructed using diverse data sources and small-scale samples, to better represent the spatiotemporal distribution of AHF. The performances of three machine learning algorithms (Cubist, gradient boosting decision tree, and simple linear regression) were quantitatively evaluated, and the impact of spatiotemporal heterogeneity on AHF estimation was considered for the first time. The results showed that multi-source datasets and sophisticated algorithms could more effectively reduce the estimation error and improve the accuracy of the spatiotemporal distribution of AHF than simple linear regression. In practical applications, the Cubist model performed better, with prediction errors being less than 0.9 Wâmâ2. Further, the characteristics of different heat sources from the model outputs varied widely, and the building metabolic heat exhibited significant seasonal spatiotemporal variations, which were largely determined by the regional climate. In contrast, industrial and transportation heat showed marginal monthly fluctuations. Similarly, spatiotemporal heterogeneity significantly affected the estimation of building metabolic heat (0.62 Wâmâ2), but it did not affect other heat sources. The proposed improved AHF model was verified to effectively capture the spatiotemporal variations of building heat and solve the issue of overestimation of industrial heat in urban regions. This study provides new methods and ideas for the accurate spatiotemporal quantification of AHF that can supplement future studies on climate warming, UHI, and air pollution.

Among these time scales, estimation of next-day SUHIs is of special significance to urban residents, yet we currently lack a simple but efficient approach for making such estimations. In the present study, we propose a statistical strategy for estimating next-day nighttime SUHIs, based on incorporating various SUHI controls into a support vector machine regression (SVR) model. The majority of both the surface controls (including factors related to land cover and solar radiation) and meteorological controls (including temperature fluctuations, relative humidity, accumulated precipitation, wind speed, aerosol optical depth, and soil moisture) that have previously been found to account for daily SUHI variations were used as estimators, and we provide estimations for both the overall SUHI intensity (SUHII) and pixel-by-pixel Gaussian-based LSTs over 59 Chinese megacities. For the overall SUHII, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.67 K on average, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is no more than 25% for more than 90% of the cities. For the pixel-by-pixel LSTs, the associated MAE is less than 2.0 K in most scenarios. In addition, the contribution from each selected estimator to SUHII estimation is assessed comprehensively. Among all the estimators, the contribution from relative humidity is the greatest, followed by rural surface temperature and surface air temperature. Moreover, for nearly 78% of the cities, the estimators related to day-to-day SUHI variations make a larger contribution than those related to intra-annual SUHI variations. We conclude that our simple yet effective statistical approach for estimating next-day SUHIs can potentially help urban residents to better adapt to urban heat stress.

Recent methodological advances show promise in achieving high spatiotemporal temperature predictions, thus improving the characterization of spatial variations in temperature and decreasing bias in health studies.

Models presented here managed to capture temporal and spatial variations in air temperature in Switzerland from 2003 to 2018 at a fine spatial resolution of 100 × 100 m. Stage 1 models achieved an overall R2 of 0.98 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.49°C (independent validation), and the stage 2 model performed well for all years with R2 and RMSE ranging from 0.94 to 0.99 and 1.05 to 1.86°C, respectively.

However, most of the efforts only focus on one of the two schemes, usually on a specific scale. This leads to unnecessary redundancies since the learned features could be leveraged for both of these related tasks. In this letter, the concept of multitask learning (MTL) is introduced to HSE regression and LCZ classification for the first time. We propose an MTL framework and develop an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN), which consists of a backbone network for shared feature learning, attention modules for task-specific feature learning, and a weighting strategy for balancing the two tasks. We additionally propose to exploit HSE predictions as a prior for LCZ classification to enhance the accuracy.

The urban heat island (UHI) effect has serious impacts on people's living environment and health, and has become an important concern for climate changes. Existing studies on environmental effects on UHI mainly focus on aspects related to urban horizontal expansion, but investigation into the effects of vertical urban growth (e.g., tall buildings) is limited. This study proposes a comprehensive set of features to characterize the planar and vertical aspects of urban environments by using panoramic Street View images (SVIs) and land cover data, and employs multiple linear regression and machine learning models to model land surface temperature (LST). Furthermore, an explainable AI method is applied to quantify the warming/cooling effects of each individual feature on LST. The results show that the proposed vertical/planar features contribute to the estimation of LST (R2 = 0.693). Adding the vertical features (extracted from SVIs) can improve LST prediction by 9.2% compared to using only planar features. Of all the features, built-up features contribute the most to LST variation, and large trees show strong cooling effects.

Land use change and population growth are known to impact UHI effects. Taking the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration in China as the study context, a rapid and simple method based on artificial neural networks was employed to spatially estimate UHI effects from 2040 to 2100. Considering carbon neutrality and pro-natalist policies, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) were integrated into combination scenarios: RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, and RCP4.5-SSP3. The risk of UHI effects was assessed through UHI hazard and population exposure. Results showed that compared with 2020, heat islands would decrease by 30% - 34% in area but increase by 29% - 37% in mean intensity by 2100. The population impacted by UHIs would increase by >10 million under the third scenario. Areas at high risk of UHI effects are mainly located in the urban core, with the total value of risk across the study area by 2100 being about 2 - 4 times higher than that in 2020. Our findings provide a forward-looking perspective to identify overall risk and critical areas in relation to UHI effects in the future through which clearer climatic-socioeconomic targets can be empirically grounded to minimize damage to public health. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Ministry of Education, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China; Key Laboratory for Environmental and Urban Sciences, School of Urban Planning & Design, Shenzhen Graduate School, Peking University, Shenzhen, 518055, China; Queensland Centre for Population Research, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4072, QLD, Australia",Urban Climate,10.1016/j.uclim.2023.101463,4,4,Yes,ANN,"China,Australia",Yes,LST and UHII at 1km spatial resolution,LST simulation and UHII simulation,"LST

In this context, we leverage machine learning, spatial modelling, and cloud computing to explore and predict the changing patterns in urban growth and associated thermal characteristics in Bahawalpur, Pakistan. Using multi-source earth observations (1990-2020), the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) is estimated to evaluate the urban heat island effect quantitatively. From 1990 to 2020, the urban area increased by similar to 90% at the expense of vegetation and barren land, which will further grow by 2050 (50%), as determined by the artificial neural network-based prediction. The land surface temperature in the summer and winter seasons has experienced an increase of 0.88 degrees C and similar to 5 degrees C, respectively. While there exists spatial heterogeneity in the UTFVI 1990-2020, the city is expected to experience a similar to 140% increase in areas with severe UTFVI in response to predicted LULC change by 2050. The study provides essential information on LULC change and UTFVI and puts forth useful insights to advance our understanding of the urban climate, which can progressively help in designing more livable and sustainable cities in the face of environmental changes.","[Waleed, Mirza; Sajjad, Muhammad] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Sajjad, Muhammad] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Ctr Geocomputat Studies, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Acheampong, Anthony Owusu] Univ Aberdeen, Kings Coll, Dept Geosci, Aberdeen AB24 3FX, Scotland; [Alam, Md.

The planning of urban buildings and urban green space (UGS) has a major impact on urban thermal environment. In this study, vegetation and landscape indices were taken as independent variables, and land surface temperature was taken as dependent variable, the gray-green space was used to predict local land surface temperature. The importance of each index was evaluated to explore the importance of gray-green space in mitigating the heat island effect and improving the thermal comfort. The results show that: 1) The characteristics of gray-green space can be used to predict the surface temperature, and the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBRT) model has the best prediction effect and higher accuracy. 2) The building material has a significant effect on the surface temperature, so consideration of the gray space allows a more accurate prediction effect of building material on the local surface temperature in cities. 3) In the course of predicting surface temperature, PLAND _ UGS is the most influential index, which is the proportion of UGS patches in landscape area. Overall, vegetation and landscape indices can predict local surface temperature. The findings can help city planners in designing better urban construction plans, so as to provide more effectively thermal comfort.

To address the urgent need for urban landscape mapping that goes beyond urban footprint analysis, the local climate zone (LCZ) scheme has been increasingly used to reveal the urban forms and functions important to urban heat islands and micro-climates across the globe. As with most supervised classification strategies, proper application of training data is critical for the success of LCZ classification models. However, the collection and application of LCZ training areas brings with it two challenges that may affect mapping success. First, because digitizing training areas is a time-consuming task, there is a broad effort in the LCZ mapping community to create a crowdsourced data collection among different experts. However, this strategy likely leads to inconsistencies in labels that could weaken models. Second, the LCZ labeling process typically involves the delineation of large zones from which multiple training samples are drawn, but those samples are likely spatially autocorrelated and lead to overly optimistic estimates of model accuracy. Although both effects â inconsistent labeling and spatial autocorrelation â are theoretically possible, it is unknown whether they substantially affect accuracy. We investigated both issues, specifically asking: (i) how do the discrepancies of LCZ labeling by different experts impact broad-scale LCZ mapping? (ii) to what extent does spatial correlation affect model prediction power? We used two classifiers (Random Forests and ResNets) to map eight metropolitan areas in the US into LCZs, comparing training areas drawn by different or consistent interpreters, and data splitting strategy using rules that allow or reduce spatial autocorrelation. We found large discrepancies among results built from crowdsourced training areas digitized by different experts; improving the consistency of labels can lead to substantial improvements in LCZ classification accuracy. Second, we found that spatial autocorrelation can boost the apparent accuracy of the classifier by 16% to 21%, leading to erroneous interpretation of mapping results. The two effects interplay as well: spatial autocorrelation in the raw data can lead to an underestimation of the model's predictive error when modeling with crowdsourced training areas of high inconsistency. Due to the uncertainty in the labeling process and spatial autocorrelation in derived training data, broad-scale LCZ mapping results should be interpreted with caution.

As the enhancement of the urban heat island effect, understanding the cooling efficiency of urban park and associated determinants has become critical for maximizing the ecological benefits of urban ecological infrastructure. In this paper, we measured holistically the cooling efficiency of urban parks from a relative and absolute perspective by using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite imageries. We adopted two novel cooling effect indices to rank and identify the inefficient park: DEA-based cooling efficiency index for relative efficiency and park cooling intensity index (PCII) for absolute efficiency. A total of 146 urban parks within the Shanghai metropolitan city was selected to conduct the empirical research. The correlation analysis and machine learning techniques (XGBoost) were also used to examine the relationships between the characteristics of parks and two cooling effect indices. The findings revealed that the average cooling efficiency of urban park in summer was approximately 2.7 times higher than that in winter. Park size and vegetation greenness (NDVI) were identified as the dominant factors for park cooling efficiency. Moreover, larger parks with area > 5Â ha showed better cooling performance on average. In the current study area, increasing the water body coverage ratio also played an important role on the improvement of cooling effect in both summer and winter. The research findings could provide valuable references for designing urban parks and for urban planning to maximize the cooling benefits and mitigate the UHI effects.

The DBN model was developed and applied for two different urban regions: Wuhan Metropolitan Area (WMA) in China, and Austin, Texas, USA. The model has a excellent ability to fit the complex nonlinear relationship between temperature and different predictive variables. After various adjustments to the model structure and different combinations of input variables, the daily 500-m air temperature in Wuhan Metropolitan Area (WMA) was initially generated by fusing remote sensing, reanalysis and in situ measurement products. The ten-fold cross-validation results indicated that the DBN model achieved promising results with the RMSE of 1.086 degrees C, MAE of 0.839 degrees C, and R-2 of 0.986. Compared with conventional data fusion algorithms, the DBN model also exhibited better performance. In addition, the detailed evaluation of the model on spatial and temporal scales proved the advantages of using DBN model to generate 3H temperature data. The spatial transferability of the model was tested by conducting a validation experiment for Austin, USA. In general, the results and fine-scale analyses show that the employed framework is effective to generate 3H temperature, which is valuable for urban climate and urban heat island research.","[Zhang, Xiang; Huang, Tailai; Song, Yu; Chen, Nengcheng] China Univ Geosci, Natl Engn Res Ctr Geog Informat Syst, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiang; Zeng, Jiangyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gulakhmadov, Aminjon] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Gulakhmadov, Aminjon] Natl Acad Sci Tajikistan, Inst Water Problems Hydropower & Ecol, Dushanbe 734042, Tajikistan; [Gu, Xihui] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xihui] Ctr Severe Weather & Climate & Hydrogeol Hazards, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xihui] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Huang, Shuzhe] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Nam, Won-Ho] Hankyong Natl Univ, Natl Agr Water Res Ctr, Sch Social Safety & Syst Engn, Inst Agr Environm Sci, 327 Jungang Ro, Anseong 17579, South Korea; [Chen, Nengcheng] Hubei Luojia Lab, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Niyogi, Dev] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Niyogi, Dev] Univ Texas Austin, Cockrell Sch Engn, Dept Civil Architecture & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs14153536,5,3,Yes,DBN,"Peoples R China,Tajikistan,England,South Korea,United States",No,Air temperature,Spatio-Temporally Continuous Air Temperature Generation,"Remotely Sensed Products MOD13Q1 NDVI 250 m 16 Days

It is crucial for urban planning and social development to monitor the urban heat island effect and study its mechanism. Due to spatial and temporal resolution limitations, existing land surface temperature (LST) data obtained from remote sensing data is challenging to meet the long-term fine-scale surface temperature mapping requirement. Given the above situation, this paper introduced the ResNet-based surface temperature downscaling method to make up for the data deficiency and applied it to the study of thermal environment change in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2000 to 2020. The results showed (1) the ResNet-based surface temperature downscaling method achieves high accuracy (R2 above 0.85) and is suitable for generating 30 m-resolution surface temperature data from 1 km data; (2) the area of severe heat islands in the GBA continued to increase, increasing by 7.13 times within 20 years; and (3) except for Hong Kong and Macau, the heat island intensity of most cities showed an apparent upward trend, especially the cities with rapid urban expansion such as Guangzhou, Zhongshan, and Foshan. In general, the evolution of the heat island in the GBA diverges from the central urban area to the surrounding areas, with a phenomenon of local aggregation and the area of the intense heat island in the Guangzhou-Foshan metropolitan area is the largest. This study can enrich the downscaling research methods of surface temperature products in complex areas with surface heterogeneity and provide a reference for urban spatial planning in the GBA. © 2022 by the authors.","Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Natural Resources, Shenzhen, 518040, China; School of Geosciences, Yangtze University, Wuhan, 430100, China; Shenzhen Planning and Natural Resources Data Management Center, Shenzhen, 518040, China; Big Data Technology Research Center, Nanhu Laboratory, Jiaxing, 314000, China; Institute of Geological Survey, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, 430074, China",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,10.3390/ijerph192417001,5,3,Yes,RESCNN,China,Yes,LST,MODIS LST 1000m to 30m,,"LST

This paper presents a novel approach to derive LST estimates by integrating machine learning algorithm and spatiotemporal fusion model at high spatial and temporal resolution. The spatial resolutions of Landsat TM and Landsat 8 LST data were first downscaled using random forest (RF) algorithm from 120 m and 100 m, respectively, to 30 m. The resultant LST data were fused with MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data, by means of the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion method (FSDAF), in order to generate high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST data covering the center of Chengdu city in China. The proposed new method was used to estimate the spatiotemporal variations of the summer daytime SUHI from 2009 to 2018 over Chengdu city. Results show that: (1) RF performs way better than the classical downscaling algorithm-thermal sharpening algorithm (TsHARP) for LST, and produces higher accuracy for different land covers; (2) the fused high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST values were evaluated with in situ LST obtained from Chengdu Meteorological Office and the final validation results indicated that the proposed method, in generating LST dataset, can provide more details of urban thermal environment and produce higher accuracy than the traditional FSDAF; (3) significantly increasing trends of summer daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) in the study area were observed. SUHII increased from 2.78 °C in 2009 to 4.04 °C in 2018.

One of the main impacts is the increase in temperature observed in urban areas, also known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. UHI has become the focus of several research studies due to the associated negative implications it causes. Despite that some research efforts examined different characteristics of the UHI phenomenon, there is a gap in the literature in terms of developing interpretable machine learning models that can accurately estimate or predict the severity of UHI (rather than air temperature or other UHI characteristics) as well as that can provide predictions on the census-tract level in the US. To that extent, this paper fills this gap by developing a knowledge-based white-box Bayesian network model that predicts UHI severity based on demographic, meteorological, and land use/land cover factors. First, a dataset for all census tracts in the state of New Jersey, USA was developed, which is comprised of 13 independent variables or factors affecting UHI severity. Second, expert knowledge was obtained from 10 UHI experts using the systematic three-round Delphi method to develop four different Bayesian network models. Third, the performance of the four Bayesian models was assessed and compared to choose the optimal model with the highest accuracy. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of each key factor on the UHI severity. The results showed that the optimal model is a tree-augmented Bayesian network that can predict or estimate the UHI severity with an accuracy of 87.88%. The outcomes of this paper also reflected that the following 8 variables are the key factors that impact UHI severity: NDVI during winter season, NDVI during summer season, imperviousness, tree canopy, building area, population density, water body areas, and annual rainfall. The findings also identified the land use/land cover category as the major category affecting UHI severity compared to demographic- and meteorological-related factors. The proposed white-box Bayesian network model in this paper adds to the body of knowledge by allowing practitioners and researchers to perform micro-level UHI predictions and inferences about future or unknown UHI severity pertaining to individual communities or small/localized geographical areas. This enables more focused and targeted UHI mitigation actions to be planned, designed, and implemented in the most affected communities, which ultimately results in better decisions, actions, and outcomes to reduce or address the UHI effect. © 2023","Smart Construction and Intelligent Infrastructure Systems (SCIIS) lab, John A.

Qingdao was selected in this study as a typical coastal city undergoing rapid urbanization, and the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of its urban surface thermal environment from 2010 to 2019 were evaluated. The random forest (RF) algorithm was adopted to obtain its land surface temperature (LST) map with 30-m resolution by downscaling the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product; the remote sensing indices emphasizing different land cover types, LST calculated by the radiative transfer equation, and elevation were used as input variables in the algorithm. The heat island intensity (HII), urban heat island (UHI) volume, and UHI grade were used to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of the urban surface thermal environment in Qingdao. The results show an increasing trend in average HII between 1.1 and 2.52°C in the study area over the past 10 years. The northern city appeared to have the highest UHI volume, while change of the UHI volume in Huangdao District of southwestern Qingdao was the most significant. The areas with high HII have gradually expanded during the last 10 years, and the areas with a 10-yr persistently high HII are distributed mainly in old urban areas with high building density and a dense population. Different factors may influence UHI, such as artificial heat sources, surface heat sources, and hybrid heat sources. Finally, adjusting the urban structure, increasing the vegetated area, and changing building colors are proposed to mitigate UHI in the areas with continuously high HII. © 2021, The Chinese Meteorological Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","School of Geosciences, Yangtze University, Wuhan, 430100, China; Nanhu Laboratory, Jiaxing, 314002, China; Beijing Big Data Advanced Technology Institute, Beijing, 100871, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Sciences, Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China",Journal of Meteorological Research,10.1007/s13351-021-0023-4,8,3,Yes,RF,China,Yes,"HII, UHI","HII, UHI, and high resultion temperature","Land Use, NDVI, SAVI, MNDWI, NDBI, MNDISI, BI

At the same time, a cell dichotomous model was established to explore the influencing factors of the urban heat island effect and the influence of different land use types and normalized vegetation indices in the Hangzhou metropolitan area was analyzed. The results showed that the overall heating trend of the study area showed a heating trend, the expansion rate of regional construction land was relatively fast, and the scale of urban land was increasing. Based on the results of surface temperature changes of areas with different land types, we obtained the temperature trends of each land type [from 2005 to 2018] and found that there was a negative correlation between surface temperature and normalized vegetation index. This study provides a theoretical basis to evaluate the urban heat island effect and analyze factors that impact it and would promote sustainable urban development. © The Author(s) 2023.","Shaoxing University, China; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Guizhou University, Guiyang, China; Southwest University, Chongqing, China; Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, United States",SAGE Open,10.1177/21582440231208851,3,3,No,,"China,United States",Yes,UHII,UHII,"LULC

Estimating the urban landscape and building surface temperature is the main challenge for 3D urban structures, especially given the challenge of preparing thousands of specific inputs for the simulations. This research conducted feature engineering to identify informative input features that are mostly related to urban surface temperature sensitivity, and then generated synthetic data using EnergyPlus simulations. ESMUST was built using artificial neural networks with 42 million entries of a synthetic dataset and thirteen input features. During the validation process, ESMUST achieved 0.964% bias and efficiently predicted the surface temperature of 3D urban models with fewer inputs. The main contribution of ESMUST is the development of a surrogate model to predict 3D urban surface temperature with fewer input features and less modeling complexity. This process has great potential to save building energy and improve the outdoor thermal environment in the context of climate change. Moreover, the framework developed for ESMUST is expected to be further applied in the future to evaluate nature-based solutions such as green façades for urban comfort and sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Department of Architecture, School of Architecture, Texas A&M University, 3137 TAMU, College Station, 77843, TX, United States",Building and Environment,10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109935,3,3,No,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evapotranspiration (ET) mitigates the urban heat island, reducing the effect of heat waves. It can also be used as a proxy for vegetation water use, making it a crucial tool to plan resilient green cities. To optimize the trade-off between urban greening and water security, reliable and up-to-date maps of ET for cities are urgently needed. Despite its importance, few studies have mapped urban ET accurately for an entire city in high spatial and temporal resolution. We mapped the ET of Berlin, Germany in high spatial (10-m) and temporal (hourly) resolution for the year of 2019. A novel machine learning (ML) approach combining Sentinel-2 time series, open geodata, and flux footprint modeling was applied. Two eddy flux towers with contrasting surrounding land cover provided the training and testing data. Flux footprint modeling allowed us to incorporate comprehensive land cover types in training the ML models. Open remote sensing and geodata used as model inputs included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, building height, impervious surface fraction, vegetation fraction, and vegetation height. NDVI was used to indicate vegetation phenology and health, as plant transpiration contributes to the majority of terrestrial ET. Hourly reference ET (RET) was calculated and used as input to capture the temporal dynamics of the meteorological conditions. Predictions were carried out using Random Forest (RF) regression. Weighted averages extracted from hourly ET maps using flux footprints were compared to measured ET from the two flux towers. Validation showed that the approach is reliable for mapping urban ET, with a mean R2 of 0.76 and 0.56 and a mean RMSE of 0.0289 mm and 0.0171 mm at the more vegetated site and the city-center site, respectively. Lastly, the variation of ET between Local Climate Zones (LCZs) was analyzed to support urban planning. This study demonstrated the capacity to map urban ET at an unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution with a novel methodology, which can be used to support the sustainable management of green infrastructure and water resources in an urbanizing world facing climate change. © 2023 The Authors","Geoinformation in Environmental Planning Lab, Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning, Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, 10623, Germany; Chair of Climatology, Institute of Ecology, Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, 12165, Germany; Division of Agronomy, University of Göttingen, Göttingen, 37075, Germany; Northern Rivers Institute, University of Aberdeen, St. Mary's Building, Kings College, Scotland, Old Aberdeen, AB24 3UE, United Kingdom; Department of Ecohydrology, Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Berlin, 12587, Germany; Department of Geography, Humboldt University of Berlin, Berlin, 10099, Germany",Remote Sensing of Environment,10.1016/j.rse.2023.113487,3,3,No,,"Germany,United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Population growth and urbanization result in negative consequences on the environment. Such land has experienced various environmental issues due to rapid urbanization and population increases. Such expansion in urbanization has a big impact on worsening the residences soon and in the long term, as the population is projected to increase more and more. One such issue is the urban heat island (UHI), which is computed based on land surface temperature (LST). The UHI effect has fundamental anthropogenic impacts on local areas, particularly in rapidly growing cities. This is due to the unplanned shifts in land use and land cover (LUALC) at the local level, which results in climate condition variations. Therefore, proper planning based on concrete information is the best policy in the long run to remedy these issues. In this study, we attempt to map out UHI phenomena using machine learning (ML) algorithms, including bagging and random subspace. The proposed research also fulfills the sustainable development goals (SDGs) requirement. We exploit the correlation and regression methods to understand the relationship between biophysical composition and the UHI effect. Our findings indicate that in the megacity of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from 2000 to 2021, the urban area enlarged by about 80%, while the UHI increased overall. Impervious surfaces significantly impact the UHI effect, while vegetation and water bodies have negative implications for the UHI effect. More than 80% of the total parts in Jeddah have been classified by extremely high UHI conditions, as determined by the bagging and random subspace models. In particular, the megacity's south, north, and central-east parts were categorized by very high UHI conditions. This research is not only expected to assist in understanding the spatial patterns of the UHI in Jeddah, but to assist planners and policymakers in spatial planning. It will help to ensure sustainable urban management and improve life quality.","[Addas, Abdullah] Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Alkharj 11942, Saudi Arabia; [Addas, Abdullah] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Architecture & Planning, Landscape Architecture Dept, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia",LAND,10.3390/land12061159,3,3,Yes,BDT,Saudi Arabia,Yes,UHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past 20 years, the city of Dallas, Texas, has consistently been one of the fastest growing cities in the United States and has faced rapid urbanization and great amounts of urban sprawl, leading to an increase in built-up surface area. In this study, we utilize Landsat 8 satellite images, Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, land use/land cover (LULC) data, and a state-of-the-art methodology combining machine learning algorithms (eX-treme Gradient Boosted models, or XGBoost) and a modern game theoretic-based approach (Shap-ley Additive exPlanation, or SHAP values) to investigate how different land use/land cover classi-fications impact the land surface temperature and park cooling effects in the city of Dallas.

Additionally, we have found that the extent and direction of influence of these categories depends heavily on the surrounding area. By using SHAP values we can describe these interactions in greater detail than pre-vious studies.

It statistically downscales the daily temperature extremes of 10-km ensemble forecast into 50-m resolution across Hong Kong.

However, because scholars have so far focused mainly on the magnitude of the UHI effect, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative evaluation of the relationship between urban expansion and the degree of the UHI effect from the urban agglomeration perspective. This paper analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics and the interactive mechanism of the surface urban heat island footprint (SUHI FP) in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA). The summer footprints (FPs) of 27 cities were extracted using a logistics model, and the temporal trend was estimated by a standard deviation ellipse (SDE). Furthermore, the authors used the classical machine-learning k-means algorithm to cluster the temperature attenuation curves to reveal development patterns in different cities. The results showed that the degree of FP expansion during the daytime was more apparent than at night, the area of urban growth positively correlated with a city's population level, and from 2005 to 2018 (the period of the study), the spatial evolution for all cities showed an overall trend from east to west. These cities were divided roughly into three development patterns by clustering their 2018 temperature attenuation curves.

More extreme urban heat island (UHI) effects are not distributed equally, and often impact socioeconomically vulnerable populations the most. This study aims to quantify how land surface temperature (LST) changes with increasing green vegetation landscapes, identify disparities in urban warming exposure, and provide a method for developing evidence-based mitigation options. ECOSTRESS LST products, detailed land use and land cover (LULC) classes, and socioeconomic variables were used to facilitate the analysis. We examined the relationship between LST and the fractions of LULC and socioeconomic factors in the city of Phoenix, Arizona. A machine learning approach (Random Forest) was used to model LST changes by taking the LULC fractions (scenario-based approaches) as the explanatory variables. We found that vegetation features-trees, grass, and shrubs-were the most important factors mitigating UHI effects during the summer daytime. Trees tended to lower surface temperature more effectively, whereas we observed elevated daytime LST most often near roads. Meanwhile, higher summer daytime temperatures were observed on land with unmanaged soil compared to the built environment. We found that affluent neighborhoods experienced lower temperatures, while low-income communities experienced higher temperatures. Scenario analyses suggest that replacing 50% of unmanaged soil with trees could reduce average summer daytime temperatures by 1.97 degrees C if the intervention was implemented across all of Phoenix and by 1.43 degrees C if implemented within the urban core only. We suggest that native trees requiring little to no additional water other than rainfall should be considered. We quantify mitigation options for urban warming effect under vegetation management interventions, and our results provide some vital insight into existing disparities in UHI impacts. Future UHI mitigation strategies seriously need to consider low-income communities to improve environmental justice. These can be used to guide the development of sustainable and equitable policies for vegetation management to mitigate heat exposure impacts on communities.","[Zhu, Yuanhui; Myint, Soe W.; Tong, Daoqin; Li, Yubin] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Schaffer-Smith, Danica] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; [Schaffer-Smith, Danica] Nature Conservancy, Durham, NC USA; [Muenich, Rebecca L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn, Tempe, AZ USA",FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,10.3389/fenvs.2021.795474,3,2,No,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The surface UHI (SUHI) is typically monitored with remote sensing products, whereas the air UHI (AUHI) is typically monitored using temperature sensor networks. The first technique requires clear days to obtain good images, and the latter is limited by the number of weather stations in an urban and rural area. An alternative to monitor the AUHI is the usage of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data which is available in all weather conditions and there are well-developed GNSS receiver networks around the world. In this article, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach to estimating the air temperature from GNSS data to take advantage of the quantity of data. By training a support vector regressor with three datasets, GNSS-derived zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD), temperature, and day-of-the year, we can estimate temperature from GNSS data without the need for other environmental variables. The regressor presented in this article is trained with data from 2016 to 2019 and tested with data from 2020 in five Japanese metropolitan areas. The results show that it is possible to predict temperature from only the ZTD of GNSS signals with high precision, as an R{2} between 0.82 and 0.90 is found for the predictions. Predicted temperatures are then used to study the diurnal cycle of the AUHI in Sapporo, Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka-Kyoto, and Fukuoka with an average precision of 0.8 °C. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","International Doctoral Innovation Centre, University of Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, China; National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Tokyo, Japan",IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,10.1109/tgrs.2021.3091949,4,2,No,,"China,Japan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a lack of analysis regarding the most effective methods for enhancing the cooling effect of different types of water bodies, as well as classifying the cooling effects based on parameters that affect the cooling effect. This hinders targeted optimization in urban construction. To address this gap, this study used remote-sensing data to develop a novel approach for classifying water bodies according to their actual cooling effect, and establishing a cooling effect prediction model for water bodies based on parameters that affect the cooling effect using machine learning methods. First, the cooling effect of 35 water samples from downtown Nanjing were classified by utilizing the data-mining method. Then the traditional method of classifying water bodies directly from parameters that affect the cooling effect and the classification prediction model established in this study were used to classify water bodies, respectively. It was found that the proposed classification prediction model constructed by combining unsupervised and supervised learning accurately and effectively determined the cooling effect classification of water bodies. Compared with the traditional classification method, the accuracy of the cooling effect classification by the novel approach can be improved by 1.46 times. Additionally, the study examined the correlation factors affecting the cooling effect of each class of water body and identified the most effective measures for improving the cooling effect of each class. It is noteworthy that for different classes, the most effective measures to exert the cooling effect are different. Starting from the parameters that affect the cooling effect of water bodies, this study offers targeted measures for respective water bodies to optimize their cooling density, range, and efficiency.

The current classification method does not incorporate crucial urban auxiliary GIS data on building height and imperviousness that could significantly improve urban-type LCZ classification utility as well as accuracy. This study utilized a hybrid GIS- and remote sensing imagery-based framework to systematically compare and evaluate different machine and deep learning methods. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classifier outperforms in terms of accuracy, but it requires multi-pixel input, which reduces the output's spatial resolution and creates a tradeoff between accuracy and spatial resolution. The Random Forest (RF) classifier performs best among the single-pixel classifiers. This study also shows that incorporating building height dataset improves the accuracy of the high- and mid-rise classes in the RF classifiers, whereas an imperviousness dataset improves the low-rise classes. The single-pass forward permutation test reveals that both auxiliary datasets dominate the classification accuracy in the RF classifier, while near-infrared and thermal infrared are the dominating features in the CNN classifier.

However, most current urban ET models are based on the energy balance theory to estimate urban ET. These models lead to significant errors in urban ET simulation due to the surface heterogeneity and the existence of anthropogenic heat fluxes in urban areas. To solve this issue, this study proposes a modified machine learning-based urban ET method that can estimate urban ET at the site and regional scales. To better characterize the heterogeneity of urban surfaces, the flux footprint of in-situ ET and physical mechanism of ET process are integrated into the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The modified CNN model is tested in a fast-developing city: Shenzhen, China based on two Eddy Correlation (EC) observations. The verification results indicated that coupling flux footprint and physical mechanism into the CNN model could effectively improve the accuracy of urban ET simulation at the site scale. The modified CNN model significantly reduced the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 25.8 W/m2 and increased the determination coefficient (R2) of 0.17 compared to the CNN-O model (The CNN-O model is defined as the CNN model do not integrate flux footprint and physical mechanism of ET). Further analyses suggested that fusing flux footprint data into a machine learning model helps enhance ET estimation in regions with high heterogeneity and highly variable wind directions. Moreover, the integration of physical mechanisms significantly enhanced the model capability to simulate extreme ET events. The modified CNN model is further applied to map the spatial distribution of urban ET and reconstruct long-term urban ET changes. The spatial pattern of urban ET exhibited large spatial variability, where the urban ET in water bodies (mean lambda ET larger than 480 W/m2) and vegetation-covered areas (mean lambda ET larger than 260 W/m2) are substantially higher than the impervious surfaces (mean lambda ET less than 30 W/m2). Long-term trend analyses demonstrated that urbanization resulted in decline in urban ET. The average decreasing rate of urban ET is 1.61 mm/yr (P < 0.05), with a 18 % decrease relative to the long-term ET average. The leading causes for the decline of urban ET are the increased impervious surfaces and the decreased radiation. This study improved the simulation accuracy of urban ET and revealed the response of urban ET to urbanization.","[Chen, Han; Huang, Jinhui Jeanne; Li, Han; Wei, Yizhao; Zhang, Pengwei] Nankai Univ, Sino Canada Joint R&D Ctr Water & Environm Safety, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Liang, Hong; Wang, Weimin] Natl Observat & Res Stn, Change & Comprehens Treatment Reg Ecol & Environm, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Liang, Hong; Wang, Weimin] State Environm Protect Sci Observat & Res Stn Eco, Changzhou, Peoples R China; [Liang, Hong; Wang, Weimin] Shenzhen Ecol & Environm Monitoring Ctr Guangdong, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Albert Z.] Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.129016,2,2,No,,"Peoples R China,Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) system is an initiative to standardize a classification scheme of the urban landscape, based mainly on the properties of surface structure (e.g., building, tree height, density) and surface cover (pervious vs. impervious). This approach is especially useful for studying the influence of urban morphology and fabric on the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect and to evaluate how changes in land use and structures affect thermal regulation in the city. This article will demonstrate three different methodologies of creating LCZs: first, the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT); second, using Copernicus Urban Atlas (UA) data via a geographic information system (GIS) client directly; and third via Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Oslo, Norway as the case study. The WUDAPT and GEE methods incorporate a machine learning (random forest) procedure using Landsat 8 imagery, and offer the most precision while requiring the most time and familiarity with GIS usage and satellite imagery processing. The WUDAPT method is performed principally using multiple GIS clients and image processing tools. The GEE method is somewhat quicker to perform, with work performed entirely on Googleâs sites. The UA or GIS method is performed solely via a GIS client and is a conversion of pre-existing vector data to LCZ classes via scripting. This is the quickest method of the three; however, the reclassification of the vector data determines the accuracy of the LCZs produced. Finally, as an illustration of a practical use of LCZs and to further compare the results of the three methods, we map the distribution of the temperature according to the LCZs of each method, correlating to the land surface temperature (LST) from a Landsat 8 image pertaining to a heat wave episode that occurred in Oslo in 2018. These results show, in addition to a clear LCZ-LST correspondence, that the three methods produce accurate and similar results and are all viable options.

Formation of UHI in a city should be avoided as it results in higher surface and ambient temperatures, leading to an increased demand for energy, high carbon emission and effects community health in general. Traditional ways of collecting such data is limited through weather stations, and hence such collections are limited to few parts of urban regions. With the advent of new system-on-chip based devices, wireless sensors with mobile OS communication, modern smartphones with a variety of environmental sensors, different communication modules, cloud based storage with data analysis and visualization facilities, it is now possible to develop low cost novel IoT systems to monitor, assess and analyse urban temperatures and their subsequent effects, anywhere and anytime. In this work, a location aware, mobile-sensing enabled IoT system has been designed to monitor, measure and analyse the presence and intensity of UHI effect in various geographical regions. Atmospheric temperatures have been used to predict surface temperatures. Multiple linear, quantile, support vector regression and extreme learning machine based prediction models have been evaluated for forecasting and results have been compared to examine their efficacy. The mean absolute error and the mean absolute percentage error values for the SVR model are the lowest, indicating that the SVR technique has the maximum accuracy. The mean square and the root mean square error values are the smallest for the quantile regression model, showing that the quantile regression approach produces the fewest large errors. All prediction models contain positive biases, according to the MPE values, with the quantile regression technique having the least. For training and testing, the worst-case time complexity of the multiple linear, quantile regression, and ELM models is found to be O(n), indicating that these models are faster than SVR, which has the worst-case time complexity of O(n3).

Local climate zones (LCZ) are a classification scheme for urban areas considering urban land cover characteristics and the geometry and structure of buildings, which can be used for analyzing urban heat island effect in detail. This study aimed to examine the UHI effect by urban structure in Suwon and Daegu using the LCZ scheme. First, the LCZ maps were generated using Landsat 8 images and convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning over the two cities. Then, Surface UHI (SUHI), which indicates the land surface temperature (LST) difference between urban and rural areas, was analyzed by LCZ class. The results showed that the overall accuracies of the CNN models for LCZ classification were relatively high 87.9% and 81.7% for Suwon and Daegu, respectively. In general, Daegu had higher LST for all LCZ classes than Suwon. For both cities, LST tended to increase with increasing building density with relatively low building height. For both cities, the intensity of SUHI was very high in summer regardless of LCZ classes and was also relatively high except for a few classes in spring and fall. In winter the SUHI intensity was low, resulting in negative values for many LCZ classes. This implies that UHI is very strong in summer, and some urban areas often are colder than rural areas in winter. The research findings demonstrated the applicability of the LCZ data for SUHI analysis and can provide a basis for establishing timely strategies to respond urban on-going climate change over urban areas.

The satellite image were obtained from Landsat-8 and MODIS Aqua/Terra acquired in 2019, and the meteorological ground weather data were from AWS/ASOS data of Korea Meteorological Administration and Korea Forest Service. In addition, in order to improve the estimation accuracy, a digital surface model, solar radiation, aspect and slope were used. The accuracy assessment of machine learning methods was performed by calculating the statistics of R-2 (determination coefficient) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) through 10-fold cross-validation and the estimated values were compared for each target area. As a result, the neural network algorithm showed the most stable result among the three algorithms with R-2 = 0.805 and RMSE = 0.508. The neural network algorithm was applied to each data set on Landsat imagery scene. It was possible to generate an mean air temperature map from June to September 2019 and confirmed that detailed air temperature information could be estimated.

The development of a machine learning model provides a good means of solving complex problems. This study aims to clarify the relationship between urban environmental variables and the urban thermal environment through high-precision machine learning models as well as provide scenarios of future urban thermal environment developments. We defined an urban thermal environment index (UTEI), considering twelve urban form and natural indicators sourced from the remote sensing data of 150 cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji region from 2000 to 2015. We achieved accurate predictions of UTEI through training a gradient-boosted regression trees model. By unpacking the model, we found that the contribution rate of elevation (ELEV) was the highest. Among all the urban form indicators, the elongation index (ELONG), urban population (POP), nighttime light intensity (NLI), urban area size (AREA), and urban shape index (SHAPE) also had high contributions. We set up five scenarios to simulate the possible impact of different urban form factors on the overall urban thermal environment quality in the region. Under extremely deteriorated patterns that do not control urban expansion and vegetation reduction, the average UTEI could be as high as 0.55â0.76 Â°C in summer and 0.24â0.29 Â°C in winter, yet in the extremely optimized situation, UTEI decreased by 0.69 Â°C in summer and 0.56 Â°C in winter. Results showed that better urban form improves the quality of urban environments and can provide important insights for urban planners to mitigate urban heat island problems.

The land surface temperature (LST) extracted from thermal images is a primary source of information to study UHI, characterizing the surface urban heat islands (SUHI). In addition to LST, environmental and socioeconomic variables have been adopted to explain the SUHI phenomenon. Although machine learning algorithms have potential in several areas, their application in the study of the contribution of these variables in the prediction of LST to characterize SUHI is still unknown. Therefore, the work proposes a machine learning approach to fill this gap. The LST was extracted from 15 Landsat 8 images from 2019 to 2021. Data on socioeconomic variables were obtained from the official demographic census, and environmental variables were extracted from Sentinel-2 and Planet images. Six algorithms were tested to assess the ability to estimate the LST based on the above-mentioned variables. The results showed that the Decision Tree algorithm had the best performance (r = 0.96, MAE = 1.49 °C and RMSE = 1.88 °C), followed by Random Forest. In addition, the inclusion of all seasons of the year and socioeconomic variables was shown to be relevant to the results. The main contribution of this work is to verify if the algorithms can optimize the SUHI characterization process, analyzing the influence exerted by the studied variables. In the social sphere, the information produced can help urban planning in the construction of smart cities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Post-Graduate Program of Environment and Regional Development, University of Western São Paulo, Raposo Tavares, Km 572, SP, Presidente Prudente, 19067-175, Brazil; Post-Graduate Program of Environmental Technologies, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Av.

Several studies have shown that the increasing building energy demand is associated with increased space-cooling ownership and building footprint. The energy demand is predicted to grow further with the conditions of global warming and the phenomenon of urban heat islands. Building designers have been using state-of-the-art transient simulation tools to evaluate energy-efficient envelopes with present-day weather files that are generated with historical weather datasets for any specific location. Designing buildings with historical climatic conditions makes the buildings vulnerable to the predicted climate change impacts. In this paper, a weather file generator was developed to generate Indian future weather files using a geo-filtering-based spatial technique, as well as the temporal downscaling and machine learning (ML)-based bias correction approach proposed by Belcher et al. The future weather files of the three representative concentration pathways of 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 could be generated for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, 2090, and 2100. Currently, the outputs of the second-generation Canadian Earth System Model are being used to create future weather files that will aid architects, urban designers, and planners in developing a built environment that is resilient to climate change. The novelty lies in using observed historical data from present-day weather files on the typical meteorological year for testing and training ML models. The typical meteorological weather files are composed of the concatenation of the monthly weather datasets from different years, which are referred to for testing and training ML models for bias correction. © 2022 by the authors.","Environmental Performance and Design Lab, Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, 3200003, Israel; Manipal School of Architecture and Planning, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Karnataka, Manipal, 576104, India; School of Built Environment, Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, 2052, NSW, Australia; School of Architecture and Built Environment, University of Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, WV1 1LY, United Kingdom; School of Architecture and Design, Manipal University Jaipur, Rajasthan, Jaipur, 303007, India",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su142215191,1,1,No,,"Israel,India,Australia,United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, we evaluate historical and future associations between land use land cover changes and land surface temperature in Dera Ghazi Khan–one of the top cities in Pakistan–using multi-temporal Landsat data over two decades (2002–2022). After assessing current land use changes and future predictions, their impact on land surface temperature and urban heat island effect is measured using machine learning via Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain, Artificial Neural Network and Cellular Automata. Significant changes in land use land cover were observed in the last two decades. The built-up area expanded greatly (874 ha) while agriculture land (−687 ha) and barren land (−253 ha) show decreasing trend. The water bodies were found the lowest changes (57 ha) and vegetation cover got the largest proportion in all the years. This green-grey conversion in the last two decades (8.7%) and prospect along the main corridors show the gravity of unplanned urban growth at the cost of vegetation and agricultural land (−6.8%). The land surface temperature and urban heat island effect shows a strong positive correlation between urbanization and vegetation removal. The simulation results presented in this study confirm that by 2032, the city will face a 5° C high mean temperature based on historical patterns, which could potentially lead to more challenges associated with urban heat island if no appropriate measures are taken. It is expected that due to land cover changes by 2032, ~60% of urban and peri-urban areas will experience very hot to hot temperatures (> 31.5°C). Our results provide baseline information to urban managers and planners to understand the increasing trends of land surface temperature in response to land cover changes. The study is important for urban resource management, sustainable development policies, and actions to mitigate the heat island effect. It will further asset the broader audience to understand the impact of land use land cover changes on the land surface temperature and urban heat island effect in the light of historic pattern and machine learning approach.

Obtaining high spatial resolution of air temperature at city-scale is challenging as the quantity of weather stations is often limited in cities, particularly in those less developed ones. In this study, based on the existing weather station network in Guangzhou city, China, we compare eight different air temperature predictive models and select one with the best performance to interpolate city-scale air temperature. The training and validation of the models are performed using observatory meteorological data of 321 weather stations in Guangzhou. Deep learning-derived land cover information and social-economic data are encoded to be used as explanatory variables. The regression kriging combined with multiple linear regression is found to result in the best performance, with an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.92 °C and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.959. Furthermore, the quantities and locations of current weather stations can be optimized by the proposed model. Guided by the k-means clustering alongside the information of geocoordinates and land cover, the number of current weather stations in Guangzhou can be reduced by 50% (i.e., 160 weather stations) while retaining the model performance. This study proposes and demonstrates an effective model for obtaining city-scale air temperature at high spatio-temporal resolution with data from sparse weather stations, which is much needed for cities which want to enhance their city-scale air temperature mapping by complementing new weather stations to their existing weather station network. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Center for Balance Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; International Research Center for Green Building and Low-Carbon City, International Campus, Zhejiang University, Haining, China; Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China",Building and Environment,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110211,1,1,No,,"China,Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates the impact of LU/LC class changes on LST based on the distribution of UHI spot maps in Mansoura city, Egypt, using Landsat satellite images from 1991 to 2021. Based on these estimated LU/LC and LST maps, machine learning algorithms, cellular automata, and artificial neural network approaches were used to predict future changes in LU/LC and LST for 2031. The influence of UHI may be quantified using the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). The geographic information system (GIS) add-in UHI calculator ArcGIS tool was created because we considered the spatial consequences of employing remote sensing data. This tool includes all the methods and procedures for calculating LST and UHI. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between LST and normalized difference built-up index and a negative correlation between LST and normalized difference vegetation index. The forecasted results for 2031 also show that the built-up area will grow roughly 20%, with a considerable drop in vegetation by 18%. If the city's fast urbanization continues, more than 40% of Mansoura will have land surface temperatures above 45°C by 2031. Avoiding dense built-up areas and growing vegetation spaces remain efficient means of minimizing the influence of UTFVI in urban construction practice.

Variations in thermal sensation are observed among individuals with different short-term thermal experiences, challenging the reliability of Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV) scales. This study investigates TSV disparities in Shanghai, China, between two groups: individuals with Short-Term Air Conditioning Usage Experience (STACUE) and those Lacking Short-Term Air Conditioning Usage Experience (LSTACUE). Through questionnaire surveys and environmental monitoring, the study evaluates the performances of various ensemble learning models for predicting TSV. The selected Random Forest Regressor is employed to calibrate TSV scales for Physiologically Equivalent Temperature, Standard Effective Temperature (SET*), Universal Thermal Climate Index, and Perceived Temperature. Using Shapley values from game theory, we reveal how environmental variables contribute to TSV differences among individuals with varying short-term thermal histories. Results indicate higher Thermal Unacceptable Vote and greater Environmental Expectation Vote for STACUE individuals versus LSTACUE ones. Calibrated TSV scales, particularly SET*, exhibit significant enhancements over original scales: a 35.04 % increase in prediction accuracy percentage and a 0.57 correlation increase. Explainable analysis underscores that air temperature (28.8%) has a stronger impact on TSV among STACUE individuals, whereas mean radiant temperature (32.2%) is the primary factor affecting TSV among LSTACUE.

However, existing UBEM systems routinely neglect microclimate effects on building energy consumption, potentially leading to major sources of error. In this work, we attempt to address these sources of error by proposing the large scale collection of remote sensing and climate modeling data to improve the capabilities of existing systems. We explore situations when remote sensing might be most valuable, particularly when high quality weather station data might not be available. We show that lack of access to weather station data is unlikely to be driving existing errors in energy models, as most buildings are likely to be close enough to collect high quality data. We also highlight the significance of Landsat8’s thermal instrumentation to capture pertinent temperatures for the buildings through feature importance visualizations. Our analysis then characterizes the seasonal benefits of microclimate data for energy prediction. Landsat8 is found to provide a potential benefit of an 8% reduction in electricity prediction error in the spring and summertime of New York City. In contrast, NOAA RTMA may provide a benefit of a 2.5% reduction in natural gas prediction error in the winter and spring. Finally, we explore the potential of remote sensing to enhance the quality of energy predictions at a neighborhood level. We show that benefits for individual buildings translates to the regional level, as we can achieve improved predictions for groups of buildings. © 2023","Stanford University, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, 94305, CA, United States",Advances in Applied Energy,10.1016/j.adapen.2023.100138,1,1,No,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher nocturnal air temperature (Tair) is associated with adverse effects on human health, higher mortality rates, and higher energy consumption. Prediction of the spatial distribution of Tair is a step toward the 'Smart City' concept, providing an early warning system for vulnerable populations. The study of the spatial distribution of urban Tair was thus far limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources. Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring Tair continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city. In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of nocturnal Tair in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and Urban Atlas, crowdsourced Tair data, and machine learning (ML) methods. Results were tested with a 'leave-one-date-out' training scheme (testingcrowd) and reference Tair data (testingref). Three ML algorithms were compared - Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Model Averaged Neural Network. The optimal model based on accuracy and computational speed is RF, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) for testingcrowd of 1.16 Â°C (R2 = 0.512) and RMSE for testingref of 1.97 Â°C (R2 = 0.581). Overall, the most important geographic information system (GIS) predictors were morphometric parameters and albedo.

Since the 1990s, Saudi Arabiaâs cities have undergone tremendous urban growth, causing urban heat islands, groundwater depletion, air pollution, loss of ecosystem services, etc. This study evaluates the variance and heterogeneity in land surface temperature (LST) because of LULC changes in Abha-Khamis Mushyet, Saudi Arabia, from 1990 to 2020. The research aims to determine the impact of urban biophysical parameters on the HighâHigh (HâH) LST cluster using geospatial, statistical, and machine learning techniques. The support vector machine (SVM) was used to map LULC. The land surface temperature (LST) has been derived using the mono-window algorithm (MWA). The local indicator of spatial associations (LISA) model was implemented on the spatiotemporal LST maps to identify LST clusters. Also, the parallel coordinate plot (PCP) approach was employed to examine the relationship between LST clusters and urban biophysical variables as a proxy of LULC. LULC maps show that urban areas rose by > 330% between 1990 and 2020. Built-up areas had an 83.6% transitional probability between 1990 and 2020. In addition, vegetation and agricultural land have been transformed into built-up areas by 17.9% and 21.8% respectively between 1990 and 2020. Uneven LULC changes in terms of built-up areas lead to increased LST hotspots. High normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) was linked to LST hotspots but not normalized difference water index (NDWI) or normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

The surface UHI (SUHI) is typically monitored with remote sensing products, whereas the air UHI (AUHI) is typically monitored using temperature sensor networks. The first technique requires clear days to obtain good images, and the latter is limited by the number of weather stations in an urban and rural area. An alternative to monitor the AUHI is the usage of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data which is available in all weather conditions and there are well-developed GNSS receiver networks around the world. In this article, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach to estimating the air temperature from GNSS data to take advantage of the quantity of data. By training a support vector regressor with three datasets, GNSS-derived zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD), temperature, and day-of-the year, we can estimate temperature from GNSS data without the need for other environmental variables. The regressor presented in this article is trained with data from 2016 to 2019 and tested with data from 2020 in five Japanese metropolitan areas. The results show that it is possible to predict temperature from only the ZTD of GNSS signals with high precision, as an R{2} between 0.82 and 0.90 is found for the predictions. Predicted temperatures are then used to study the diurnal cycle of the AUHI in Sapporo, Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka-Kyoto, and Fukuoka with an average precision of 0.8 Â°C.

Remote sensing (RS)- and deep learning (DL)-based classification approaches play a significant role by providing the potential for global mapping. However, most of the efforts only focus on one of the two schemes, usually on a specific scale. This leads to unnecessary redundancies since the learned features could be leveraged for both of these related tasks. In this letter, the concept of multitask learning (MTL) is introduced to HSE regression and LCZ classification for the first time. We propose an MTL framework and develop an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN), which consists of a backbone network for shared feature learning, attention modules for task-specific feature learning, and a weighting strategy for balancing the two tasks. We additionally propose to exploit HSE predictions as a prior for LCZ classification to enhance the accuracy. The MTL approach was extensively tested with Sentinel-2 data of 13 cities across the world. The results demonstrate that the framework is able to provide a competitive solution for both tasks.

Therefore, it is a key morphological parameter to study the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Studies have shown that SVF has a strong relationship with UHI intensity. Nevertheless, the relationships found can be contradictory. This is primarily due to the fact that the cases studied are often in different regions with different climatic conditions. In addition, the influences of trees are sometimes ignored due to the lack of vegetation data or the limitation of calculating methods. How to calculate SVF quickly and accurately is important to urban climate research. SVF is typically calculated by four types of methods: fisheye photo methods, 3D GIS methods, GPS methods, and street view image methods. Compared with the other types of methods, calculating SVF using street view images has many advantages, such as widely available data, low cost, high efficiency, and the ability to consider the influences of trees and other obstacles. On the one hand, street view images provide the possibility for fast and accurate calculation of SVF in large-scale areas. On the other hand, the street view image method is still at its developing stage and more work needs to be done to verify its application in various urban environments. In this study, we proposed an automatic SVF calculation method using street view images and deep learning algorithms, and then applied the method to the UHI study in the city center of Shanghai. Baidu static panoramas and Deeplabv3+ were used to detect sky range while MATLAB code was written to calculate SVF. A Landsat-8 OLI / TIRS image was also used to retrieve land surface temperature at street level in the study area. Based on the Local Climate Zones (LCZ) scheme, we combined large-scale SVF value with the land use and building morphology to examine the relationship between SVF and UHI intensity. The results showed that Deeplabv3+ can detect the sky and non-sky range effectively in different scenarios (MIOU=91.64%). The SVF calculated using the proposed method was in good agreement with that calculated using fish-eye photos (R2=0.8869). The LCZ scheme provides new insights for the relationship between SVF and UHI. For LCZ5 and LCZ1, the highest correlation coefficients were 0.68 and -0.79, respectively. The proposed method was shown to be applicable in high-density and complex urban environments. In addition, the calculation of large-scale continuous SVF provides the possibility for zonal understandings of the UHI effect based on the LCZ scheme. 2021, Science Press.

The DL model uses an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer to generate HR information from LR data, with adversarial training applied to improve physical consistency. The DL model reduces temperature errors significantly over urbanized areas present in the LR simulation, while also demonstrating considerable skill in capturing the magnitude and location of heat stress indicators.

This paper presents a novel approach to derive LST estimates by integrating machine learning algorithm and spatiotemporal fusion model at high spatial and temporal resolution. The spatial resolutions of Landsat TM and Landsat 8 LST data were first downscaled using random forest (RF) algorithm from 120 m and 100 m, respectively, to 30 m. The resultant LST data were fused with MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data, by means of the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion method (FSDAF), in order to generate high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST data covering the center of Chengdu city in China. The proposed new method was used to estimate the spatiotemporal variations of the summer daytime SUHI from 2009 to 2018 over Chengdu city. Results show that: (1) RF performs way better than the classical downscaling algorithm-thermal sharpening algorithm (TsHARP) for LST, and produces higher accuracy for different land covers; (2) the fused high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST values were evaluated with in situ LST obtained from Chengdu Meteorological Office and the final validation results indicated that the proposed method, in generating LST dataset, can provide more details of urban thermal environment and produce higher accuracy than the traditional FSDAF; (3) significantly increasing trends of summer daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) in the study area were observed.

This study estimated the AH in seven typical Chinese cities based on a remote sensing surface energy balance model (AHseb) and an energy consumption inventory-machine learning model (AHinv). The intensity of the surface UHI was extracted using land surface temperatures, and then the linear mixed-effects model and geographic detectors were used to analyze the driving effect of AH on the UHI. Despite the similar shapes of the spatial profile curves, the AH derived from the two models differed in both temporal and spatial characteristics, which was more typical in winter and in urban centers, and AHinv had a more notable central spread feature than AHseb. The AH driving effects on UHI were notably influenced by spatial and temporal heterogeneity, particularly in regions with distinct background climates. However, after controlling for the random effects of the background climate, AH still exhibited a considerable enhancing effect on the UHI. AHseb outperformed AHinv in terms of linear positive correlation and interpretation rate for UHI. Meanwhile, interactions with other potential factors enhanced AH driving effects. Consequently, UHI mitigation must be tailored to the local context by integrating multiple drivers, and for the heating effects of AH, it is necessary to develop specific mitigation measures by limiting the conversion of AHinv to AHseb in addition to reducing the heat production. The findings offer guidance for analyzing and optimizing urban thermal climates with a focus on AH or energy consumption control. © 2023","Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Key Laboratory of Earth Observation of Hainan Province, Hainan Aerospace Information Research Institute, Sanya, 572029, China; Department of Urban and Environmental Sociology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Leipzig, D-04318, Germany",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163989,0,0,Yes,,"China,Germany",Yes,,,,,,,The ML estimates the anthropogenic heat which is later correlated to UHI derived from satellite LST.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a global assessment in temperature variation is essential. Objective: This paper is the first of its kind to propose land-use based spatial machine learning (LBSM) models for predicting highly spatial-temporal variations of wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which is a heat stress indicator used to assess thermal comfort in indoor and outdoor environments, specifically for the main island of Taiwan. Methods: To develop spatiotemporal prediction models for both the working period and noon period, we calculated the WBGT of each weather station from 2001 to 2019 using temperature, humidity, and solar radiation data. These WBGT estimations were then used as the dependent variable for developing the spatiotemporal prediction models. To enhance model performance, we used innovative approaches that combined SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values for the selection of non-linear variables, along with machine learning algorithms for model development. Results: When incorporating temperature along with other land-use/land cover predictor variables, the performance of LBSM models was excellent, with an R2 value of up to 0.99. The LBSM models explained 98% and 99% of the spatial-temporal variations in WBGT for the working and noon periods, respectively, within the complete models. In the temperature-excluded models, the explained variances were 94% and 96% for the working and noon periods, respectively. Impact: WBGT is a common method used by many organizations to access the impact of heat stress on human beings. However, limited studies have mentioned the association between WBGT and health impacts due to the absence of spatiotemporal databases. This study develops a new approach using land-use-based spatial machine learning (LBSM) models to better predict the fine spatial-temporal WBGT levels, with a 50-m × 50-m grid resolution for both working time and noontime. Our proposed methodology could be used in future studies aimed at evaluating the potential long-term loss of work productivity due to the effects of global warming or urban heat island. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Department of Safety, Health and Environmental Engineering, Ming Chi University of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Center for Environmental Sustainability and Human Health, Ming Chi University of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Geomatics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Research Center for Environmental Changes, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Atmospheric Sciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli, Taiwan; Innovation and Development Center of Sustainable Agriculture, National Chung Hsing University, Tainan, Taiwan",Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology,10.1038/s41370-023-00630-1,0,0,No,,Taiwan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We apply this methodology to two boroughs in the centre of London, UK, with the results showing good agreement with a higher-resolution model for one of the boroughs. We further demonstrate the scalability of the approach by modelling the boroughs sequentially, where the second borough was modelled at little to no additional computation cost at a loss of accuracy in the local depth-averaged temperature between 0.10 and 0.23 degrees Celsius.

The increasing density of personal weather sensors (PWSs) make them a potential rich source of data for urban climate studies that address the lack of representative urban weather observations. In our study, we demonstrate that carefully quality-checked PWS data not only improve urban climate models’ evaluation but can also serve for bias correcting their output prior to any urban climate impact studies. After simulating near-surface air temperatures over London and south-east England during the hot summer of 2018 with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and its building Effect parameterization with the building energy model (BEP–BEM) activated, we evaluated the modeled temperatures against 402 urban PWSs and showcased a heterogeneous spatial distribution of the model’s cool bias that was not captured using official weather stations only. This finding indicated a need for spatially explicit urban bias corrections of air tempera-tures, which we performed using an innovative method using machine learning to predict the models’ biases in each urban grid cell. This bias-correction technique is the first to consider that modeled urban temperatures follow a nonlinear spatially heterogeneous bias that is decorrelated from urban fraction. Our results showed that the bias correction was benefi-cial to bias correct daily minimum, daily mean, and daily maximum temperatures in the cities. We recommend that urban climate modelers further investigate the use of quality-checked PWSs for model evaluation and derive a framework for bias correction of urban climate simulations that can serve urban climate impact studies. © 2023 American Meteorological Society.","Institute of Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London, London, United Kingdom; Centre for Advanced Research Computing, University College London, London, United Kingdom; Center for Energy, Environment and Technology (CIEMAT), Madrid, Spain; School of Environmental Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada; Department of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering, University of Trento, Trento, Italy",Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology,10.1175/jamc-d-22-0142.1,0,0,No,,"United Kingdom,Spain,Canada,Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With advantages in computational speed, machine learning approaches have been increasingly applied for urban air temperature prediction. Yet the current status and limitations of machine learning applications remain largely unclear. This study critically reviews 45 articles that use machine learning for urban air temperature prediction between 2011 and 2022. By separating the studies into two groups, we find that tree-based models fit for spatial prediction and neural network models work for temporal prediction. For spatial prediction, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) varies from 0.10 to 2.60 °C, and there is no clear relationship between RMSE and spatial resolution. Prediction errors of temporal studies tend to increase with the time horizon, with an RMSE of 1.35 ± 0.60 °C (4.02 ± 0.93 °C) for 4-h (5-days) ahead prediction. We provide three key recommendations to enhance the reliability and performance of future machine learning applications: 1) reporting metadata, quality control process, and model evaluation in detail, 2) fusing the temperature data from different sources and diversifying predictor variables, and 3) improving machine learning by stacking and integration with physical-based models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong; Division of Landscape Architecture, Faculty of Architecture, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong",Urban Climate,10.1016/j.uclim.2023.101499,0,0,No,,Hong Kong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phase change materials could potentially minimise the impact of the urban heat island. There is growing interest in using phase change material (PCM) incorporated bricks for building materials and the results so far have been promising. The objective of this study was to evaluate the temperature profiles of phase change materials, develop a corresponding machine learning dataset, and design a deep learning method to predict temperature profiles from PCM variables. The phase change materials selected in this study were lauric acids, stearic acids, and paraffin wax. The normalized data was split into a training set and a test set with a ratio of 9:1. Further to this, for the purpose of training the model, the original heatmap images were resized to a dimension of 160 x 120 pixels. The mean squared error between heat maps from the test set and corresponding predictions was computed, yielding an error of 0.0465, which is consistent with the viability of the approach. This work demonstrates that deep learning models based on fully connected and convolutional layers are capable of accurately predicting heat maps from PCM variables, even when relatively small datasets are used, and therefore that they are a good place to start for authors conducting similar work. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.","Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Nottingham, Jalan Broga, Semenyih, 43500, Malaysia; School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham Malaysia, Selangor, 43500, Malaysia; School of Energy, Geoscience, Infrastructure and Society, Heriot-Watt University Malaysia, Putrajaya, 62200, Malaysia",Journal of Engineering Science and Technology,,0,0,No,,Malaysia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each LULC type influences UHI differently with changing climate, therefore knowing this impact & connection is critical. To understand such relations, long temporal studies using remote sensing data play promising role by analysing the trend with continuity over vast area. Therefore, this study is aimed at machine learning centred spatio-temporal analysis of LST and land use indices to identify their intra-urban interaction during 1991–2021 (summer) in Imola city (specifically representing small urban environment) using Landsat-5/8 imageries. It was found that LST in 2021 increased by 38.36% from 1991, whereas average Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) increased by 43.75%, associating with increased thermal stress area evaluated using ecological evaluation index. Major LULC transformations included green area into agricultural arable-land and built-up. Finally, the modelled output shows that built-up & vegetation index have strongly impacted LST. This study, help to understand the relative impact of land-use dynamics on LST at intra-urban level specifically with respect to the small urban settings.

In the last 50 years, many studies have tried to characterize the influence of urban areas on precipitation, as understanding and predicting the effect would enable its mitigation. To summarize previous investigations on the urban effect on precipitation, we review and classify the urban characteristics of studied cities and research strategies used in articles. We then analyze with machine learning the influence of these research strategies and urban characteristics on the results found by articles. Investigating over 174 experiments from 48 articles, we find that the results are mostly sensitive to the dataset type. Modeling studies and those using rain gauges and satellite data agree on an increase in precipitation caused by urban areas while studies based on radar data do not reach a consensus since many of them do not identify an effect. Also, increases in precipitation are more consensual in temperate climates than in continental climates. Future research should focus on multi-city analysis with transferable methodologies to understand the urban effect variations between cities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Sorbonne Université, CNRS, EPHE, UMR METIS, Paris, France; LATMOS/IPSL, UVSQ Université Paris-Saclay, Sorbonne Université, CNRS, Guyancourt, France",Urban Climate,10.1016/j.uclim.2023.101605,0,0,No,,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Case study: Greater Cairo, Egypt”",Google Earth Engine; Influencing factors; Machine learning; SAR data; Urban footprint mapping; Urban heat island,"Urban heat islands (UHI) represent one of the substantial human-induced challenges endangering urban livelihoods. UHI and climate change have significant interactions. Progressively rising warming tendencies are exacerbating higher temperatures in UHI regions. Using time-series data, we examined annual and seasonal day-night UHI intensity and its driving factors in Greater Cairo (GC), which is considered Egypt's megacity, between April 2021 and March 2022. Since Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) proposes unique horizons for mapping urban areas, we used SAR data and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm for urban footprint extraction in the search region. Sentinel-3 SLSTR thermal images were utilized to derive annual and seasonal day-night land surface temperatures (LST) during the research period. A spatio-temporal assessment of tropospheric NO2, SO2, CO, and aerosol concentrations was performed via the Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), MODIS, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) applications. The annual average UHI intensity was higher in Egypt's megacity during the nighttime (3.27 K) than during the daytime (0.50 K). This finding indicates that driving forces are boosting temperatures in urban regions at night. The seasonal average day-night UHI intensities have the highest values during the winter, followed by the summer. Significant influencing factors concerning UHI intensity varied between the daytime and nighttime. Moreover, NDBI, PV, NDVI, altitude, and wind speed were the driving factors that were influential during the day and at night. These results can be used to establish effective adaptation measures for combating the impacts of climatic change and UHI. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental Sciences Department, Faculty of Science, Damietta University, PO Box 34517, New Damietta City, Egypt",Urban Climate,10.1016/j.uclim.2023.101729,0,0,Yes,LR,Egypt,Yes,UHI,"UHI,LULC","LST

We estimated spatiotemporal exposure to surface air temperature and pollution (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3) at high spatiotemporal resolution (daily, 250 m) for 2018–2020 in Catalonia. Innovations include the use of TROPOMI products, a data split for remote sensing gap-filling evaluation, estimation of prediction uncertainty, and use of explainable machine learning. We compiled meteorological and air quality station measurements, climate and atmospheric composition reanalyses, remote sensing products, and other spatiotemporal data. We performed gap-filling of remotely-sensed products using Random Forest (RF) models and validated them using Out-Of-Bag (OOB) samples and a structured data split. The exposure modelling workflow consisted of: 1) PM2.5 station imputation with PM10 data; 2) quantile RF (QRF) model fitting; and 3) geostatistical residual spatial interpolation. Prediction uncertainty was estimated using QRF. SHAP values were used to examine variable importance and the fitted relationships. Model performance was assessed via nested CV at the station level. Evaluation of the gap-filling models using the structured split showed error underestimation when using OOB. Temperature models had the best performance (R2 =0.98) followed by the gaseous air pollutants (R2 =0.81 for NO2 and 0.86 for O3), while the performance of the PM2.5 and PM10 models was lower (R2 =0.57 and 0.63 respectively). Predicted exposure patterns captured urban heat island effects, dust advection events, and NO2 hotspots. SHAP values estimated a high importance of TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 columns in PM and NO2 models, and confirmed that the fitted associations conformed to prior knowledge. Our work highlights the importance of correctly validating gap-filling models and the potential of TROPOMI measurements. Moderate performance in PM models can be partly explained by the poor station coverage. Our exposure estimates can be used in epidemiological studies potentially accounting for exposure uncertainty. © 2023 The Author(s)","ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain; CIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública, Barcelona, Spain",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122501,0,0,No,,Spain,Yes,Air temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results are as follows: (1) Most parks in the province had a cooling effect with an average PCI of 1.98°C. (2) Park area was the most important factor for PCI globally, followed by the patch density inside the park, but the water-derived factors except park inner waters were not at the forefront.

In particular, extreme weather events are typically localized and so should the corresponding adaptation measures. However, climate scientists are often confronted with the difficulty of providing reliable predictions at high spatial resolutions in the order of 1 km. We propose to train a convolutional neural network model to emulate the hourly high-resolution near-surface air temperature field simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) software over a period of 18 months. The model is driven by current and past lags of coarse SEVIRI land surface temperature fields. This nowcasting application implements a downscaling of the spatial resolution of the input by about a factor of four, while establishing a correlation between current and past land surface temperature maps and the current near-surface air temperature field. The U-Net variant that is proposed in this study uses regularization to prevent over-fitting and implements a novel space-time approach, where multiple time steps are fed into the model through 3D convolution layers. Besides LST, the model also uses urban density as additional static input to be able to predict the temperature more accurately in urban areas and to improve the generalizability of the trained model. The performance of our U-Net model is assessed via comparison to an MLR benchmark (ridge regularization). The model is shown to be superior on all performance metrics. It achieves a mean absolute error of 1.36 (Formula presented.) C versus 1.49 (Formula presented.) C for benchmark (a 9% relative improvement) and a root mean square error of 1.77 (Formula presented.) C versus 1.91 (Formula presented.) C for benchmark (a 7% relative improvement). The absolute error of the model is less than 2 (Formula presented.) C for 77% of the prediction points versus 72% for the benchmark (a 7% relative improvement). The improvement over the benchmark is even more significant during extreme hot periods. We demonstrate the generalizability of the approach by testing the trained model on unseen spatial domains. © 2023 by the authors.","Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics, Fraunhoferstraße 10, Valley, 83626, Germany",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15184447,0,0,No,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the evolution of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect in Moscow over a long period and to determine the interaction between SUHIs and urban pollution islands (UPIs) using a geospatial analysis platform while optimizing vegetation classification with machine learning. Additionally, we are creating a digital database for modeling the sustainability of cities on the GEE platform using cloud computing. This study used cloud computing and remote sensing image analysis platforms for a 17-year temporal-series ecological–microclimatic assessment, which provided a sequence of values describing the ongoing process of changes in the ecological conditions of Moscow over time. Combining machine learning with the random forest algorithm (RF) improved vegetation classification accuracy while reducing computation time. The study findings demonstrated how the SUHI affected Moscow’s territory and showed the urban areas significantly impacted by this phenomenon. The locations of surface urban heat islands in Moscow and areas affected by SUHI and UPI were identified using numerical modeling of the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI).

A UHI is a city or town area exhibiting a temperature variance from its surrounding environment. Researchers employ various relative UHI parameters to model UHI data and predict temperature fluctuations. For the study area of Srinagar City, Jammu & Kashmir, India, land surface temperature (LST) data and its correlated parameters were sourced from satellite imagery. The LST data for the region were analyzed to understand the development and investigate the UHI effect and its variations. Utilizing an 8-day revisit period during the busiest season month, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite provided LST data from 2001 to 2021. To address the large dataset, which includes 16 samples of LST data per square kilometer each year measured in Kelvin (K), different machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to establish associations for UHI modeling. These clusters were then compared with established scientific categories in the study area. The long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) model, using time-series data, predicted changes in urbanized areas, vegetation cover, wetlands, and other factors.

This paper strives to identify and analyze the relationship between LULC change and LST variations in the context of urbanization. Initially, it examines the correlations between LST and variables such as vegetation, man-made structures, and agriculture, employing built-up indices within each LULC category and vegetation cover. Subsequently, it assesses the impacts of LULC change and urbanization on UHI using hot spot and urban landscape analyses.

Color pigment added roller compacted high performance concrete is a novel approach to reducing the urban heat island effect through the use of paving materials. In this study, color pigment added roller compacted concrete specimens were produced and evaluate via the machine learning algorithms. Predicting compressive strength of concrete by utilization of machine learning methods is highly preferred method by scholars and professionals since ingredients’ resources are intensive and time consuming.

Existing measurements of ambient air temperature and heat stress, however, are often insufficient to capture the intra-urban variability in heat exposure. This study provides a replicable method for modeling air temperature, humidity, and moist heat stress over the urban area of Chapel Hill while engaging citizens to collect high-temporal and spatially-resolved air temperature and humidity measurements. We use low-cost, consumer-grade sensors combined with satellite remote sensing data and machine learning to map urban air temperature and relative humidity over various land-cover classes to understand intra-urban spatial variability of ambient heat exposure at a relatively high resolution (10 m). Our findings show that individuals may be exposed to higher levels of air temperature and moist heat stress than weather station data suggest, and that the ambient heat exposure varies according to land cover type, with tree-covered land the coolest and built-up areas the warmest, and time of day, with higher air temperatures observed during the early afternoon.

Accurately monitoring the spatiotemporal variations and understanding controls of SUHI were essential to propose effective mitigation measurements. However, SUHI grades across global cities remained unknown, which cloud greatly support for global mitigations. Additionally, quantitative evaluating factor weights for different SUHI indicators and grades worldwide remained further investigations. Therefore, this paper proposed SUHI grading based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and further quantified factor weights for different indicators and grades based on an interoperable machine learning named TabNet. There were three major findings. (1) Global cities were grouped into five grades, including SUCI (surface urban cool island), insignificant, low-value, medium-value, and high-value SUHI grades, indicating significant differences among different grades. SUHI grades showed significant climate-based variations, wherein the arid climate was dominated by the SUCI grade at daytime but the high-value grade at nighttime. (2) Vegetation difference was an important factor for daytime SUHII accounting for 27%. Daytime frequency of SUHI was controlled by vegetation difference, temperature, evaporation and nighttime light, accounting for 78%. The major factors for nighttime frequency were albedo differences and nighttime light, accounting for 45%. (3) Related factors contributed differently to various SUHI grades. The weight of oEVI for daytime SUHII gradually increased with grades, while it for daytime frequency and maximum duration of SUHI decreased with grades. The nighttime SUHII of the low-value grade was greatly affected by the background climate, while that of the medium-value and high-value grades were strongly impacted by anthropogenic heat flux. The diurnal contrast of grades and coupling effects with heat wave were further discussed.

Urban street greening can achieve this mitigation and improve the quality of urban spaces and people's welfare. However, a clear definition of street green space morphology is lacking, and the nonlinear mechanism of its cooling effect is still unclear; the interaction between street green space morphology and the surrounding built environment has not been investigated. This study used machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision methods to predict land surface temperature based on street green space morphology and the surrounding built environment. The performances of the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models were then compared, and the nonlinear cooling effects offered by the street green space morphology were analyzed using the Shapley method. The results show that streets with a high level of green environment exposure (GVI > 0.4, NDVI > 4) can accommodate more types of green space morphology while maintaining the cooling effect. Additionally, the proportion of vegetation with simple geometry (FI < 0.2), large leaves (FD < 0.65), light-colored leaves (CSI > 13), and high leaf density (TDE > 3) should be increased in streets with a low level of green environment exposure (GVI < 0.1, NDVI < 2.5). Meanwhile, streets with highly variable building heights (AFI > 1.5) or large areas covered by buildings (BC > 0.3) should increase large leaf vegetation (FD < 0.65) while decreasing dark leaf vegetation (CSI < 13). The study uses machine learning methods to construct a nonlinear cooling benefit model for street green space morphology, proposes design recommendations for different street green spaces that consider climate adaptation, and provides a reference for urban thermal environment regulation.","[Liu, Ziyi; Ma, Xinyao; Hu, Lihui; Liu, Yong; Lu, Shan; Chen, Huilin] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Tan, Zhe] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China",LAND,10.3390/land11122220,0,0,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, urban tree planting initiatives do not typically utilize data about both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the tree canopy, despite height being a critical determinant of the quality and value of urban canopy cover. We present a novel pipeline that uses airborne LiDAR data to train a multi-task machine learning model to generate estimates of both canopy cover and height in urban areas. We apply this to multi-source multi-spectral imagery for the case study of Chicago, USA. Our results indicate that a multi-task UNet convolutional neural network can be used to generate reliable estimates of canopy cover and height from aerial and satellite imagery. We then use these canopy estimates to allocate 75,000 trees from Chicago's recent green initiative under four scenarios, minimizing the urban heat island effect and then optimizing for an equitable canopy distribution, comparing results when only canopy cover is used, and when both canopy cover and height are considered. Through the introduction of this novel pipeline, we show that including canopy height within decision-making processes allows the distribution of new trees to be optimised to further reduce the urban heat island effect in localities where trees have the highest cooling potential and allows trees to be more equitably distributed to communities with lower quality canopies.","[Francis, John; Law, Stephen] Alan Turing Inst, London NW1 2DB, England; [Disney, Mathias; Law, Stephen] UCL, Dept Geog, London, England",URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128115,0,0,No,,England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the response of urban evapotranspiration (ETu) to these altered urban landscape patterns remains unclear. This study proposes a hybrid ETu model that combines physics processes and machine learning to evaluate trends and drivers of ETu across 480 cities in China. The results indicate that the long-term average ETu across the 480 cities is 508 mm, and the average rate of decline in ETu (DRETu) across the 480 cities is 2.19 mm/year. DRETu exhibits a positive correlation with the increasing rate of urban aridity index (AI) and fractional impermeable surface coverage (fi). The decrease in ETu is primarily caused by the altered urban landscape patterns, which include: 1) reductions in urban vegetation and water body areas resulting from urbanization; and 2) the substitution of natural forest land with landscape grasslands in urban areas. We further investigated the correlation between the urban heat island (UHI) effect and ETu and found that the intensified UHI effect is caused by an increased dif-ference in ETu between the main urban area and the suburbs. The results of this study emphasize the significance of constructing water bodies and green infrastructure in the central urban area, as well as restoring natural forests, to enhance the thermal comfort of the urban environment.","[Chen, Han; Wei, Yizhao; Huang, Jinhui Jeanne] Nankai Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Sino Canada Joint R&D Ctr Water& Environm Safety, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jinhui Jeanne] Nankai Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130296,0,0,No,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Islam-abad, one of South Asia's green and environment-friendly capitals, has experienced major Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes over the past three decades consequently, elevating the seasonal and annual Land Surface Temperature (LST) in planned and unplanned urban areas. The focus of this study was to quantify the fluctuations in LULC and LST in planned and unplanned urban areas using Landsat data and Machine Learning algorithms involving the Support Vector Machine (SVM) over the 1990-2020 data period. Moreover, hybrid Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Mar-kov) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were employed to project the future changes in LULC and annual LST, respectively, for the years 2035 and 2050. The findings of the study reveal a distinct difference in seasonal and annual LST in planned and unplanned areas. Results showed an increase of-22 % in the built-up area but vegetation and bare soil decreased by-10 % and-12 %, respectively. Built-up land showed a maximum annual mean LST followed by bare-soil and vegetative surfaces. Seasonal analysis showed that summer months experience the highest LST, followed by spring, autumn and winter. Future projections revealed that the built-up areas (-27 % in 2020) are likely to increase to-37 % and-50 %, and the areas under the highest annual mean LST class i.e., >= 28 degrees C are likely to increase to-19 % and-21 % in planned, and-38 % and-42 % in unplanned urban areas for the years 2035 and 2050, respectively. Planned areas have better temperature control with urban green spaces, and controlled infrastructure. The Capital Development Authority of Islamabad may be advised to control the expansion of built-up areas, grow urban forests, and thus mitigate the possible Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect.","[Khan, Mudassir; Farooqi, Abida] Quaid I Azam Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Qasim, Muhammad] Univ Swat, Dept Environm & Conservat Sci, Swat, Pakistan; [Tahir, Adnan Ahmad] COMSATS Univ Islamabad CUI, Dept Environm Sci, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad 22060, Pakistan",HELIYON,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e23043,0,0,,,Pakistan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the lack of in-depth understanding of the relationship between E-UHI and surface structural synergy, few studies explored the causes and mitigation measures of E-UHI. Therefore, this study accordingly defined the E-UHI effect at a finer scale based on the thermal characteristics and human thermal perceptions, and a multi-indicator' method based on machine learning was proposed to quantify internal causes and collaborative mitigation measures. The results revealed that the average E-UHI scale shows a quadratic growth in Wu'an. Artificial heat from production space (PS) is the main cause of E-UHI formation. The synergy between green space (GS), PS and shape of industrial land determines the development of E-UHI. Although both the decrease of PS and the increase of GS are ways to mitigate high land surface temperature, when PS is higher than 50%, the cooling effect of GS is not obvious. When GS is less than 2.5%, the adjustment of PS is invalid for improving the thermal environment. For mitigating E-UHI, a factory with high PS needs to increase its shape index. The synergy between the structural indicators is a novel model to solve the shortcoming of adjusting a single factor in mitigating complex E-UHI. The results provide theoretical guidance for mitigating E-UHIs.","[Liu, Shidong; Zhang, Jianjun; Wu, Xia; Chen, Wei; Liang, Sen; Zhang, Yaping; Fu, Su] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shidong; Wang, Ke] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shidong; Wang, Ke] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianjun] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Land Consolidat & Rehabil, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111216,0,0,No,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, factors like cloud contamination have led to invalid values in the LST product, which has restricted the application of the LST dataset. Therefore, the reconstruction of LST products is challenging, and it is attracting widespread attention. This study compared the performance of different algorithms (XGBoost, GBDT, RF, POLY, MLR) and different training sets (using only good-quality pixels or using both good-quality and other-quality pixels) in the estimation of missing pixels in the LST data, obtaining a seamless daily 1 km LST dataset of MODIS Terra-day, Aqua-day, Terra-night, and Aqua-night data for Zhejiang Province and its surrounding areas from 2000 to 2022. The results demonstrated that the performance of machine-learning models is significantly better than that of linear models, and among the five models, XGBoost performed the best, with an RMSE of less than 1 degrees C. The Wilcoxon test between the reconstructed LST and the true LST values revealed that including both good-quality and other-quality pixels for reconstruction resulted in a 33% increase in the number of days with non-significant differences compared with using only good-quality pixels. Moreover, the reconstructed nighttime LST has a lower RMSE compared with the reconstructed daytime LST, and the RMSE of the reconstructed LST on the Terra satellite is lower than the RMSE of the reconstructed LST on the Aqua satellite. The RMSEs for the reconstructed LSTs are 0.50 degrees C, 0.61 degrees C, 0.36 degrees C, and 0.39 degrees C, corresponding to Terra-day, Aqua-day, Terra-night, and Aqua-night for images with coverage reaching 70%, 0.65 degrees C, 0.83 degrees C, 0.49 degrees C, respectively, and 0.52 degrees C for images with coverage less than 70%. The accuracy of the reconstructed LSTs using our proposed framework outperforms the existing reconstruction methods. The 1 km daily seamless LST products can be applied in various fields, such as air temperature estimation, climate change, urban heat island, and crop temperature stress monitoring.","[Xiao, Yuanjun; Li, Shengcheng; Huang, Jingfeng; Zhou, Chang] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Appl Remote Sensing & Informat Technol, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yuanjun; Li, Shengcheng; Huang, Jingfeng; Zhou, Chang] Key Lab Agr Remote Sensing & Informat Syst, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ran] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Automation, Xiasha Higher Educ Zone, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs15204982,0,0,No,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
