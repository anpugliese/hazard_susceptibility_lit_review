The efficiency of the DLNN model was estimated for the Kon Tum Province, Viet Nam, an area characterized by the presence of landslide phenomena. Nine landslide related variables, elevation, slope angle, aspect, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, soil type, distance to faults, distance to geology boundaries, lithology cover, and 1,657 landslide locations, were used so as to produce the training and validation datasets during the landslide susceptibility assessment. The Frequency Ratio method was used so as to estimate the existing relation between the landslide-related variables and the presence of landslides, assigning to each variable class a weight value. Based on the results concerning the predictive ability of the landslide related variables which was evaluated using the Information ration method, all variables were further processed since they appear as highly predictive. The learning ability of the DLNN model has been evaluated and compared with a Multi Layer Preceptron Neural Network, a Support Vector Machine, a C4.5-Decision Tree model and a Random Forest model using the training dataset, whereas the predictive performance of each model has been evaluated and compared using the validation datasets. In order to evaluate their learning and predictive capacity of each model the classification accuracy, the sensitivity, the specificity and the area under the success and predictive rate curves (AUC) were calculated. Results showed that the proposed DLNN model had a higher performance than the four benchmark models. Although DLNN has been used seldom in landslide susceptibility assessments, the study highlights that the usage of deep learning approach could be considered as a satisfactory alternative approach for landslide susceptibility mapping.

This study describes the development and validation of a spatially explicit deep learning (DL) neural network model for the prediction of landslide susceptibility. A geospatial database was generated based on 217 landslide events from the Muong Lay district (Vietnam), for which a suite of nine landslide conditioning factors was derived. The Relief-F feature selection method was employed to quantify the utility of the conditioning factors for developing the landslide predictive model. Several performance metrics demonstrated that the DL model performed well both in terms of the goodness-of-fit with the training dataset (AUC = 0.90; accuracy = 82%; RMSE = 0.36) and the ability to predict future landslides (AUC = 0.89; accuracy = 82%; RMSE = 0.38). The efficiency of the model was compared to the quadratic discriminant analysis, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, and multi-layer perceptron neural network. A comparative analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed a significant improvement of landslide prediction using the spatially explicit DL model over these other models.

Originally, most of those maps were generated by the judgements of experts, which is time-consuming and laborious, and whose accuracy is difficult to be quantified because of the subjective effects. With the development of machine learning algorithms and the methods of data collection, big data and artificial intelligence have now been popularized in this field, significantly improving mapping accuracy and efficiency. Various machine learning-based methods, mainly including conventional machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning have been applied and compared in LSM in different areas by previous researchers. Nevertheless, none of them can be effective in all cases. Although deep learning-based methods were proven more accurate than conventional machine learning-based methods in most data-rich situations, the latter is sometimes more popularly used in LSM, as there is not that much data in this field to train a deep learning network perfectly. In a more rigorous situation when there is very limited data, transfer learning-based approaches are applied by several researchers, which have contributed to improve the workability and the accuracy of LSM in data-limited areas. Such technical explosion has promoted the application of landslide susceptibility maps, thus contributing to mitigating the social-eco impact associated with landslides. This paper comprehensively reviews the whole process of generating landslide susceptibility maps based on machine learning methods, introduces and compares the commonly used machine learning methods, and discusses the topics for future research. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Geological Journal,10.1002/gj.4666,37,37,"No, literature review",,,"China,India",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These landslides can be deadly to the community living downslope with their fast pace, turning failures into catastrophic debris flows and avalanches. Active tectonics coupled with rugged topography in a complex geoenvironment multiplies this likelihood. The available hazard maps are usually helpful in mitigating disasters. However, fool-proof predicting landslide susceptibility identification remains a challenge in landslide discipline. Recently, ensemble machine learning (ML) techniques have proved the potential to provide a more accurate and efficient solution in spatial modeling. The main purposes of the current study are to examine and evaluate the predictive capability of support vector machine hybrid ensemble ML algorithms, i.e., the bagging, boosting, and stacking for modeling the catastrophic rainfall-induced landslide occurrences in the Northern parts of Kyushu Island, at the watershed scale in Japan. In this study, a landslide inventory map containing 265 landslide polygons was first interpreted from the aerial photographs and fieldwork after the September 2017 rainfall event. The raw data were randomly separated into two parts using a 70/30 sampling strategy for training and validating the landslide models. Then, 13 predisposing factors were prepared as predictors and dependent variable. The landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) were validated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results of validation showed that the AUC values of the four models (SVM-Stacking, SVM, SVM-Bagging, and SVM-Boosting)Â varied from 0.74 to 0.91. The SVM-boosting model outperformed the other models, while SVM-stacking model has found to be the lowest performance. The outcome suggests that an ensemble ML model does not necessarily mean good performance. It is always preferable to select an appropriate model, such as the one proposed the hybrid novel ensemble SVM-boosting model, which could significantly improve the accuracies of LSM. Also, from Information Gain Ratio (IGR)Â we found that the rainfall factor mainly affects the results, that agrees with the analogy of present study.

A total of 219 slide inventories and 17 slide conditioning variables were obtained for modelling. The data showed a complex scenario. Some past slides have spread over steep lands, while others have spread through flat terrain. Random forest (RF) served to keep only important factors for further analysis as a pre-processing measure. To select CNN hyperparameters, Bayesian optimization was used. Three methods contributed to overcoming the overfitting issue owing to small training data in our research. The selection of key factors by RF helped first of all to reduce information dimensionality. Second, the CNN model with 1D convolutions was intended to considerably decrease the number of its parameters. Third, a high rate of drop-out (0.66) helped reduce the CNN parameters. Overall accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) and 5-fold cross-validation were used to evaluate the models. CNN performance was compared to ANN and SVM. CNN achieved the highest accuracy on testing dataset (83.11%) and AUROC (0.880, 0.893, using testing and 5-fold CV, respectively). Bayesian optimization enhanced CNN accuracy by~3% (compared with default configuration). CNN could outperform ANN and SVM owing to its complicated architecture and handling of spatial correlations through convolution and pooling operations. In complex situations where some variables make a non-linear contribution to the occurrence of landslides, the method suggested could thus help develop landslide susceptibility maps.

In this study, we applied two novel deep learning algorithms, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), for national-scale landslide susceptibility mapping of Iran. We prepared a dataset comprising 4069 historical landslide locations and 11 conditioning factors (altitude, slope degree, profile curvature, distance to river, aspect, plan curvature, distance to road, distance to fault, rainfall, geology and land-sue) to construct a geospatial database and divided the data into the training and the testing dataset. We then developed RNN and CNN algorithms to generate landslide susceptibility maps of Iran using the training dataset. We calculated the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and used the area under the curve (AUC) for the quantitative evaluation of the landslide susceptibility maps using the testing dataset. Better performance in both the training and testing phases was provided by the RNN algorithm (AUC ?= ?0.88) than by the CNN algorithm (AUC ?= ?0.85). Finally, we calculated areas of susceptibility for each province and found that 6% and 14% of the land area of Iran is very highly and highly susceptible to future landslide events, respectively, with the highest susceptibility in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province (33.8%).

Deep learning methods can exploit low-level features and high-level representations of information from environmental factors. In this paper, a novel deep learningâbased algorithm, the fully connected spare autoencoder (FC-SAE), is proposed for LSP. The FC-SAE consists of four steps: raw feature dropout in input layers, a sparse feature encoder in hidden layers, sparse feature extraction in output layers, and classification and prediction. The Sinan County of Guizhou Province in China, with a total of 23,195 landslide grid cells (306 recorded landslides) and 23,195 randomly selected non-landslide grid cells, was used as study case. The frequency ratio values of 27 environmental factors were taken as the input variables of FC-SAE. All 46,390 landslide and non-landslide grid cells were randomly divided into a training dataset (70%) and a test dataset (30%). By analyzing real landslide/non-landslide data, the performances of the FC-SAE and two other conventional machine learning methods, support vector machine (SVM) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN), were compared. The results show that the prediction rate and total accuracies of the FC-SAE are 0.854 and 85.2% which are higher than those of the SVM-only (0.827 and 81.56%) and BPNN (0.819 and 80.86%), respectively.

Coupling machine learning algorithms with spatial data types for landslide susceptibility mapping is a vitally important issue. This study was carried out using GIS and R open source software at Abha Basin, Asir Region, Saudi Arabia. First, a total of 243 landslide locations were identified at Abha Basin to prepare the landslide inventory map using different data sources. All the landslide areas were randomly separated into two groups with a ratio of 70% for training and 30% for validating purposes. Twelve landslide-variables were generated for landslide susceptibility modeling, which include altitude, lithology, distance to faults, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landuse/landcover (LULC), distance to roads, slope angle, distance to streams, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope length (LS), and slope-aspect.

In this study, bivariate statistical-based kernel logistic regression (KLR) models with different kernel functions (Polynomial, PUK, and Radial Basis Function), named the PLKLR, PUKLR, and RBFKLR models, were proposed for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Zichang City, China. Meanwhile, the present study aims to build landslide susceptibility maps based on bivariate statistical correlation analysis, optimization of different kernel functions, comparison of three landslide susceptibility maps and systematic analysis of spatial patterns. The steps of this article are organized as follows: Firstly, a landslide inventory containing 263 historical landslide locations was constructed. For the purpose of training and validation of models, 263 landslide locations were randomly divided into two parts with a ratio of 70/30. Secondly, 14 landslide conditioning factors were extracted from the spatial database. Subsequently, correlation analysis between the conditioning factors and the occurrence of landslides was conducted using frequency ratios. Then, the conditioning factors with normalized frequency ratios values were used as inputs to build the landslide susceptibility maps using the three models. A multicollinearity analysis was performed using collinearity statistics. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for comparison and validation of models for recognizing the prediction capability. By further quantitative comparing mapped susceptibility values on a pixel-by-pixel basis, which can acquire underestimations and overestimations of factors (distance to river and slope) and susceptibility area. The results indicated that the PUKLR model had superior performance in landslide susceptibility assessment, with the highest AUC values of 0.884 and 0.766 for training and validation datasets, respectively. This model was followed by the RBFKLR model and the PLKLR model for the training datasets (AUC values of 0.879 and 0.797, respectively), and the PLKLR model and the RBFKLR model for the validation datasets (AUC values of 0.758 and 0.752, respectively).

The purpose of this study is to optimize the hyperparameters based on a Bayesian optimization algorithm, and to obtain a high accuracy random forest landslide susceptibility evaluation model. The research steps are detailed as follows. Firstly, taking a typical landslide prone mountainous area as an example, 16 conditioning factors, such as elevation, annual average rainfall, distance from roads, distance from buildings and so on, were preliminarily selected as the conditioning factors of landslide susceptibility. Combined with 1520 historical landslide events, a geospatial database was established with 30 m resolution. Secondly, the geospatial data sample set was constructed by random sampling according to ratio of historical landslides and non-landslides of 1:10. Based on the whole sample set, the random forest model adopted the Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters. Next, the optimal hyperparameters were selected to be trained to get the evaluation model of landslide susceptibility. In addition, they were carried out the analysis of landslide susceptibility mapping for the whole study area. After that, the recursive feature elimination method was used to screen out the dominant conditioning factors that can explain the degree of landslide susceptibility. The results indicated that the area under curve (AUC) values of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in training data set, verification data set and regional simulation were 0.95, 0.87 and 0.93, respectively. 65% of the historical landslides fell between the high susceptibility and very high susceptibility regions, which made up <20% of the research area. The model was in good agreement to the distribution characteristics of historical landslides in the study area. We noted that all the three recent landslides with impact on the study area occurred at the locations predicted by the model to have high or very high susceptibility in terms of typical landslides in the near future. As for conditioning factors, the contribution related to human activities accounted for a large proportion. In conclusion, an evaluation model with high precision for random forest landslide susceptibility can be built based on hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian optimization algorithm. Simultaneously, using recursive feature elimination method, a random forest landslide susceptibility model with fewer dominant conditioning factors and guaranteed evaluation accuracy can also be built to save the running time and input data resources of the model.

The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area of China is characterized by more prone to landslides for the rainfall and variation of reservoir level. Prediction of landslide displacement is favorable for the establishment of early geohazard warning system. Conventional machine learning methods as forecasting models often suffer gradient disappearance and explosion, or training is slow. Hence, a dynamic method for displacement prediction of the step-wise landslide is provided, which is based on gated recurrent unit (GRU) model with time series analysis. The establishment process of this method is interpreted and applied to Erdaohe landslide induced by multi-factors in TGR area: the accumulative displacements of landslide are obtained by the global positioning system; the measured accumulative displacements is decomposed into the trend and periodic displacements by moving average method; the predictive trend displacement is fitted by a cubic polynomial; and the periodic displacement is obtained by the GRU model training. And the support vector machine (SVM) model and GRU model are used as comparisons. It is verified that the proposed method can quite accurately predict the displacement of the landslide, which benefits for effective early geological hazards warning system. Moreover, the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy than the SVM model. Â© 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Natural Hazards,10.1007/s11069-020-04337-6,85,29,No,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are responsible for substantial damages and losses in those areas. The A1 Highway, which is an important road in Algeria, was sometimes constructed in mountainous and/or semi-mountainous areas. Previous studies of landslide susceptibility mapping conducted near this road using statistical and expert methods have yielded ordinary results. In this research, we are interested in how do machine learning techniques help in increasing accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps in the vicinity of the A1 Highway corridor. To do this, an important section at Ain Bouziane (NE, Algeria) is chosen as a case study to evaluate the landslide susceptibility using three different machine learning methods, namely, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and boosted regression tree (BRT). First, an inventory map and nine input factors were prepared for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) analyses. The three models were constructed to find the most susceptible areas to this phenomenon. The results were assessed by calculating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the standard error (Std. error), and the confidence interval (CI) at 95%. The RF model reached the highest predictive accuracy (AUC ?= ?97.2%) comparatively to the other models. The outcomes of this research proved that the obtained machine learning models had the ability to predict future landslide locations in this important road section. In addition, their application gives an improvement of the accuracy of LSMs near the road corridor. The machine learning models may become an important prediction tool that will identify landslide alleviation actions.

A hot research topic has been the ability to predict landslide susceptibility, which can be used to design schemes of land exploitation and urban development in mountainous areas. In this study, the teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) and satin bowerbird optimizer (SBO) algorithms were applied to optimize the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model for landslide susceptibility mapping. In the study area, 152 landslides were identified and randomly divided into two groups as training (70%) and validation (30%) dataset. Additionally, a total of fifteen landslide influencing factors were selected. The relative importance and weights of various influencing factors were determined using the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method. Finally, the comprehensive performance of the two models was validated and compared using various indexes, such as the root mean square error (RMSE), processing time, convergence, and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). The results demonstrated that the AUROC values of the ANFIS, ANFIS-TLBO and ANFIS-SBO models with the training data were 0.808, 0.785 and 0.755, respectively. In terms of the validation dataset, the ANFIS-SBO model exhibited a higher AUROC value of 0.781, while the AUROC value of the ANFIS-TLBO and ANFIS models were 0.749 and 0.681, respectively. Moreover, the ANFIS-SBO model showed lower RMSE values for the validation dataset, indicating that the SBO algorithm had a better optimization capability. Meanwhile, the processing time and convergence of the ANFIS-SBO model were far superior to those of the ANFIS-TLBO model. Therefore, both the ensemble models proposed in this paper can generate adequate results, and the ANFIS-SBO model is recommended as the more suitable model for landslide susceptibility assessment in the study area considered due to its excellent accuracy and efficiency.

This study plans to compare the prediction performance of these data-driven models on the landslide susceptibility mapping, thus further to explore the inherently features of these data-driven models. As a result, a more accurate and reliable LSP can be realized through choosing an optimal data-based model. A heuristic model represented by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a general statistical model represented by the general linear model (GLM) and information value (IV) model, and machine learning models represented by binary logistic regression (BLR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM) and C5.0 decision tree (C5.0 DT) are adopted in this study. Shicheng County in China is used as the study area. In total, 369 landslides identified through field investigation are classified as training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Next, 13 landslide conditioning factors (elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, relief amplitude, total surface radiation, population density, Normalized difference vegetation index, distance to river, topographic wetness index and rock types) are acquired from data sources of the free remote sensing images, Digital Elevation Model, field investigation and government reports. The correlations between these conditioning factors and the landslide locations are determined by frequency ratio analysis. Then, the landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs) calculated by the eight trained models are imported into GIS software to produce landslide susceptibility maps of Shicheng County. Finally, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the calculated LSIs are applied to assess the LSP performance of the present eight models.

However, new advancements in statistical and machine learning algorithms continuously being updated the landslide susceptibility paradigm. This paper explores the predictive performance power of different sampling techniques in landslide susceptibility mapping in the wake of increased usage of artificial intelligence. We used logistic regression (LR), neural network (NNET), and deep learning neural network (DNN) model for testing and validation of the models. The tests were applied to the 2018 Hokkaido Earthquake affected areas using a set of 11 predictor variables (seismic, topographic, and hydrological). We found that the prediction rates are inconsequential with the DNN model irrespective of the sampling technique (AUC: 0.904 â 0.919). Whereas, testing with LR (AUC: 0.825 â 0.785) and NNET (AUC: 0.882 â 0.858) produces larger differences in the accuracies between the four datasets. Nonetheless, the highest success rates were obtained for samples within the landslide scarp area. The analogy was then validated with a published landslide inventory from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. We, therefore, suggest that DNN models as an appropriate technique to increase the predictive performance of landslide susceptibilities if the landslide scarp and body are not characterized properly in an inventory.

First, data for 1520 historical landslides occurring was collected from field investigations and literature reviews, to construct a spatial database of 16 conditioning factors. Subsequently, the Bayesian algorithm was adopted to optimize the hyperparameters of the LR and RF models, premised on the dataset of all cells (including landslides and non-landslides). Finally, the two optimized models were estimated and compared with the area under curve (AUC) and confusion matrix. Based on the Bayesian algorithm, the AUC value of the test dataset in LR model is improved by 4%, while the AUC value of the test dataset in RF model is improved by 10%, indicating that both models' hyperparameter optimization premised on the Bayesian algorithm have delivered considerable impact on the accuracy of the models; so hyperparameter optimization is very important for models of LSM. Although both models exhibit reasonable performances, the optimized RF model premised on hyperparameter optimization has a better stability and predictive capability in case area. These findings make up for the crucial step in LSM (hyperparameter optimization) through the Bayesian algorithm, and provide a comparison case between LR and RF models after comprehensive consideration of hyperparameter optimization, so as to increase the convincing power of the comparison of these models and provide a knowledge base for model comparison: comparison premised on hyperparameter optimization.

Today, the availability of high-resolution EO data products is increasing exponentially, and one of the targets is to exploit this data source for the rapid generation of landslide inventory. Conventional methods like pixel-based and object-based machine learning strategies have been studied extensively in the last decade. In addition, recent advances in CNN (convolutional neural network), a type of deep-learning method, has been widely successful in extracting information from images and have outperformed other conventional learning methods. In the last few years, there have been only a few attempts to adapt CNN for landslide mapping. In this study, we introduce a modified U-Net model for semantic segmentation of landslides at a regional scale from EO data using ResNet34 blocks for feature extraction. We also compare this with conventional pixel-based and object-based methods. The experiment was done in Douglas County, a study area selected in the south of Portland in Oregon, USA, and landslide inventory extracted from SLIDO (Statewide Landslide Information Database of Oregon) was considered as the ground truth. Landslide mapping is an imbalanced learning problem with very limited availability of training data. Our network was trained on a combination of focal Tversky loss and cross-entropy loss functions using augmented image tiles sampled from a selected training area.

Mapping of landslide susceptibility is an important tool to prevent and control landslide disasters. The purpose of this study is to make use of a hybrid machine learning approach by combining the reduced-error pruning trees (Rept) with a series of ensemble techniques (Bagging, Dagging, and Real Adaboost) and compare the performance of each combination for landslide susceptibility modeling. The combination of Rept model and Real Adaboost (RRept)is a novel application in the field of landslide susceptibility. Firstly, a landslide inventory map was prepared with 298 determined historical landslides events in the study area, 209 landslides (70%) were randomly selected for the training dataset and the remaining 89 landslides (30%) were used for validation dataset. On this basis, 16 landslide influencing factors were included in the landslide susceptibility evaluation (slope angle, elevation, slope aspect, sediment transport index (STI), topographical wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), profile curvature, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to faults, soil, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landuse, lithology and rainfall). Secondly, the correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) method was used to select the most important factors for the proposed landslide susceptibility model. The results show that all the factors contribute to the occurrence of landslide. Slope angle, Landuse, Elevation, Distance to roads, Soil and Lithology have the greatest influence on the occurrence of landslide. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC), standard error (SE), 95% confidence interval and mean absolute error (MAE) were then used to validate and compare the performance of the model. The best model should have the largest AUC value, the smallest SE, the narrowest 95% CI and the smallest MAE. The results show that the three hybrid models perform better than the Rept model alone. For the training data set, the RRept model has highest AUC value (0.927), the smallest SE (0.121), the narrowest 95% confidence interval (0.898â0.95) and the lowest MAE (0.20). For the validation data set, the RRept model has the highest AUC value (0.745), the narrowest 95% confidence interval (0.674â0.807) and the lowest MAE (0.33). The RRept has the highest predictive power for landslide susceptibility evaluation. The results show that a hybrid method improves the prediction ability of the base Rept model. In addition, the RRept model is a promising comprehensive model that can be applied to landslide susceptibility mapping.

At first, we construct maps depicting the most effective factors on floods (12 factors), forest fires (10 factors), and landslides (10 factors), and used the Boruta algorithm to prioritize the impact of each respective factor on the occurrence of each hazard. Subsequently, flood, landslides, and forest fire susceptibility maps prepared using a Random Forest (RF) model in the R statistical software. Results indicate that 42.83% of the study area are not susceptible to any hazards, while 2.67% of the area is at risk of all three hazards. The results of the multi-hazard map in Shiraz City indicate that 25% of Shiraz city is very susceptible to flooding, while 16% is very susceptible to landslide occurrences. For four strategic watersheds, it is notable that in the Dorodzan Watershed, landslides and floods are the most important hazards; whereas, flood occurrences cover the largest area of the Maharlou Watershed. In contrast, the Tashk-Bakhtegan Watershed is so sensible to floods and landslides, respectively. Finally, in the Ghareaghaj Watershed, forest fire ranks as the strongest hazard, followed by floods. The validation results indicate an AUC of 0.834, 0.939, and 0.943 for the flood, landslide, and forest fire susceptibility maps, respectively. Also, other accuracy measures including, specificity, sensitivity, TSS, CCI, and Gini coefficient confirmed results of the AUC values.

As a result, many scientists study the phenomenon, and some of them have focused on producing landslide susceptibility maps that can be used by land-use managers to reduce injury and damage. This paper contributes to this effort by comparing the power and effectiveness of five machine learning, benchmark algorithmsâLogistic Model Tree, Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes Tree, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machineâin creating a reliable shallow landslide susceptibility map for Bijar City in Kurdistan province, Iran. Twenty conditioning factors were applied to 111 shallow landslides and tested using the One-R attribute evaluation (ORAE) technique for modeling and validation processes. The performance of the models was assessed by statistical-based indexes including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). Results indicate that all the five machine learning models performed well for shallow landslide susceptibility assessment, but the Logistic Model Tree model (AUC = 0.932) had the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, followed by the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.932), NaÃ¯ve Bayes Tree (AUC = 0.864), ANN (AUC = 0.860), and Support Vector Machine (AUC = 0.834) models. Therefore, we recommend the use of the Logistic Model Tree model in shallow landslide mapping programs in semi-arid regions to help decision makers, planners, land-use managers, and government agencies mitigate the hazard and risk.

This study focuses on detecting landslides from high-resolution optical satellite images using CNN-based methods, providing opportunities for recognizing latent landslides and updating large-scale landslide inventory with high accuracy and time efficiency. Considering the variety of landslides and complicated backgrounds, attention mechanisms originated from the human visual system are developed for boosting the CNN to extract more distinctive feature representations of landslides from backgrounds. As deep learning needs a large number of labeled data to train a learning model, we manually prepared a landslide dataset which is located in the Bijie city, China. In the dataset, 770 landslides, including rock falls, rock slides, and a few debris slides, were interpreted by geologists from the satellite images and digital elevation model (DEM) data and further checked by fieldwork. The landslide data was separated into a training set that trains the attention boosted CNN model and a testing set that evaluates the performance of the model with a ratio of 2:1. The experimental results showed that the best F1-score of landslide detection reached 96.62%. The results also proved that the performance of our spatial-channel attention mechanism was fairly over other recent attention mechanisms.

Therefore, the pertinently regional landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is of great significance for disaster prevention and mitigation. In this study, LSM is prepared by using a boosting-C5.0 decision tree model. Under the landslide verification of on-site investigations, the study area is divided into accumulation and rock areas, and a total of 12 impact factors are selected. TOL and VIF are employed to determine the multicollinearity among the impact factors. The independent training (80%) and validation (20%) datasets are constructed by random sampling for LSM. ANN, C5.0, and SVM are selected for comparative analysis. The results show that there is no rigorous multicollinearity among the impact factors proposed in this paper. The landslide susceptibility in the study area is divided into low, moderate, high, and very high. The highest susceptibility area distributes along the riverside where the landslide ratio is 37.05% in boosting-C5.0 model. Then the ROCs are expropriated to infer the accuracy of each model. The boosting-C5.0 performs the best with the largest area under the curve in both accumulation and rock areas, reaching at 0.991 and 0.990 in the validation sets, respectively. Finally, the composite modification of the 5 validation sets shows that the uncertainty of boosting-C5.0 is concentrated in the intermediate probability areas of susceptibility.

A total of 249 landslide sites have been identified to date andwere used in this study tomodel and validate the LSMs of the study region. Of the 249 landslide locations, 70% were used as training data and 30% for the validation of the resulting LSMs. Sixteen factors related to topographical, hydrological, soil type, geological and environmental conditions were used and amulti-collinearity test of the landslide conditioning factors (LCFs)was performed. Using the natural breakmethod (NBM) in a geographic information system(GIS), the LSMs generated by the RF, FLDA, and ADTreemodelswere categorized into five classes, namely very low, low, medium, high and very high landslide susceptibility (LS) zones. The very high susceptibility zones cover 15.37%(ADTree), 16.10%(FLDA) and 11.36%(RF) of the total catchment area.

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) has proven useful in designing landslide mitigation strategies for reducing disaster risk and societal and economic losses, which are essential for land use planning, hazard prevention, and risk management. Recent efforts for improving accuracies of LSM have focused on the utilization of convolutional neural network (CNN) in some image-related tasks, however, due to the inconsistency of data representation, CNN-related studies need to be further explored. In this study, a CNN-based approach for LSM was proposed and experimentally applied in a Jiuzhaigou region where a catastrophic earthquake taken place on 8 August 2017, in Sichuan, China. To address the issue of data representation in the CNN model, we proposed a multiscale sampling strategy which to our knowledge is novel in LSM. In this way, the multiscale training samples (i.e., small scale, medium scale and large scale) were generated from the selected eleven landslide causative factors. The success-rate curve (SRC) and prediction-rate curve (PRC) were applied to validate the LSM results, and three conventional machine learning algorithms, i.e., logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and radial basis function (RBF) neural network, were attempted for comparison. Specifically, MLP neural network achieved the best performance among three machine learning methods, with the area under the SRC (AU-SRC) and PRC (AU-PRC) values of 81.18% and 82.84%, respectively. Nevertheless, the AU-SRC and AU-PRC values of CNN-based approach reached to 97.45% and 88.02%, which were about 16% and 6% higher than that of the MLP neural network, respectively. The present study demonstrated both the excellent goodness-of-fit and strong prediction ability of CNN-based approach for LSM, which also showed the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed multiscale sampling strategy. Additionally, present study revealed that the spatial data close to the landslide location might be more suitable to predict the probability of the landslide occurrence. Finally, we expect that the deep learning method based on multiscale data representation will advance our ability to assess the landslide susceptibility and raise the awareness of landslide disasters.

Four different Ensemble techniques were applied, after the averaging of 300 stand-alone methods, each one providing validation scores such as ROC (receiver operating characteristics)/AUC (area under curve) and true skill statistics (TSS). A further model performance evaluation was achieved by assessing the uncertainty through the computation of the coefficient of variation (CV). Ensemble modelling thus showed improved reliability, testified by the higher scores, by the low values of CV and finally by a general consistency between the four Ensemble models adopted.

Firstly, we selected different regions in typical mountainous hilly region and constructed a geospatial database containing 12 landslide influencing factors such as elevation, annual average rainfall, slope, lithology, and NDVI through field surveys, satellite images, and a literature review. Subsequently, the landslide susceptibility evaluation model was constructed based on the XGBoost algorithm and spatial database, and the prediction results of the landslide susceptibility evaluation model were explained based on regional topography, geology, and hydrology using the SHAP algorithm. Finally, the model was generalized and applied to regions with both similar and very different topography, geology, meteorology, and vegetation, to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the generalizability of the model. The following conclusions were drawn: the spatial distribution of landslides is heterogeneous and complex, and the contribution of each influencing factor on the occurrence of landslides has obvious regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity. The generalizability of the landslide susceptibility evaluation model is spatially heterogeneous and has better generalizability to regions with similar regional characteristics. Further explanation of the XGBoost landslide susceptibility evaluation model using the SHAP method allows quantitative analysis of the differences in how much various factors contribute to disasters due to spatial heterogeneity, from the perspective of global and local evaluation units. In summary, the integrated explanatory framework based on the SHAP-XGBoost model can quantify the contribution of influencing factors on landslide occurrence at both global and local levels, which is conducive to the construction and improvement of the influencing factor system of landslide susceptibility in different regions.

The main aim of the current research was to develop landslide susceptibility maps for Icheon Township, South Korea, using hybrid Machin learning and metaheuristic algorithms, that is, the bee algorithm (Bee), the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), and the grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and to compare their predictive accuracy. Based on identified landslide locations, an inventory map was prepared and divided into training and validation data sets (70%/30%). the predicated model outcomes were validated with root mean square error (RMSE), and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and pairwise comparison values for the ANFIS, ANFISâBee, ANFISâGWO, SVR, SVRâBee, and SVRâGWO models were obtained. The area under the curve was obtained with the training and validation data sets. Based on the training data sets, AUC of 80%, 83%, 83%, 69%, 81%, and 80% were obtained for the SVR, SVRâGWO, SVRâBee, ANFIS, ANFISâGWO, and ANFISâBee models, respectively. For the validation data sets, values of 79%, 82%, 82%, 68%, 79%, and 79%, respectively, were obtained. The SVRâGWO and SVRâBee models were the most predictive models in terms of constructing the exceptionally focused landslide susceptibility map, with little spatial variation in the highly susceptible classes. Furthermore, the MSE, RMSE, and pairwise comparisons indicated that the SVRâGWO and SVRâBee models were superior models for this study township. In addition, ANFIS individually was not superior to the ensembles of ANFISâGWO and ANFISâBee for landslide assessment. These landslide susceptibility maps provide a platform for land use planning with an eye toward sustainable development of infrastructure and damage reduction for Icheon Township.

For this regard, set of ten influencing factors (slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, landuse, distance to road, distance to river, soil type, distance to fault, and lithology) and 193 landslide polygons were prepared to construct a Geographic Information System (GIS) database for the study area.

However, comparisons of the applications of ML models for LSP from the perspectives of supervised machine learning (SML) and unsupervised machine learning (USML) have not been explored. Hence, this study aims to compare the LSP performance of these SML and USML models, thus further to explore the advantages and disadvantages of these ML models and to realize a more accurate and reliable LSP result. Two representative SML models (support vector machine (SVM) and CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) and two representative USML models (K-means and Kohonen models) are respectively used to scientifically predict the landslide susceptibility indexes, and then these prediction results are discussed. Ningdu County with 446 recorded landslides obtained through field investigations is introduced as case study. A total of 12 conditioning factors are obtained through procession of Landsat TM 8 images and high-resolution aerial images, topographical and hydrological spatial analysis of Digital Elevation Modeling in GIS software, and government reports. The area value under the curve of receiver operating features (AUC) is applied for evaluating the prediction accuracy of SML models, and the frequency ratio (FR) accuracy is then introduced to compare the remarkable prediction performance differences between SML and USML models. Overall, the receiver operation curve (ROC) results show that the AUC of the SVM is 0.892 and is slightly greater than the AUC of the CHAID model (0.872). The FR accuracy results show that the SVM model has the highest accuracy for LSP (77.80%), followed by the CHAID model (74.50%), the Kohonen model (72.8%) and the K-means model (69.7%), which indicates that the SML models can reach considerably better prediction capability than the USML models. It can be concluded that selecting recorded landslides as prior knowledge to train and test the LSP models is the key reason for the higher prediction accuracy of the SML models, while the lack of a priori knowledge and target guidance is an important reason for the low LSP accuracy of the USML models. Nevertheless, the USML models can also be used to implement LSP due to their advantages of efficient modeling processes, dimensionality reduction and strong scalability.

This study presents a novel framework for studying the uncertainty of non-landslide samples selection on the LSP results through the slope unit-based machine learning models. In this framework, the non-landslide samples are randomly selected from the non-landslide areas by multiple times (N = 1, 10, 100, 500, 1000, 5000) to construct LSP models and calculate N types of landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs). Afterwards, the statistical analysis is used to represent the uncertainty of LSIs under each non-landslide selection. The maximum probability analysis (MPA) is applied to reduce the uncertainty of non-landslide samples selection in LSP, which calculates the probability of N types of LSIs falling into very high, high, moderate, low and very low landslide susceptibility levels and selects the optimal landslide susceptibility level with the highest probability for each slope unit. Chongyi County in China is selected as the example, slope unit-based logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) models are constructed with 16 conditioning factors. The area under the receiver operating features curve (AUC) and frequency ratio (FR) accuracy are used to evaluate the LSP performance. Results show that the N types of LSIs in each slope unit exhibit a normal distribution rather than one constant value. The uncertainties of LSIs caused by non-landslide samples selection are well represented by statistical analysis. The AUC values of slope unit-based LR/SVM models range from 0.714/ 0.711 (N = 1) to 0.787/0.775 (N = 5000) and increase to 0.867/0.848, meanwhile, the FR accuracies range from 0.772/ 0.763 (N = 1) to 0.815/0.826 (N = 5000) and increase to 0.843/0.861 by the MPA method.

Till now, visual interpretation and field survey are still the most widely adopted techniques for landslide mapping, which are often criticized labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, deep-learning-based approach for landslide detection and mapping has drawn great attention for its significant advantages over the traditional techniques. However, lack of sufficient training samples has constrained the application of deep-learning-based approach in landslide detection from satellite images for a long time. The present study aimed to examine the feasibility of a new deep-learning-based approach to intelligently detect and map earthquake-triggered landslides from singleoral RapidEye satellite images. Specifically, the proposed approach consists of three steps. First of all, a standard data preprocessing workflow to automatically generate training samples was designed and some data augmentation strategies were implemented to alleviate the lack of training samples. Then, a cascaded end-to-end deep learning network, namely LandsNet, was constructed to learn various features of landslides. Finally, the identified landslide maps were further optimized with morphological processing. Experiments in two spatially independent earthquake-affected regions showed our proposed approach yielded the best F1 value of about 86.89%, which was about 7% and 8% higher than that obtained by ResUNet and DeepUNet, respectively. Comparative studies on the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach with ResUNet and DeepUNet demonstrated its strong application potentials in the emergency response of natural disasters. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,10.1109/jstars.2020.3028855,65,17,No,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past decades, due to inflation of urbanized area and climate change, a compelling expansion in landslide prevalence took place which is also termed as mass/slope movement and mass wasting, causing extensive collapse around the world. The principal reason for its pursuance is a reduction in the internal resistance of soil and rocks, classified as a slide, topple, fall, and flow. Slopes can be differentiated based on earth material and the nature of its movements. The downward flow of landslides occurs due to excessive rainfall, snowmelt, earthquake, volcanic eruption, and so on. This review article revisits the conventional approaches for identification of landslides, predicting future risk, associated with slope failures, followed by emphasizing the advantages of modern geospatial techniques such as aerial photogrammetry, satellite remote sensing images (ie, panchromatic, multispectral, radar images), Terrestrial laser scanning, and High-Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HR-DEM) in updating landslide inventory maps. Machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machine, Artificial neural network, deep learning has been extensively used with geographical data producing effective results for assessment of natural hazard/resources and environmental research. Based on recent studies, deep learning is a reliable tool addressing remote sensing challenges such as trade-off in imaging system producing poor quality investigation, in addition, to expedite consequent task such as image recognition, object detection, classification, and so on. Conventional methods, like pixel and object-based machine learning methods, have been broadly explored. Advanced development in deep learning technique like CNN (Convolutional neural network) has been extensively successful in information extraction from an image and has exceeded other traditional approaches. Over the past few years, minor attempts have been made for landslide susceptibility mapping using CNN. In addition, small sample sizes for training purpose will be major drawback and notably remarkable while using deep learning techniques. Also, assessment of the model's performance with diverse training and testing proportion other than commonly utilized ratio, that is, 70/30 needs to be explored further.

Landslide susceptibility mapping is an effective means to reduce landslide risk. However, previous studies have not considered spatial heterogeneity. In this study, a hybrid model considering spatial heterogeneity is designed by integrating GeoSOM and Stacking ensemble methods and is applied to map the landslide susceptibility of Zhejiang Province, China. The GeoSOM method was used to cluster the study area into several homogeneous regions to solve the heterogeneity problem, and each region was assigned a cluster attribute as one of the landslide model inputs. The Stacking ensemble technique was utilized to design a high-performance landslide model by combining three traditional machine learning methods (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT)). We collected 1051 landslide samples and fourteen affecting factors after feature selection. For landslide modelling, the landslides were randomly split into two subsets: 70% samples for training and the rest for validation. Landslide models were assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and statistical measures. The results indicated that the hybrid model was 0.11â0.135 higher than those of traditional machine learning methods in term of the area under the ROC curve (AUC). In general, this hybrid model can generate high-quality landslide susceptibility maps and help to develop policies that reduce the burden of landslides.

Due to the complex nonlinear correlations among environmental factors, traditional machine learning (ML) models have unsatisfactory LSP accuracies. In this letter, a sparse feature extraction network (SFE+) is proposed for LSP. First, the landslides and environmental factors are collected, and frequency ratios of environmental factors are calculated as the model inputs. Second, the input data are passed through the input layer with the dropout, and then, the features are passed through the hidden layers, that is, the k% lifetime sparsity layers. The hidden layers are employed to further sparse these factors to obtain the independent and redundant prediction features as much as possible. Finally, certain classifiers are used to realize the LSP in the study area. SFE-support vector machine (SVM), SFE-logistic regression (LR), and SFE-stochastic gradient descent (SGD) models are built. For comparison, principal component analysis (PCA)-SVM, PCA-LR, PCA-SGD, SVM, LR, and SGD models are also built for LSP in Shicheng County, China.

For this purpose, we created a new landslide sample library.

However, there is a great need to examine hazards holistically to better manage the complex of threats found in any region. Many regions of the world have complex hazard landscapes wherein risk from individual and/or multiple extreme events is omnipresent. Extensive parts of Iran experience a complex array of natural hazards â floods, earthquakes, landslides, forest fires, subsidence, and drought. The effectiveness of risk mitigation is in part a function of whether the complex of hazards can be collectively considered, visualized, and evaluated. This study develops and tests individual and collective multi-hazard risk maps for floods, landslides, and forest fires to visualize the spatial distribution of risk in Fars Province, southern Iran. To do this, two well-known machine-learning algorithms â SVM and MARS â are used to predict the distribution of these events. Past floods, landslides, and forest fires were surveyed and mapped. The locations of occurrence of these events (individually and collectively) were randomly separated into training (70%) and testing (30%) data sets. The conditioning factors (for floods, landslides, and forest fires) employed to model the risk distributions are aspect, elevation, drainage density, distance from faults, geology, LULC, profile curvature, annual mean rainfall, plan curvature, distance from man-made residential structures, distance from nearest river, distance from nearest road, slope gradient, soil types, mean annual temperature, and TWI. The outputs of the two models were assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, true-skill statistics (TSS), and the correlation and deviance values from each models for each hazard. The areas-under-the-curves (AUC) for the MARS model prediction were 76.0%, 91.2%, and 90.1% for floods, landslides, and forest fires, respectively. Similarly, the AUCs for the SVM model were 75.5%, 89.0%, and 91.5%. The TSS reveals that the MARS model was better able to predict landslide risk, but was less able to predict flood-risk patterns and forest-fire risk. Finally, the combination of flood, forest fire, and landslide risk maps yielded a multi-hazard susceptibility map for the province. The better predictive model indicated that 52.3% of the province was at-risk for at least one of these hazards. This multi-hazard map may yield valuable insight for land-use planning, sustainable development of infrastructure, and also integrated watershed management in Fars Province.

Thus, selecting a proper ML algorithm help us to understand possible future occurrences by analyzing the past more accurate. The main purpose of this study is to produce landslide susceptibility map of the Ayancik district of Sinop province, situated in the Black Sea region of Turkey using three featured regression tree-based ensemble methods including gradient boosting machines (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest (RF). Fifteen landslide causative factors and 105 landslide locations occurred in the region were used. The landslide inventory map was randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) dataset to construct the RF, XGBoost and GBM prediction models. Symmetrical uncertainty measure was utilized to determine the most important causative factors, and then the selected features were used to construct susceptibility prediction models. The performance of the ensemble models was validated using different accuracy metrics including Area under the curve (AUC), overall accuracy (OA), Root mean square error (RMSE), and Kappa coefficient. Also, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess differences between optimum models. The accuracy results showed that the model of XgBoost_Opt model (the model created by optimum factor combination) has the highest prediction capability (OA = 0.8501 and AUC = 0.8976), followed by the RF_opt (OA = 0.8336 and AUC = 0.8860) and GBM_Opt (OA = 0.8244 and AUC = 0.8796).

This study presents a machine learning approach based on the C5.0 decision tree (DT) model and the K-means cluster algorithm to produce a regional landslide susceptibility map. Yanchang County, a typical landslide-prone area located in northwestern China, was taken as the area of interest to introduce the proposed application procedure. A landslide inventory containing 82 landslides was prepared and subsequently randomly partitioned into two subsets: training data (70% landslide pixels) and validation data (30% landslide pixels). Fourteen landslide influencing factors were considered in the input dataset and were used to calculate the landslide occurrence probability based on the C5.0 decision tree model. Susceptibility zonation was implemented according to the cut-off values calculated by the K-means cluster algorithm. The validation results of the model performance analysis showed that the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) of the proposed model was the highest, reaching 0.88, compared with traditional models (support vector machine (SVM) = 0.85, Bayesian network (BN) = 0.81, frequency ratio (FR) = 0.75, weight of evidence (WOE) = 0.76). The landslide frequency ratio and frequency density of the high susceptibility zones were 6.76/km2 and 0.88/km2, respectively, which were much higher than those of the low susceptibility zones. The top 20% interval of landslide occurrence probability contained 89% of the historical landslides but only accounted for 10.3% of the total area. Our results indicate that the distribution of high susceptibility zones was more focused without containing more âstableâ pixels. Therefore, the obtained susceptibility map is suitable for application to landslide risk management practices.

Within classifier ensemble concept, decision tree based ensemble learners such as random forest (RF) (i.e. decision forest) and rotation forest (RotFor) have gained a great interest due to their robustness against conventional statistical methods. This study proposes canonical correlation forest (CCF), a new member of ensemble learning family, in the prediction of landslide susceptibility for Yenice district of Karabuk in Turkey. To test the robustness and suitability of the CCF method, its prediction performance was compared to two well-known machine learning ensemble algorithms, RF and RotFor, and a commonly used statistical method, the logistic regression (LR). Furthermore, the effects of variations in ratio of training/testing datasets were assessed on the performances of RF, CCF, RotFor and LR models using the root-mean square error (RMSE). The quality of resulting landslide susceptibility maps was evaluated using overall accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient (KC), success rate curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

Moreover, few papers have discussed the applicability of the ensemble learning model in landslide susceptibility mapping at the township level. This study aims at defining a robust ensemble framework that can become the benchmark method for future research dealing with the comparison of different ensemble models. For this purpose, the present work focuses on three different basic classifiers: decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron neural network model (MLPNN) and two homogeneous ensemble models such as random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The hierarchical construction of deep ensemble relied on two leading ensemble technologies (i.e., homogeneous/heterogeneous model ensemble and bagging, boosting, stacking ensemble strategy) to provide a more accurate and effective spatial probability of landslide occurrence. The selected study area is Dazhou town, located in the Jurassic red-strata area in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of China, which is a strategic economic area currently characterized by widespread landslide risk. Based on a long-term field investigation, the inventory counting thirty-three slow-moving landslide polygons was drawn. The results show that the ensemble models do not necessarily perform better; for instance, the Bagging based DT-SVM-MLPNN-XGBoost model performed worse than the single XGBoost model. Amongst the eleven tested models, the Stacking based RF-XGBoost model, which is a homogeneous model based on bagging, boosting, and stacking ensemble, showed the highest capability of predicting the landslide-affected areas. Besides, the factor behaviors of DT, SVM, MLPNN, RF and XGBoost models reflected the characteristics of slow-moving landslides in the Three Gorges reservoir area, wherein unfavorable lithological conditions and intense human engineering activities (i.e., reservoir water level fluctuation, residential area construction, and farmland development) are proven to be the key triggers.

We used these factors to produce landslide susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMT), and random forest (RF) models. To assess prediction accuracy of the models we employed the following statistical measures: negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, root-mean-squared error (RMSE), accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).

Research into landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) attempts to alleviate such catastrophes through the identification of landslide prone areas.

In this research, the potential of supervised machine learning and ensemble learning is investigated. Firstly, the Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA) supervised learning algorithm is trained for LSM and compared against other algorithms that have been widely used for the same purpose, namely Generalized Logistic Models (GLM), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT or GBM), and Random Forest (RF). Next, an ensemble model consisting of all four algorithms is implemented to examine possible performance improvements. The dataset used to train and test all the algorithms consists of a landslide inventory map of 227 landslide locations.

Experimental evaluations are made based on True Skill Statistic (TSS), the Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC) curve and kappa index. The results show that the best TSS (0.6986), ROC (0.904) and kappa (0.6915) were obtained by the ensemble model. FDA on its own seems effective at modelling landslide susceptibility from multiple data sources, with performance comparable to GLM. However, it slightly underperforms when compared to GBM (BRT) and RF. RF seems most capable compared to GBM, GLM, and FDA, when dealing with all conditioning factors.

Landslide features are generally uncorrelated or nonlinearly correlated, resulting in limited LSP performance when leveraging conventional machine learning models. In this study, a deep-learning-based model using the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and conditional random field (CRF) in cascade-parallel form was proposed for making LSPs based on remote sensing (RS) images and a geographic information system (GIS). The RS images are the main data sources of landslide-related environmental factors, and a GIS is used to analyze, store, and display spatial big data. The cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF consists of frequency ratio values of environmental factors in the input layers, cascade-parallel LSTM for feature extraction in the hidden layers, and cascade-parallel full connection for classification and CRF for landslide/non-landslide state modeling in the output layers. The cascade-parallel form of LSTM can extract features from different layers and merge them into concrete features. The CRF is used to calculate the energy relationship between two grid points, and the extracted features are further smoothed and optimized. As a case study, the cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF was applied to Shicheng County of Jiangxi Province in China. A total of 2709 landslide grid cells were recorded and 2709 non-landslide grid cells were randomly selected from the study area. The results show that, compared with existing main traditional machine learning algorithms, such as multilayer perception, logistic regression, and decision tree, the proposed cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF had a higher landslide prediction rate (positive predictive rate: 72.44%, negative predictive rate: 80%, total predictive rate: 75.67%). In conclusion, the proposed cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF is a novel data-driven deep learning model that overcomes the limitations of traditional machine learning algorithms and achieves promising results for making LSPs.

Landslide susceptibility maps, which help to identify which regions in a given area are at greater risk of a landslide occurring, are a key tool for effective mitigation. Research in this field has grown immensely, ranging from quantitative to deterministic approaches, with a recent surge in machine learning (ML)-based computational models. The development of ML models, in particular, has undergone a meteoritic rise in the last decade, contributing to the successful development of accurate susceptibility maps. However, despite their success, these models are rarely used by stakeholders owing to their “black box” nature. Hence, it is crucial to explain the results, thus providing greater transparency for the use of such models. To address this gap, the present work introduces the use of an ML-based explainable algorithm, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), for landslide susceptibility modeling. A convolutional neural network model was used conducted in the CheongJu region in South Korea. A total of 519 landslide locations were examined with 16 landslide-affected variables, of which 70% was used for training and 30% for testing, and the model achieved an accuracy of 89%. Further, the comparison was performed using Support Vector Machine mode, which achieved an accuracy of 84%. The SHAP plots showed variations in feature interactions for both landslide and non-landslide locations, thus providing more clarity as to how the model achieves a specific result. The SHAP dependence plots explained the relationship between altitude and slope, showing a negative relationship with altitude and a positive relationship with slope. This is the first use of an explainable ML model in landslide susceptibility modeling, and we argue that future works should include aspects of explainability to open up the possibility of developing a transferable artificial intelligence model. © 2023 The Authors",Applied Soft Computing,10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110324,13,13,Yes,"SHAP,CNN",,"Australia,Malaysia,South Korea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To construct efficient susceptibility prediction considering different landslide types, Huichang County in China is taken as example. Firstly, 105 rock falls, 350 colluvial landslides and 11 related environmental factors are identified. Then four machine learning models, namely logistic regression, multi-layer perception, support vector machine and C5.0 decision tree are applied for susceptibility modeling of rock fall and colluvial landslide. Thirdly, three different landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) models considering landslide types based on C5.0 decision tree with excellent performance are constructed to generate final landslide susceptibility: (i) united method, which combines all landslide types directly; (ii) probability statistical method, which couples analyses of susceptibility indices under different landslide types based on probability formula; and (iii) maximum comparison method, which selects the maximum susceptibility index through comparing the predicted susceptibility indices under different types of landslides. Finally, uncertainties of landslide susceptibility are assessed by prediction accuracy, mean value and standard deviation. It is concluded that LSP results of the three coupled models considering landslide types basically conform to the spatial occurrence patterns of landslides in Huichang County. The united method has the best susceptibility prediction performance, followed by the probability method and maximum susceptibility method. More cases are needed to verify this result in-depth.

However, there are still challenges remain in landslide mapping due to the availability of limited inventory data. In this paper, a novel method that improves the performance of machine learning techniques is presented. The proposed method creates synthetic inventory data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for improving the prediction of landslides. In this research, landslide inventory data of 156 landslide locations were identified in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia, taken from previous projects the authors worked on. Elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, total curvature, lithology, land use and land cover (LULC), distance to the road, distance to the river, stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), terrain roughness index (TRI), topographic wetness index (TWI) and vegetation density are geo-environmental factors considered in this study based on suggestions from previous works on Cameron Highlands. To show the capability of GANs in improving landslide prediction models, this study tests the proposed GAN model with benchmark models namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Bagging ensemble models with ANN and SVM models. These models were validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The DT, RF, SVM, ANN and Bagging ensemble could achieve the AUROC values of (0.90, 0.94, 0.86, 0.69 and 0.82) for the training; and the AUROC of (0.76, 0.81, 0.85, 0.72 and 0.75) for the test, subsequently.

Using the additional samples improved the test accuracy of all the models except SVM.

Different expressions of landslide boundaries and spatial shapes may lead to substantial differences in the distribution of predicted landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs); moreover, the presence of irregular landslide boundaries and spatial shapes introduces uncertainties into the LSM. To address this issue by accurately drawing polygonal boundaries based on LSM, the uncertainty patterns of LSM modelling under two different landslide boundaries and spatial shapes, such as landslide points and circles, are compared. Within the research area of Ruijin City in China, a total of 370 landslides with accurate boundary information are obtained, and 10 environmental factors, such as slope and lithology, are selected. Then, correlation analyses between the landslide boundary shapes and selected environmental factors are performed via the frequency ratio (FR) method. Next, a support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) based on landslide points, circles and accurate landslide polygons are constructed as point-, circle- and polygon-based SVM and RF models, respectively, to address LSM. Finally, the prediction capabilities of the above models are compared by computing their statistical accuracy using receiver operating characteristic analysis, and the uncertainties of the predicted LSIs under the above models are discussed. The results show that using polygonal surfaces with a higher reliability and accuracy to express the landslide boundary and spatial shape can provide a markedly improved LSM accuracy, compared to those based on the points and circles. Moreover, a higher degree of uncertainty of LSM modelling is present in the expression of points because there are too few grid units acting as model input variables. Additionally, the expression of the landslide boundary as circles introduces errors in measurement and is not as accurate as the polygonal boundary in most LSM modelling cases. In addition, the results under different conditions show that the polygon-based models have a higher LSM accuracy, with lower mean values and larger standard deviations compared with the point- and circle-based models. Finally, the overall LSM accuracy of the RF is superior to that of the SVM, and similar patterns of landslide boundary and spatial shape affecting the LSM modelling are reflected in the SVM and RF models.

While current methods are chiefly applied to generate event-inventories, whereas multi-temporal (MT) inventories are rare, even using manual landslide mapping. Here, we present an innovative deep learning strategy which employs transfer learning that allows for the Attention Deep Supervision Multi-Scale U-Net model to be adapted for landslide detection tasks in new areas. The method also provides the flexibility of re-training a pretrained model to detect both rainfall- and earthquake-triggered landslides on new target areas. For the mapping, we used archived Planet Lab remote sensing images spanning a period between 2009 till 2021 with spatial resolution of 3–5 m to systematically generate MT landslide inventories. When we examined all cases, our approach provided an average F1 score of 0.8 indicating that we successfully identified the spatiotemporal occurrences of landslides. To examine the size distribution of mapped landslides we compared the frequency-area distributions of predicted co-seismic landslides with manually mapped products from the literature. Results showed a good match between calculated power-law exponents where the difference ranges between 0.04 and 0.21. Overall, this study showed that the proposed algorithm could be applied to large areas to generate polygon-based MT landslide inventories. © 2023, The Author(s).",Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-022-27352-y,12,12,No,,,"Italy,Netherlands",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EQIL inventories are generated mostly by the traditional or semisupervised mapping approaches, which required a parameter's tuning or binary threshold decision in the practical application. In this study, we investigated the impact of optical data from the PlanetScope sensor and topographic factors from the ALOS sensor on EQIL mapping using a deep-learning convolution neural network (CNN). Thus, six training datasets were prepared and used to evaluate the performance of the CNN model using only optical data and using these data along with each and all topographic factors across the west coast of the Trishuli river in Nepal. For the first time, the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) model was applied for combining the resulting maps from each CNN stream that trained with different datasets. Finally, seven different resulting maps were compared against a detailed and accurate inventory of landslide polygons by a mean intersection-over-union (mIOU). Our results confirm that using the training dataset of the spectral information along with the topographic factor of the slope is helpful to distinguish the landslide bodies from other similar features, such as barren lands, and consequently increases the mapping accuracy. The improvement of the mIOU was a range from approximately zero to more than 17%.

The former are optimized to produce interpretable results, whereas the latter seeks to maximize the predictive performance of the task at hand. This is valid for any scientific field and for any method belonging to the two categories mentioned above. When attempting to predict natural hazards, this difference has lead researchers to make drastic decisions on which aspect to prioritize, a difficult choice to make. In fact, one would always seek the highest performance because at higher performances correspond better decisions for disaster risk reduction. However, scientists also wish to understand the results, as a way to rely on the tool they developed. Today, very recent development in deep learning have brought forward a new generation of interpretable artificial intelligence, where the prediction power typical of machine learning tools is equipped with a level of explanatory power typical of statistical approaches. In this work, we attempt to demonstrate the capabilities of this new generation of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). To do so, we take the landslide susceptibility context as reference.

Most past studies involved cell-based analysis that takes landslide incidents as geo-spatial points. Nevertheless, given that a landslide is a two-dimensional polygon on maps and a three-dimensional object in the real world, an object-wise assessment is more logical. Fusing with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, this paper proposes a novel AI-powered object-based landslide susceptibility assessment method to address this issue. First, landslide and non-landslide objects are defined based on an optimal object size determined by statistics of historical landslides. Next, landslide and non-landslide samples are constructed by integrating geoenvironmental data layers derived from multi-source data. Subsequently, AI techniques are applied to learn susceptibility prediction based on the prepared samples. To illustrate the proposed method, a comprehensive case study of Hong Kong is conducted, in which six AI algorithms are evaluated including logistic regression (area under curve, AUC = 0.949), random forest (AUC = 0.951), LogitBoost (AUC = 0.958), convolutional neural network (CNN) (AUC = 0.966), bidirectional long short-term memory architecture of recurrent neural network (BiLSTM-RNN) (AUC = 0.966), and CNN-LSTM (AUC = 0.972), among which the BiLSTM-RNN and CNN-LSTM algorithms are applied in landslide susceptibility assessment for the first time. Results confirm that the proposed object-based method outperforms the traditional cell-based method significantly. Equally importantly, the case study produced the first set of AI-based territory-wide landslide susceptibility maps for Hong Kong. These maps can be used as a fundamental tool for quantifying natural terrain landslide risk and identifying susceptible zones where landslide mitigation measures may be needed.

The number of landslides and the level of damage across the globe has been increasing over time. Therefore, landslide management is essential to maintain the natural and socio-economic dynamics of the hilly region. Rorachu river basin is one of the most landslide-prone areas of the Sikkim selected for the present study. The prime goal of the study is to prepare landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) using computer-based advanced machine learning techniques and compare the performance of the models. To properly understand the existing spatial relation with the landslide, twenty factors, including triggering and causative factors, were selected. A deep learning algorithm viz. convolutional neural network model (CNN) and three popular machine learning techniques, i.e., random forest model (RF), artificial neural network model (ANN), and bagging model, were employed to prepare the LSMs. Two separate datasets including training and validation were designed by randomly taken landslide and non-landslide points. A ratio of 70:30 was considered for the selection of both training and validation points. Multicollinearity was assessed by tolerance and variance inflation factor, and the role of individual conditioning factors was estimated using information gain ratio. The result reveals that there is no severe multicollinearity among the landslide conditioning factors, and the triggering factor rainfall appeared as the leading cause of the landslide. Based on the final prediction values of each model, LSM was constructed and successfully portioned into five distinct classes, like very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The susceptibility class-wise distribution of landslides shows that more than 90% of the landslide area falls under higher landslide susceptibility grades. The precision of models was examined using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and statistical methods like root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). In both datasets (training and validation), the CNN model achieved the maximum AUC value of 0.903 and 0.939, respectively. The lowest value of RMSE and MAE also reveals the better performance of the CNN model. So, it can be concluded that all the models have performed well, but the CNN model has outperformed the other models in terms of precision.

Assessing the hazard they pose and what drives their movement in the years following the mainshock has not yet been attempted, primarily because multitemporal landslide inventories are lacking. By exploiting a multitemporal inventory (2005-2018) covering the epicentral region of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and a set of conditioning factors (seismic, topographic, and hydrological), we perform statistical tests to understand the temporal evolution of these factors affecting debris remobilizations. Our analyses, supported by a random-forest susceptibility assessment model, reveal a prediction capability of seismic-related variables declining with time, as opposed to hydro-topographic parameters gaining importance and becoming predominant within a decade. These results may have important implications on the way conventional susceptibility/hazard assessment models should be employed in areas where coseismic landslides are the main sediment production mechanism on slopes. Plain Language Summary Strong earthquakes in mountain regions can trigger thousands of landslides, forming deposits of rock and soil debris along steep slopes. Months to years later, rainstorms may generate debris flows-destructive water-debris mixtures that rush downslope and flood valleys. Scientists use models to estimate the hazard of landslides and debris flows, which are based on accurate maps of the slopes, the type of rock or soil, inventories of known landslides, rainfall trends, and more. Susceptibility and hazard maps are the main product of these models. They are used to predict the probability of a hazardous event occurring at a given location in a given time span. These maps are usually ""static,"" in the sense that they are thought to remain valid for a long time because the data they are based upon (such as the shape of slopes) do not vary much. However, postearthquake landscapes are very dynamic: debris moves downslope, carried by rain or shaken by aftershocks; meanwhile, new landslides occur on some slopes, while others revegetate and stabilize. The overall picture is complex as many variables are involved.

Landslides are one of the main sources of risk to the safe operations of oil and gas pipelines in mountainous areas. This work aims to propose a quantitative assessment model of landslide-induced long-distance pipeline risk by analyzing historical landslide hazard data along oil and gas pipelines. Using the Changshou-Fuling-Wulong-Nanchuan (CN) gas pipeline dataset, two independent assessments were carried out: landslide susceptibility assessment and pipeline vulnerability assessment. Firstly, the study combined the recursive feature elimination and particle swarm optimization-AdaBoost method (RFE-PSO-AdaBoost) to develop a landslide susceptibility mapping model. The RFE method was used to select the conditioning factors, while PSO was used to tune the hyper-parameters. Secondly, considering the angular relationship between the pipelines and landslides, and the segmentation of the pipelines using the fuzzy clustering (FC), the CRITIC method (FC-CRITIC) was combined to develop a pipeline vulnerability assessment model. Accordingly, a pipeline risk map was obtained based on pipeline vulnerability and landslide susceptibility assessment. The study results show that almost 35.3% of the slope units were in extremely high susceptibility zones, 6.68% of the pipelines were in extremely high vulnerability areas, the southern and eastern pipelines segmented in the study area were located in high risk areas and coincided well with the distribution of landslides. The proposed hybrid machine learning model for landslide-oriented risk assessment of long-distance pipelines can provide a scientific and reasonable risk classification for new planning or in service pipelines to avoid landslide-oriented risk and ensure their safe operation in mountainous areas. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Journal of Environmental Management,10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118177,10,10,No,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the characteristics and effectiveness of convolutional neural network (CNN) and conventional machine learning (ML) methods in a landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) are compared. Six ML methods used in this study are Adaboost, multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN), random forest (RF), naive Bayes, decision tree (DT), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). First, the basic knowledge and structures of the CNN and ML methods, and the steps of the LSA are introduced. Then, 11 conditioning factors in three categories in the Hongxi River Basin, Pingwu County, Mianyang City, Sichuan Province are chosen to build the train, validation, and test samples. The CNN and ML models are constructed based on these samples. For comparison, indicator methods, statistical methods, and landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) are used. The result shows that the CNN can obtain the highest accuracy (86.41%) and the highest AUC (0.9249) in the LSA. The statistical methods represented by the mean and variance of TP and TN perform more firmly on the possibility of landslide occurrence. Furthermore, the LSMs show that all models can successfully identify most of the landslide points, but for areas with a low frequency of landslides, some models are insufficient. The CNN model demonstrates better results in the recognition of the landslides’ cluster region, this is also related to the convolution operation that takes the surrounding environment information into account. The higher accuracy and more concentrative possibility of CNN in LSA is of great significance for disaster prevention and mitigation, which can help the efficient use of human and material resources. Although CNN performs better than other methods, there are still some limitations, the identification of low-cluster landside areas can be enhanced by improving the CNN model. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15030798,10,10,Yes,"CNN,MLPNN,AB,RF,NB,DT,GBDT",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques).

Experiments were conducted in the Kurseong region, a part of Darjeeling Himalaya as a study area. Previous landslide sites were identified through field survey and previous records. Total 273 landslide sites were compiled and considered for the landslide inventory map to calibrate as well as validate the models. Seventeen landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were used for landslide susceptibility modelling, i.e. slope degree, elevation, aspect, curvature, rainfall, geological structure, lineament, distance to main roads, soil texture, soil depth, earthquake zone, land-use/land-cover, drainage density, stream power index, sediment transport index, and topographic wetness index. The generated landslide susceptibility maps were validated applying the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Proportion Correctly Classified (PCC) and the seed cell area index (SCAI). The results revealed that prediction rates are 89.47%, 91.81%, and 94.45% with standard error 0.0359, 0.0289 and 0.0183 respectively for WoE, SVM and ensemble WoE-SVM models. The study shows that the fellow land, plantation area, roads side areas and denudation structural hills having elevation more than 1500 m and 24Â° to 69Â° slopes are extremely susceptible to landslides. The comparison of the produced landslide maps revealed that all the applicable models have committed accuracy for studying sensitivity in Kurseong region of Darjeeling Himalaya. The ensemble model has better capability than the other two models.

Uncertainties in the results of various landslide susceptibility models create challenges in selecting the most suitable method to manage this complex natural phenomenon. This study aimed to propose an approach to reduce uncertainties in landslide prediction, diagnosing spatial agreement in machine learning-based landslide susceptibility maps. It first developed landslide susceptibility maps of Coxâs Bazar district of Bangladesh, applying four machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), featuring hyperparameter optimization of 12 landslide conditioning factors. The results of all the four models yielded very high prediction accuracy, with the area under the curve (AUC) values range between 0.93 to 0.96. The assessment of spatial agreement of landslide predictions showed that the pixel-wise correlation coefficients of landslide probability between various models range from 0.69 to 0.85, indicating the uncertainty in predicted landslides by various models, despite their considerable prediction accuracy. The uncertainty was addressed by establishing a Logistic Regression (LR) model, incorporating the binary landslide inventory data as the dependent variable and the results of the four landslide susceptibility models as independent variables. The outcomes indicated that the RF model had the highest influence in predicting the observed landslide locations, followed by the MLP, SVM, and KNN models. Finally, a combined landslide susceptibility map was developed by integrating the results of the four machine learning-based landslide predictions. The combined map resulted in better spatial agreement (correlation coefficients range between 0.88 and 0.92) and greater prediction accuracy (0.97) compared to the individual models. The modelling approach followed in this study would be useful in minimizing uncertainties of various methods and improving landslide predictions. Â© 2020 by the authors.

High-performance-based hazard prediction models, therefore, are urgently required to prevent related hazards and manage potential emergencies. Current researches mainly focus on susceptibility of single hazard but ignore that different types of geological hazards might occur simultaneously under a complex environment. Here, we firstly built a multi-geohazard inventory from 2000 to 2015 based on a geographical information system and used satellite data in Google earth and then chose twelve conditioning factors and three machine learning methodsârandom forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)âto generate rock fall, landslide, and debris flow susceptibility maps. The results show that debris flow models presented the best prediction capabilities [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC 0.95)], followed by rock fall (AUC 0.94) and landslide (AUC 0.85). Additionally, XGBoost outperformed the other two methods with the highest AUC of 0.93. All three methods with AUC values larger than 0.84 suggest that these models have fairly good performance to assess geological hazards susceptibility. Finally, evolution index was constructed based on a joint probability of these three hazard models to predict the evolution tendency of 35 unstable slopes in Jiuzhaigou. The results show that these unstable slopes are likely to evolve into debris flows with a probability of 46%, followed by landslides (43%) and rock falls (29%). Higher susceptibility areas for geohazards were mainly located in the southeast and middle of Jiuzhaigou, implying geohazards prevention and mitigation measures should be taken there in near future.

A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments.

Reducing the outputs obtained after each modelling analysis is key to present the results for stakeholders, land managers and policymakers. So, the main goal of this survey was to present a method to synthesize three natural hazards in one multi-hazard map and its evaluation for hazard management and land use planning. To test this methodology, we took as study area the Gorganrood Watershed, located in the Golestan Province (Iran). First, an inventory map of three different types of hazards including flood, landslides, and gullies was prepared using field surveys and different official reports. To generate the susceptibility maps, a total of 17 geo-environmental factors were selected as predictors using the MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) machine learning technique. The accuracy of the predictive models was evaluated by drawing receiver operating characteristic-ROC curves and calculating the area under the ROC curve-AUCROC. The MaxEnt model not only implemented superbly in the degree of fitting, but also obtained significant results in predictive performance. Variables importance of the three studied types of hazards showed that river density, distance from streams, and elevation were the most important factors for flood, respectively. Lithological units, elevation, and annual mean rainfall were relevant for detecting landslides. On the other hand, annual mean rainfall, elevation, and lithological units were used for gully erosion mapping in this study area. Finally, by combining the flood, landslides, and gully erosion susceptibility maps, an integrated multi-hazard map was created. The results demonstrated that 60% of the area is subjected to hazards, reaching a proportion of landslides up to 21.2% in the whole territory. We conclude that using this type of multi-hazard map may be a useful tool for local administrators to identify areas susceptible to hazards at large scales as we demonstrated in this research.

Existing data-driven susceptibility mapping models are not globally applicable due to the high variability of landslide conditioning parameters and the limitations in the availability of up-to-date and accurate data. Among numerous applications, landslide susceptibility maps are essential for site selection and health monitoring of engineering structures, such as dams, for increasing their lifetime and to prevent from disastrous events caused by the damages. In this study, landslide susceptibility mapping performance of XGBoost algorithm was evaluated in a landslide-prone area in the upper basin of Ataturk Dam, which is a prime investment located in the southeast of Turkey. The study area has a size of 2718.7 km2 with an elevation difference of ca. 2000 m and contains 27 lithological units. EU-DEM v1.1 from the Copernicus Programme was used to derive the geomorphological features. High classification accuracy with area under curve value of 0.96 could be obtained from the XGBoost algorithm. According to the results, the main factors controlling the landslides in the study area are the lithology, altitude and topographic wetness index. Â© 2021 by the authors.

In contrast, intuitive annotation of landslides from satellite imagery is based on distinct features rather than individual pixels. This study examines the feasibility of the integration framework of a DL model with rule-based object-based image analysis (OBIA) to detect landslides. First, we designed a ResU-Net model and then trained and tested it in the Sentinel-2 imagery. Then we developed a simple rule-based OBIA with only four rulesets, applying it first to the original image dataset and then to the same dataset plus the resulting ResU-Net heatmap. The value of each pixel in the heatmap refers to the probability that the pixel belongs to either landslide or non-landslide classes. Thus, we evaluate three scenarios: ResU-Net, OBIA, and ResU-Net-OBIA. The landslide detection maps from three different classification scenarios were compared against a manual landslide inventory map using thematic accuracy assessment metrics: precision, recall, and f1-score. Our experiments in the testing area showed that the proposed integration framework yields f1-score values 8 and 22 percentage points higher than those of the ResU-Net and OBIA approaches, respectively.

However, they have not been studied for all-natural materials, as well as different locations. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel generalized artificial intelligence model for estimating the friction angle of clays from different areas/locations for evaluating slope stability or landslide susceptibility mapping, including the datasets from the UK, New Zealand, Indonesia, Venezuela, USA, Japan, and Italy. The robustness and consistency of the modelâs prediction were checked by testing with various datasets having different geological and geomorphological setups. Accordingly, 162 observations from different areas/locations were collected from the locations and regions above for this aim. Subsequently, deep learning techniques were applied to develop the multiple layer perceptron (MLP) neural network model (i.e., DMLP model) with the goal of error reduction of the MLP model. Next, Harris Hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm was applied to boost the optimization of the DMLP model for predicting friction angle of clays aiming to get a better accuracy than those of the DMLP model, called HHOâDMLP model. A DMLP neural network without optimization of the HHO algorithm and two other conventional models (i.e., SVM and RF) were also employed to compare with the proposed HHOâDMLP model. The results showed that the proposed HHOâDMLP model predicted the friction angle of clays better than those of the other models. It can reflect the friction angle of clays with acceptable accuracy from different locations and regions (i.e., MSE = 12.042; RMSE = 3.470; R2 = 0.796; MAPE = 0.182; and VAF = 78.806). The DMLP model without optimization of the HHO algorithm provided slightly lower accuracy (i.e., MSE = 15.151; RMSE = 3.892; R2 = 0.738; MAPE = 0.202; and VAF = 73.431). Besides, two other conventional models (i.e., SVM and RF) provided low reliability, especially over-fitting happened with the RF model, and it was not recommended to be used to predict the friction angle of clays (i.e., RMSE = 6.325 and R2 = 0.377 on the training dataset, but RMSE = 1.669 and R2 = 0.961 on the testing dataset).

Each year it causes fatalities, casualties and economic and social losses on large populated areas. Accurate short-term predictions of landslides can be extremely important and useful, in order to both provide local authorities with efficient prediction/early warning and increase the resilience to manage emergencies. There is an extensive literature addressing the problem of computing landslide susceptibility maps (which is a classification problem exploiting a large range of static features) and only few on actual short terms predictions (spatial and temporal). The short-term prediction models are still empirical and obtain unsatisfactory results, also in the identification of the predictors. The new aspects addressed in this paper are: (i) a short-term prediction model (1 day in advance) of landslide based on machine learning, (ii) real time features as good predictors. The introduction of explainable artificial intelligence techniques allowed to understand global and local feature relevance. In order to find the best prediction model, some machine learning solutions have been implemented and assessed. The obtained models overcome the ones available in literature. The validation has been performed in the context of the Metropolitan City of Florence, data from 2013 to 2019. The method based on XGBoost achieved best results, demonstrating that it is the most reliable and robust against false alarms. Finally, we applied explainable artificial intelligence techniques locally and globally to derive a deep understanding of the predictive model's outputs and features' relevance, and relationships. The analysis allowed us to identify the best feature for short term predictions and their impact in local cases and global prediction model.

Due to the extremely hazardous geological environment around the highway, landslides, debris flows, collapses, and subsidence are frequent. Among them, debris flows are one of the most serious geological hazards on the Karakoram Highway, and they often cause interruptions to traffic and casualties. Therefore, the development of debris flow susceptibility mapping along the highway can potentially facilitate its safe operation. In this study, we used remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning techniques to map debris flow susceptibility along the Karakoram Highway in areas where observation data are scarce and difficult to obtain by field survey. First, the distribution of 544 catchments which are prone to debris flow were identified through visual interpretation of remote sensing images. The factors influencing debris flow susceptibility were then analyzed, and a total of 17 parameters related to geomorphology, soil materials, and triggering conditions were selected. Model training was based on multiple common machine learning methods, including Ensemble Methods, Gaussian Processes, Generalized Linear models, Navies Bayes, Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Trees, Discriminant Analysis, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Support Vector Classification (SVC) was chosen as the final model after evaluation; its accuracy (ACC) was 0.91, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.96. Among the factors involved in SVC, the Melton Ratio (MR) was the most important, followed by drainage density (DD), Hypsometric Integral (HI), and average slope (AS), indicating that geomorphic conditions play an important role in predicting debris flow susceptibility in the study area. SVC was used to map debris flow susceptibility in the study area, and the results will potentially facilitate the safe operation of the highway. © 2020 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs12182933,35,9,Yes,"GLM,NB,SVM,XGB",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, by using aerial photos and geological field surveys, the 263 landslide locations in the study area were obtained. Next, the identified landslides were randomly classified according to the ratio of 70/30 to construct training data and validation models, respectively. Secondly, based on the landslide inventory map, combined with the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the study area, 14 affecting factors of the landslide were determined. The predictive ability of the selected factors was evaluated using the LSVM model. Using the WoE model, the relationship between landslides and affecting factors was analyzed by positive and negative correlation methods. The above three hybrid models were then used to map landslide susceptibility. Thirdly, the ROC curve and various statistical data (SE, 95% CI and MAE) were used to verify and compare the predictive power of the model. Compared with the other two models, the Sysfor model had a larger area under the curve (AUC) of 0.876 (training dataset) and 0.783 (validation dataset). Finally, by quantitatively comparing the susceptibility values of each pixel, the differences in spatial morphology of landslide susceptibility maps were compared, and the model was found to have limitations and effectiveness. The landslide susceptibility maps obtained by the three models are reasonable, and the landslide susceptibility maps generated by the SysFor model have the highest comprehensive performance.

We used these factors to produce landslide susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMT), and random forest (RF) models. To assess prediction accuracy of the models we employed the following statistical measures: negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, root-mean-squared error (RMSE), accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).

Thirdly, four types of machine-learning predictors with 30 m and 60 m grid resolutionsâC5.0 decision tree (C5.0 DT), logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM)âare applied to construct the landslide susceptibility prediction models considering the SE factor as SE-C5.0 DT, SE-LR, SE-MLP and SE-SVM models; C5.0 DT, LR, MLP and SVM models with no SE are also used for comparisons. Finally, the area under receiver operating feature curve is used to verify the prediction accuracy of these models, and the relative importance of all the 10 predisposing factors is ranked. The results indicate that: (1) SE factor plays the most important role in landslide susceptibility prediction among all 10 predisposing factors under both 30 m and 60 m resolutions; (2) the SE-based models have more accurate landslide susceptibility prediction than the single models with no SE factor; (3) all the models with 30 m resolutions have higher landslide susceptibility prediction accuracy than those with 60 m resolutions; and (4) the C5.0 DT and SVM models show higher landslide susceptibility prediction performance than the MLP and LR models.

At the outset, for the sample of 1522 investigated landslides and 1522 non-landslides, twenty-two factors were chosen as the initial landslide-conditioning factors to construct a spatial database. Subsequently, the GeoDetector and RFE-RF methods were adopted to eliminate the least effective factors, respectively, with the Geo-RFE-RF model being formulated with the combination factors of these two methods. Finally, the performance of the Geo-RFE-RF and RF model with twenty-two initial factors (In-RF) were compared and assessed, and the higher accuracy model was employed to generate a LSM in a case study area, Fengjie County (China). The results indicate that, the Area Under Curve, Accuracy, Precision, and F1 Score of the test dataset is increased by 0.9%, 0.4%, 1.5%, and 0.3%, respectively, under the Geo-RFE-RF model, as compared to the In-RF model. The conditioning factors used to construct the model have been reduced from twenty-two to thirteen, but the predictive ability of the Geo-RFE-RF model performs better, proving the effectiveness of the hybrid model that combines the factors from GeoDetector and RFE-RF methods. This hybrid model not only considers the spatial pattern characteristics of spatial data for screening factors, but the selected factors are also in good agreement with the adopted machine learning method, offering potential use as a general framework for eliminating redundant and noise factors in LSM across the globe.

Consequently, landslide risk assessment has become requisite for managing the resources in future. This study was designed to develop four ensemble metaheuristic machine learning algorithms, such as grey wolf optimized based artificial neural network (GW-ANN), grey wolf optimized based random forest (GW-RF), particle swarm optimization optimized based ANN (PSO-ANN), and PSO optimized based RF for modeling rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility (LS) in Aqabat Al-Sulbat, Asir region, Saudi Arabia, which observes landslide frequently. To obtain very high precision and robust prediction from machine learning algorithms, the grey wolf and PSO optimization algorithms were integrated to develop new ensemble machine learning techniques. Subsequently, LS maps produced by training dataset were validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve based on the testing dataset. Based on the area under curve (AUC) value of ROC curve, the best method for LS modeling was selected. We developed ROC curve-based sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of the parameters for LS modeling. The Gumble extreme value distribution was employed to estimate the rainfall at 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 year return periods. Then, the landslide hazard maps were prepared at different return periods by integrating the best LS model and estimated rainfall at different return periods. The theory of danger pixels was employed to prepare a final risk assessment of the resources, which have been exposed to the landslide. The results showed that 27â42 and 6â15 km2 were predicted as the very high and high LS zones using four ensemble metaheuristic machine learning algorithms. Based on the area under curve (AUC) of ROC, GR-ANN (AUC-0.905) appeared as the best model for LS modeling. The areas under high and very high landslide hazard were gradually increased over the progression of time (26 km2 at the 2 year return period and 40 km2 at the 100 year return period for the high landslide hazard zone, and 6 km2 at the 2 year return period and 20 km2 at the 100 year return period for the very high landslide hazard zone). Similarly, the areas of danger pixel also increased gradually from the 2 to 100 year return periods (37 km2 to 62 km2 ). Various natural resources, such as scrubland, built up, and sparse vegetation, were identified under risk zone due to landslide hazards. In addition, these resources would be exposed extensively to landslides over the advancement of return periods. Therefore, the outcome of the present study will help planners and scientists to propose high precision management plans for protecting natural resources, which have been exposed to landslides.

However, it is difficult to determine appropriate machine learning models for mapping landslide susceptibility. Additionally, it is significant to consider the influences of early effective rainfall on landslide instability in the critical rainfall threshold methods. Furthermore, the uncertainties of the critical rainfall threshold values generated by different calculation methods have not been well explored. To overcome these three drawbacks, first, frequency ratio analysis-based logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models are adopted to predict landslide susceptibility for machine learning model comparison. Second, three different types of critical rainfall threshold methods, namely, cumulative effective rainfall-duration (EE-D), effective rainfall intensity-duration (EI-D) and cumulative effective rainfall-effective rainfall intensity (EE-EI) models, are proposed to calculate the temporal probabilities of landslide occurrence under rainfall conditions based on the concept of effective rainfall. The accuracies and uncertainties of these three critical rainfall threshold methods are discussed. Finally, the landslide susceptibility maps and the critical rainfall threshold values are coupled to predict the rainfall-induced landslide hazards. Xunwu County in China is selected as the study area, and several rainfall-induced landslides are used as the test samples of the proposed landslide hazard warning model. The results show that the RF model has remarkably higher susceptibility prediction accuracy than the SVM and LR models, and the prediction performance of the temporal probabilities of landslide occurrence using the EI-D values are higher than those of EE-D and EE-EI values. Furthermore, rainfall-induced landslide hazard warning is effectively implemented based on the coupling of the susceptibility map and EI-D model.

Due to the complex nonlinear correlations among environmental factors, traditional machine learning (ML) models have unsatisfactory LSP accuracies. In this letter, a sparse feature extraction network (SFE+) is proposed for LSP. First, the landslides and environmental factors are collected, and frequency ratios of environmental factors are calculated as the model inputs. Second, the input data are passed through the input layer with the dropout, and then, the features are passed through the hidden layers, that is, the k% lifetime sparsity layers. The hidden layers are employed to further sparse these factors to obtain the independent and redundant prediction features as much as possible. Finally, certain classifiers are used to realize the LSP in the study area. SFE-support vector machine (SVM), SFE-logistic regression (LR), and SFE-stochastic gradient descent (SGD) models are built. For comparison, principal component analysis (PCA)-SVM, PCA-LR, PCA-SGD, SVM, LR, and SGD models are also built for LSP in Shicheng County, China.

This paper explores the predictive capacity of different approaches to LS modelling using artificial intelligence. The key objective of this study is to estimate a LS map for the Taleghan-Alamut basin of Iran using Credal Decision Tree (CDT)-based (i.e. CDT-Bagging, CDT-Multiboost and CDT-SubSpace) hybrid machine learning approaches, which are state-of-the-art soft computing approaches that are hardly ever utilized in the assessment of LS. In this study, we used eighteen landslide predisposing factors (LPFs) that we considered to be the most important local morphological and geo-environmental factors influencing the occurrence of landslides. We calculated the significance of each of the LPFs in the landslide susceptibility assessment using the Random Forest Method. We also employed the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, precision, performance, map robustness measurement and selection of the best-fitting models. The results shows that, compared to the other models, the CDT-Multiboost is the excellent model in this perspective with an average area under curve (AUC) of 0.993 based on a 4-fold cross-validation. We, therefore, consider the CDT-Multiboost models to be an effective method for improving spatial prediction of LS where landslide scarps or bodies are not clearly identified during the preparation of landslide inventory maps. Therefore, it will be helpful for preparing future landslide inventory maps and mitigate landslide damages.

We used a fourfold cross-validation (CV) to select the training and testing data to remove any random results of the model. Topographic slope data was used as auxiliary information to increase the performance of the model. The resulting landslide inventory map, created using the slope data with the spectral information, reduces the false positives, which helps to distinguish the landslide areas from other similar features such as barren lands and riverbeds. However, while including the slope data did not increase the true positives, the overall accuracy was higher compared to using only spectral information to train the model. The mean accuracies of correctly classified landslide values were 65.5% when using only optical data, which increased to 78% with the use of slope data.

The present work had the aim of mapping and monitoring the forest change from 2000 to 2019 and of simulating the future forest development of a rainforest region located in the ParÃ¡ state, Brazil. The land cover dynamics were mapped at five-year intervals based on a supervised classification model deployed on the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine. Besides the benefits of reduced computational time, the service is coupled with a vast data catalogue providing useful access to global products, such as multispectral images of the missions Landsat five, seven, eight and Sentinel-2. The validation procedures were done through photointerpretation of highresolution panchromatic images obtained from CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite).

Till now, visual interpretation and field survey are still the most widely adopted techniques for landslide mapping, which are often criticized labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, deep-learning-based approach for landslide detection and mapping has drawn great attention for its significant advantages over the traditional techniques. However, lack of sufficient training samples has constrained the application of deep-learning-based approach in landslide detection from satellite images for a long time. The present study aimed to examine the feasibility of a new deep-learning-based approach to intelligently detect and map earthquake-triggered landslides from singleoral RapidEye satellite images. Specifically, the proposed approach consists of three steps. First of all, a standard data preprocessing workflow to automatically generate training samples was designed and some data augmentation strategies were implemented to alleviate the lack of training samples. Then, a cascaded end-to-end deep learning network, namely LandsNet, was constructed to learn various features of landslides. Finally, the identified landslide maps were further optimized with morphological processing. Experiments in two spatially independent earthquake-affected regions showed our proposed approach yielded the best F1 value of about 86.89%, which was about 7% and 8% higher than that obtained by ResUNet and DeepUNet, respectively. Comparative studies on the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach with ResUNet and DeepUNet demonstrated its strong application potentials in the emergency response of natural disasters.

(2) Methods: This paper selects three counties (Chengkou, Wushan and Wuxi counties) in northeastern Chongqing, delineated as the corrosion layered high and middle mountain region (Zone I), and three counties (Wulong, Pengshui and Shizhu counties) in southeastern Chongqing, delineated as the middle mountainous region of strong karst gorges (Zone II), as the study area. This study used a Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of the LightGBM and XGBoost models and construct evaluation models for each of the two regions. The model with high accuracy was selected according to the accuracy of the evaluation indicators in order to establish the landslide susceptibility mapping. The SHAP algorithm was then used to explore the landslide formation mechanisms of different landforms from both a global and local perspective. (3) Results: The AUC values for the test set in the LightGBM mode for Zones I and II are 0.8525 and 0.8859, respectively, and those for the test set in the XGBoost model are 0.8214 and 0.8375, respectively. This shows that LightGBM has a high prediction accuracy with regard to both landforms. Under the two different landform types, the elevation, land use, incision depth, distance from road and the average annual rainfall were the common dominant factors contributing most to decision making at both sites; the distance from a fault and the distance from the river have different degrees of influence under different landform types. (4) Conclusions: the optimized LightGBM-SHAP model is suitable for the analysis of landslide susceptibility in two types of landscapes, namely the corrosion layered high and middle mountain region, and the middle mountainous region of strong karst gorges, and can be used to explore the internal decision-making mechanism of the model at both the global and local levels, which makes the landslide susceptibility prediction results more realistic and transparent. This is beneficial to the selection of a landslide susceptibility index system and the early prevention and control of landslide hazards, and can provide a reference for the prediction of potential landslide hazard-prone areas and interpretable machine learning research. © 2023 by the authors.",Land,10.3390/land12051018,8,8,Yes,"LGBM,XGB,SHAP",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To effectively manage land use and reduce the risk of landslides, it is crucial to conduct susceptibility assessments. To date, many machine-learning methods have been applied to the landslide susceptibility map (LSM). However, as a risk prediction, landslide susceptibility without good interpretability would be a risky approach to apply these methods to real life. This study aimed to assess the LSM in the region of Nayong in Guizhou, China, and conduct a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of landslide susceptibility maps utilizing an explainable artificial intelligence. This study incorporates remote sensing data, field surveys, geographic information system techniques, and interpretable machine-learning techniques to analyze the sensitivity to landslides and to contrast it with other conventional models. As an interpretable machine-learning method, generalized additive models with structured interactions (GAMI-net) could be used to understand how LSM models make decisions. The results showed that the GAMI-net model was valid and had an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is better than the values of 0.85 and 0.81 for the random forest and SVM models, respectively. The coal mining, rock desertification, and rainfall greater than 1300 mm were more susceptible to landslides in the study area. Additionally, the pairwise interaction factors, such as rainfall and mining, lithology and rainfall, and rainfall and elevation, also increased the landslide susceptibility. The results showed that interpretable models could accurately predict landslide susceptibility and reveal the causes of landslide occurrence.

In the last decade, statistical methods have gradually exerted their impact on mapping the landslide susceptibility to locate the high-risk places of landslide. However, due to the complexity of getting full access to the thematic information in large scenarios, most of these statistical methods generally suffer from overfitting, inadequate representative power, and the inability to transfer the learned representation to other places. To solve these challenges, this study designed an unsupervised representation learning module, which features independence, compactness, robustness, and transferability. Specifically, we first stack restricted Boltzmann machines and denoising autoencoder to unsupervised discover the underlying representations embedded in the thematic maps. Then, we applied the transferring strategy in an adversarial manner to generalize the learned representations to the sample-scarce area. Experimental results and analyses using data in different regions have revealed that the proposed method can be generalized well between different LSM scenarios. In terms of precision, it outperforms other methods by a large margin, e.g., by around 7% compared to multilayer perceptrons with the same configuration, and by 3%-4% to the state of art algorithm random forest. Besides, compared to other methods, the landslide susceptibility map that is predicted by the proposed method featuring smoothness and stableness seems more reliable, and is more according to some prior knowledge that, for example, distance to the drainage, slope, and stratum, should exert dominant effects on the occurrence of a landslide. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,10.1109/jstars.2020.3006192,32,8,Yes,"RBM,AE,RF,SVM,ANN",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many landslide casual factors are often generated from DEMs. Most studies on landslide susceptibility assessments rely on freely available DEMs. However, very little is known about the performance of different DEMs with varying spatial resolutions on the accurate assessment of landslide susceptibility. This study compared the performance of four different DEMs including 30 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), 30-90 m Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 12.5 m Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array Type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and 25 m Survey of Bangladesh (SOB) DEM in landslide susceptibility assessment in the Rangamati district in Bangladesh. This study used three different landslide susceptibility assessment techniques: modified frequency ratio (bivariate model), logistic regression (multivariate model), and random forest (machine-learning model). This study explored two scenarios of landslide susceptibility assessment: using only DEM-derived causal factors and using both DEM-derived factors as well as other common factors. The success and prediction rate curves indicate that the SRTM DEM provides the highest accuracies for the bivariate model in both scenarios. Results also reveal that the ALOS PALSAR DEM shows the best performance in landslide susceptibility mapping using the logistics regression and the random forest models. A relatively finer resolution DEM, the SOB DEM, shows the lowest accuracies compared to other DEMs for all models and scenarios. It can also be noted that the performance of all DEMs except the SOB DEM is close (72%-84%) considering the success and prediction accuracies. Therefore, anyone of the three global DEMs: ASTER, SRTM, and ALOS PALSAR can be used for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area. © 2020 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs12172718,30,8,Yes,"LOGR,RF",,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A landslide inventory map along with sixteen landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) was used. Randomly partitioned sets of 70%:30% were used to ascertain the goodness of fit and predictive ability of the models. The contribution of LCFs was analyzed using the RF model. The altitude and drainage density were found to be the responsible factors in causing the landslide in the study area according to the RF model. The robustness of models was assessed through three threshold dependent measures, i.e., receiver operating characteristic (ROC), precision and accuracy, and two threshold independent measures, i.e., mean-absolute-error (MAE) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE). Finally, using the compound factor (CF) method, the models were prioritized based on the results of the validation methods to choose best model. Results show that ANN-RF-LR indicated a realistic finding, concentrating only on 17.74% of the study area as highly susceptible to landslide. The ANN-RF-LR ensemble demonstrated the highest goodness of fit and predictive capacity with respective values of 87.83% (area under the success rate curve) and 93.98% (area under prediction rate curve), and the highest robustness correspondingly. These attempts will play a significant role in ensemble modeling, in building reliable and comprehensive models.

Climatic, topographic, geological, social, and morphological factors were the main input variables used. The data were obtained from several sources. The accuracies of GLM, SVM, and functional discriminant analysis (FDA) models indicate that SVM is the most accurate for predicting landslides, land subsidence, and flood hazards in the study area. GLM is the best algorithm for wildfire mapping, and FDA is the most accurate model for predicting snow avalanche risk. The values of AUC (area under curve) for all five hazards using the best models are greater than 0.8, demonstrating that the modelâs predictive abilities are acceptable. A machine learning approach can prove to be very useful tool for hazard management and disaster mitigation, particularly for multi-hazard modeling.

However, delineating the spatial occurrence pattern of the landslide remains a challenge. This study investigates the potential application of the stacking ensemble learning technique for landslide susceptibility assessment. In particular, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), logical regression (LR), and naive Bayes (NB) were selected as base learners for the stacking ensemble method. The resampling scheme and Pearson's correlation analysis were jointly used to evaluate the importance level of these base learners. A total of 388 landslides and 12 conditioning factors in the Lushui area (Southwest China) were used as the dataset to develop landslide modeling. The landslides were randomly separated into two parts, with 70% used for model training and 30% used for model validation. The models' performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and statistical measures. The results showed that the stacking-based ensemble model achieved an improved predictive accuracy as compared to the single algorithms, while the SVM-ANN-NB-LR (SANL) model, the SVM-ANN-NB (SAN) model, and the ANN-NB-LR (ANL) models performed equally well, with AUC values of 0.931, 0.940, and 0.932, respectively, for validation stage. The correlation coefficient between the LR and SVM was the highest for all resampling rounds, with a value of 0.72 on average. This connotes that LR and SVM played an almost equal role when the ensemble of SANL was applied for landslide susceptibility analysis. Therefore, it is feasible to use the SAN model or the ANL model for the study area. The finding from this study suggests that the stacking ensemble machine learning method is promising for landslide susceptibility mapping in the Lushui area and is capable of targeting areas prone to landslides.

Considering complex internal relations among the triggering factors, logistic regression (LR) and shallow neural networks, such as back-propagation neural network (BPNN), are often limited. In this paper, we make a straightforward development that the deep belief network (DBN) based on deep learning technology is introduced to map the regional susceptibility to landslides. Seven factors with respect to geomorphology, geology and hydrology are considered and verified through the collinearity test. A DBN model containing three pre-trained layers of restricted Boltzmann machines by stochastic gradient descent method is configured to obtain the susceptibility to landslides. Susceptibility results evaluated byÂ DBN model are compared with those by LR and BPNN in the receive operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, showing that DBN has a better prediction precision, with a lower rate of false alarms and fake alarms. The case study also indicates different sensitivities of the triggering factors to the landslide susceptibility, that the factors of altitude, distance to drainage network and average annual rainfall have significant impact in mapping the susceptibility to landslides in the region. This research will contribute to a better-performance model for regional-scale mapping for the susceptibility to landslides, in particular, at the area where triggering factors show complex relations and relative independence.

The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the âreach angleâ method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed.

Traditionally, such maps are generated with visual interpretation of remote sensing imagery (manned/unmanned airborne systems or spaceborne sensors) and/or using pixel-based and object-based methods exploiting data-intensive machine learning algorithms. Recent works have explored the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning algorithm, for mapping landslides from remote sensing data. These methods follow a standard supervised learning workflow that involves training a model using a landslide inventory covering a relatively small area. The trained model is then used to predict landslides in the surrounding regions. Here, we propose a new strategy, i.e., a progressive CNN training relying on combined inventories to build a generalized model that can be applied directly to a new, unexplored area. We first prove the effectiveness of CNNs by training and validating on event landslides inventories in four regions after earthquakes and/or extreme meteorological events. Next, we use the trained CNNs to map landslides triggered by new events spread across different geographic regions. We found that CNNs trained on a combination of inventories have a better generalization performance, with a bias towards high precision and low recall scores. In our tests, the combined training model achieved the highest (Matthews correlation coefficient) MCC score of 0.69 when mapping landslides in new unseen regions. The mapping was done on images from different optical sensors, resampled to a spatial resolution of 6 m, 10 m, and 30 m. Despite a slightly reduced performance, the main advantage of combined training is to overcome the requirement of a local inventory for training a new deep learning model. This implementation can facilitate automated pipelines providing fast response for the generation of landslide maps in the post-disaster phase. In this study, the study areas were selected from seismically active zones with a high hydrological hazard distribution and vegetation coverage. Hence, future works should also include regions from less vegetated geographic locations.

Given the recent advances in the field of image processing, the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a deep convolutional neural network architecture called U-Net for the mapping of landslide scars from satellite imagery. The question that drives the study is: can fully convolutional neural networks be successfully applied as the backbone of automatic frameworks for building landslide inventories, keeping or improving the identification accuracy and agility when compared to other methods? To seek for an answer to it, scenes from the Landsat-8 satellite of a region of Nepal were obtained and processed in order to compose a landslide image database that served as the basis for the training, validation and test of deep convolutional neural networks. The U-Net architecture was applied and the results indicate that it has the potential to identify landslide scars, improving over previously published research on the topic for the same study region. The validation process resulted in recall, precision and F1-score values of 0.74, 0.61 and 0.67, respectively, thus higher than those from previous studies using different methodologies. The results indicate the potential of the method to be applied in dynamic mapping systems for landslide scar identification, which paves the way to the composition and updating of landslide scar databases.

In the field of risk analysis, with particular reference to landslide hazard, images generated by autonomous platforms (such as UAVs, ground-based acquisition systems, satellite sensors) and pictures obtained from web data mining are easily gathered and contribute to the fast surge in the amount of non-organized information that may engulf data storage facilities. Therefore, the high potential impact of such methods is severely reduced by the need of a massive amount of human intelligence tasks (HITs), which is necessary to filter and classify the data, whatever the final purpose. In this work, we present a new set of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) specifically designed for the automated recognition of landslides and mass movements in non-standard pictures that can be used in automated image classification, in supporting UAV autonomous guidance and in the filtering of data-mined information. Computer vision can be of great help in fostering the autonomous capability of intelligent systems to complement, or completely substitute, HITs. Image and object recognition are at the forefront of this research field. The deep learning procedure has been accomplished by applying transfer learning to some of the top-performer CNNs available in the literature. Results show that the deep learning machines, calibrated on a relevant dataset of validated images of landforms, may supply reliable predictions with computational time and resource requirements compatible with most of the UAV platforms and web data mining applications in landslide hazard studies. Average accuracy achieved by the proposed methods ranges between 87 and 90% and is consistently higher than that obtained by general-purpose state-of-the-art image recognition convolutional neural networks. The method can be applied to early warning, vulnerability assessment, residual risk estimation, model parameterisation and landslide mapping.

EKW is one of the resourceful wetland ecosystems of the world which offers a bundle of direct and indirect ecosystem services to the Kolkata megacity region. The rapid expansion of built-up in the surrounding urban agglomeration of the EKW is putting immense pressure on the EKW and the rate of wetland loss has been highest in recent decades. To ensure that this distinct ecosystem is conserved, an efficient means of identifying wetland conversion risk is needed. This study aims to assess the risk of EKW conversion using two advanced data-driven Machine Learning (ML) models, viz, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The novelty of the paper is in the fact that ML models have been widely applied to groundwater potential, flood susceptibility, and landslide susceptibility, their applicability to wetland conversion risk assessment has not yet been explored. The advantage of RF and SVM is that both of the ML models can overcome the limitations of pre-assumption based conventional methods of wetland risk assessment. A total of eight factors are selected which can be categorized into ecological, bio-physical, demographic, and physical infrastructure groups. Both results indicate that around 60% area under medium to very high-risk zones. A comparison is also made between these two methods to identify the most precise prediction method for this study area. The results of the models are quantitatively validated applying the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) method, where both of this method identifies SVM as a more precise predictive model for this study with 91.12% accuracy. The spatial pattern of encroachment and shrinkage of EKW triggered by urban expansion is successfully captured by RF and ME. Policy analysts and land-use planners can use the outcome derived from RF and SVM models and associated maps to identify the risk zones, assess the effectiveness of wetland conservation programs, design effective policies to stop further degradation of the wetlands, and adopt long-term sustainable planning for this precious ecosystem.

During the event, flash floods and several landslides caused losses of lives, evacuation of people from their homes, collapses of infrastructure and large constructions, destruction of agricultural fields, and many other economic losses. The meteorological conditions before and during the flood were analyzed here and compared with long-term records. The flood extent and the landslide susceptibility were investigated by using multisensor and multitemporal data. Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-2 optical data, and aerial photogrammetric datasets were employed for the investigations using machine learning techniques. The changes were assessed both at a local and regional level and evaluated together with available damage reports. The analysis of the rainfall data recorded during the two weeks before the floods and landslides in heavily affected regions shows that the rainfall continued for consecutive hours with an amount of up to 68 mm/hour. The regional level classification results obtained from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data by using the random forest (RF) method exhibit 97% accuracy for the flood class. The landslide susceptibility prediction performance from aerial photogrammetric datasets was 92% represented by the Area Under Curve (AUC) value provided by the RF method. The results presented here show that considering the occurrence frequency and immense damages after such events, the use of novel remote sensing technologies and spatial analysis methods is unavoidable for disaster mitigation efforts and for the monitoring of environmental effects. Although the increasing number of earth observation satellites complemented with airborne imaging sensors is capable of ensuring data collection requirement with diverse spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions, further studies are required to automate the data processing, efficient information extraction, and data fusion and also to increase the accuracy of the results.

Accurate segmentation and measurement of loess landslides is crucial to documenting their occurrence and extent and investigating the distribution, types, and patterns of slope failures. The measurement of landslides also assists in assessing their susceptibility and risk. Herein, a novel loess landslide segmentation and measurement framework based on deep learning is proposed. Multiple experts label the ground-truth landslide regions, and simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) masks are generated. The U-Net segmentation algorithm is trained using a supervised approach to segment the loess landslide region. The fully connected conditional random field is integrated into the U-Net to further optimize the segmentation quality. In the final step, the predicted landslide boundaries are visualized, and the diameters (e.g., length and width) of the segmentation outcome are computed simultaneously. Four state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms are selected for the comparative analysis.

On the other hand, feature engineering (FE) is an important topic in ML studies, but the concept is ignored by most research. In this study, a novel FE framework, including feature selection, feature transformation, feature binning, and feature weighting, is proposed to produce LSMs using eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). For this purpose, first, thirteen landslide conditioning factors used in data preprocessing were utilized for producing LSM models in the study area, Babadag district of Denizli Province in the Aegean region of Turkey. Second, two irrelevant factors eliminated from the input feature subset using the feature selection in the FE framework. Third, features determined as skewed data were converted into symmetric form by applying feature transformation analysis with log transformation. Then, the remaining factors having continuous values were turned into categorical values using the quantile classifier technique. During the feature weighting phase, four different feature weighting methods, namely, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, random forest (RF), non-negative least squares (NNLS), and Frequency Ratio, were utilized to calculate the weights in each subclass of each landslide-related factor. In addition, the proposed feature subsets were also compared with raw data. At the end of process, the XGBoost model constructed with a FR-selected subset (Overall Accuracy (Acc) = 0.907 and area under curve (AUC) = 0.9822) outperformed both raw (Acc = 0.874; AUC = 0.960) and other methods (i.e., RF–FR and SVM–NNLS). Consequently, the study results revealed that the proposed FE approach could be a useful framework to increase the performance of ML techniques in identifying and extracting relevant features to develop highly optimized and enriched models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,10.1007/s00477-022-02330-y,7,7,Yes,"XBG,RF,SVM",,Turkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basin is part of the Jazan region in southwestern Saudi Arabia and is characterized by mountainous terrain. Recently, this area has experienced many extreme natural processes, which become natural hazard events when they intersect with human activities (urban areas and infrastructures). In this work, the probabilities of the three main hazards; landslides, floods, and gully erosion are mapped using machine learning algorithms such as boosted regression tree (BRT), generalized linear model (GLM), Flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), random forest (RF), and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA). Several factors from various sources, including, topographic, geologic, meteorological, hydrologic, and human activities, were incorporated to produce the final multi-hazard susceptibility model. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the best predictive model for each type of natural hazard. AUC values between 80 and 90% indicated that the model was very good, and values above 90% indicated that the model had excellent predictive capability. Based on the accuracy evaluation, the FDA model was found to be the most accurate landslides prediction with an AUC value of (92.7%, excellent performance). The RF model was found to be the most accurate in predicting floods and erosion with AUC values of (97.2% - excellent and 83.3% - very good performance, respectively). Finally, a map of multi-hazard susceptibility was created by coupling of the mentioned three hazards. The results showed that 33.5% of the total area is safe (no-hazard), while 66.5% is characterized by at least a single hazard and a combination of two or three hazards.

However, in order to perform such investigations, multi-temporal (MT) inventories of landslides are required. The traditional approach of visual interpretation from cloud-free optical remote sensing imageries is time consuming and expensive. Recent endeavors exploring Convolutional Neural Networks and deep learning models have made rapid and accurate mapping of landslides feasible but have not been applied for multi-temporal landslide mapping in the Himalayas, yet. Earlier models used a standard supervised learning approach, with a small landslide inventory over a limited area used for training, which is then utilized to predict landslides in nearby areas. We propose a new strategy, using geographically separate training samples to design a standard approach which can be utilized to create multi-temporal landslide inventories. RapidEye images of 5-meters spatial resolution are used to generate MT landslide inventories in the study area of Rasuwa district, Nepal. We test the effectiveness of the model by training with only 55 landslides and predicting for a different area. Then, using the weights attained from this first training phase, we use transfer learning to map landslides over a time period between 2013 and 2019 in the Rasuwa district attaining an average F1-score of 0.69 for the study area. We also perform a spatial comparison between the manual (observed) and predicted inventories to evaluate the differences between landslide densities and overall landslide statistics of landslide area distribution. The benefit of a transfer learning-based model training is that it circumvents the need for generating annual inventories for training a deep learning. A single event-based inventory is enough to generate landslide inventories over a number of years, at least until landslide conditioning factors do not change significantly. This application can enable automated workflows to generate MT landslide inventories of particular areas as the basis for landslide evolution and movement change analysis. © 2023 The Author(s).

A first step towards securing lives and infrastructure is the susceptibility mapping and predicting of occurrence sites of FF. Several studies have been applied using an ensemble machine learning model (EMLM) but measuring FF magnitude using a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (MCL) and geohydrological models have not been widely applied. This study aims to modify a hybrid approach by testing three machine learning models. These are boosted regression tree (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), and naive Bayes tree (NBT) for FF susceptibility mapping at the northern part of the United Arab Emirates (NUAE). This is followed by applying a group of accuracy metrics (precision, recall and F1 score) and the receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The result demonstrated that the BRT has the highest performance for FF susceptibility mapping followed by the CART and NBT. After that, the produced FF map using the BRT was then modified by dividing it into seven basins, and a set of new FF conditioning parameters namely alluvial plain width, basin gradient and mean slope for each basin was calculated for measuring FF magnitude. The results showed that the mountainous and narrower basins (e.g., RAK, Masafi, Fujairah, and Rol Dadnah) have the highest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude, while the wider alluvial plains (e.g., Al Dhaid) have the lowest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude. The proposed approach is an effective approach to improve the susceptibility mapping of FF, landslides, land subsidence, and groundwater potentiality obtained using ensemble machine learning, which is used widely in the literature. © 2020 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs12172695,25,7,No,,,United Arab Emirates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike traditional methods for drawing LIM, the proposed DP-FCN directly draws LIMs from the bitemporal aerial images with VHR through a trained deep neural network without generating the change magnitude map. Thus, the proposed approach can effectively reduce the effects of pseudo changes caused by phenological differences rather than landslide events. The proposed DP-FCN model contains two modules, namely, deep feature extraction, and joint feature learning networks. Deep feature extraction aims to reduce redundancy while extracting the high-level deep features from bitemporal images. Joint feature learning establishes the relationship between the deep features of bitemporal images and the ground reference map. Experiments on the real datasets of the landslide sites in Lantau Island of Hong Kong, China, demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach in drawing LIM with VHR remote sensing images.

We first used 20 conditioning factors and then they were tested by information gain ratio (IGR) technique to select the most important ones. We then constructed a geodatabase based on the selected factors along with a total of 111 landslide locations with a ratio of 80/20 (for calibration/validation). The performance of the models was checked by the true positive rate (TP Rate), false positive rate (FP Rate), precision, recall, FI-Measure, Kappa, mean absolute error, and area under the receiver operatic curve (AUC). Results of IGR specified that the slope angle and TWI had the most contribution to shallow landslide occurrence in the study area. Moreover, results concluded that although these models had a high goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, the CART model (AUC=0.856) outperformed the REPTree model (AUC=0.837).

For this purpose we compare the predictive performances achieved using terrain attributes derived from TanDEM-X DEM (12 m resolution and resampled to 30 m), ASTER DEM (30 m), SRTM DEM (30 m), and a DEM (25 m) interpolated from contour lines (1:25.000 map scale), exploiting the capabilities of logistic regression, generalized additive models, random forests and support vector machines. The study was conducted in the Buz?u Sector of the Curvature Subcarpathians of Romania, a region highly susceptible to landslides. While the performances varied little among modelling techniques, the use of different DEMs strongly influenced the cross-validation accuracy of landslide susceptibility models. TanDEM-X (12 m) based susceptibility models outperformed models based on the other DEMs (median Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUROC) values 0.708â0.730). Models using ASTER-derived terrain attributes showed the poorest predictive capabilities (median AUROC 0.568â0.595). We conclude that the quality of DEMs is of critical importance in landslide susceptibility modelling, and greater efforts should be made to obtain suitable DEM products.

Application of machine learning (ML) with geographic information system (GIS) is a promising fusion of technologies, for spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility with high precision, and has been applied widely in the past. However, the literatures of ML and GIS-based LSZ gives a fuzzy conclusion upon the righteous choice of ML technique among many state-of-the-art techniques, and do not present a probe on the aptitude of ML models for township level LSZ attempts. This research investigates such concern with a case study to figure out a robust technique, which can be a benchmark approach in future case studies and various comparisons strives across the sundry genre of ML. For that, the present attempt has been anchored to four different supervised ML algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM) of neural network (NN) genre, classical ML algorithm of support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ELANFIS) of neuro-fuzzy system genre. The Mussoorie Township, a famed hill station in the Indian State of Uttarakhand was chosen as the area for case study. A total of 13 landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) were produced. Spatial performance of these maps was compared and statistically validated with the help of landslide inventory of the study area. Amongst the LSMs, the LSM-ELANFIS-VII of ELANFIS model with 11 number of membership functions (MF) was found to be in better agreement with all the validation measures performed. In addition to the satisfactory performance on validation, the LSMs produced through ELANFIS display a unique trace of geomorphological features on it along with pragmatic scattering of landslide susceptibility classes - an omen that exhorts graduation of GIS-based LSZ to ensemble neuro-fuzzy ML models.

The area of Jabal Farasan in the northwest Jeddah of Saudi Arabia suffers from landslide events. The main cause of these events was identified due to the anthropogenic activities represented by mining activities. In this work, different machine learning algorithms (MLA), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) were implemented to predict the landslides events integrated with remote sensing data. The objective is to generate landslides susceptibility prediction map using different MLA. The landslides inventory map was prepared in the present study based on the historical landslideâs events. Landslides at 1354 locations were used to train the models and validate the prediction. Landslides controlling factors include: elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, distance from roads, lineaments density, and topographic wetness index (TWI). Our findings indicate that landslides more likely occurs in the areas of mining activities, close to the roads and the Wadi tributaries due to the high slope angle in some cases. Subsequently, the prediction maps were classified into landslide occurrence location and non-landslides occurrenceâs model's validation using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the model accuracy varied between 86 and 89% for RF, KNN, and NB. The produced landslide susceptibility map in this study would provide useful information for hazard management and control in such natural hazards.

The goal of this study was to apply four deep learning algorithms, the convolutional neural network (CNN), deep neural network (DNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and recurrent neural network (RNN) in evaluating the possibility of landslides throughout Maoxian County, Sichuan, China. A total of 1290 landslide records was developed using historical records, field observations, and remote sensing techniques. The landslide susceptibility maps showed that most susceptible areas were along the Minjiang River and in some parts of the southeastern portion of the study area. Slope, rainfall, and distance to faults were the most influential factors affecting landslide occurrence. Results revealed that proportion of landslide susceptible areas in Maoxian County was as follows: identified landslides (13.65â23.71%) and non-landslides (76.29â86.35%). The resultant maps were tested against known landslide locations using the area under the curve (AUC). This study indicated that the DNN algorithm performed better than LSTM, CNN, and RNN in identifying landslides in Maoxian County, with AUC values (for prediction accuracy) of 87.30%, 86.50%, 85.60%, and 82.90%, respectively.

The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), like many mountainous regions, is the site of multiple and overlapping natural hazards, but the distribution of multi-hazard risk and the populations exposed to it are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution transboundary models describing susceptibility to floods, landslides, and wildfires to understand population exposure to multi-hazard risk across the HKH. These models are created from historical remotely sensed data and hazard catalogs by the maximum entropy (Maxent) machine learning technique. Our results show that human settlements in the HKH are disproportionately concentrated in areas of high multi-hazard risk. In contrast, low-hazard areas are disproportionately unpopulated. Nearly half of the population in the region lives in areas that are highly susceptible to more than one hazard. Warm low-altitude foothill areas with perennially moist soils were identified as highly susceptible to multiple hazards. This area comprises only 31% of the study region, but is home to 49% of its population. The results also show that areas susceptible to multiple hazards are also major corridors of current migration and urban expansion, suggesting that current rates and patterns of urbanization will continue to put more people at risk. This study establishes that the population in the HKH is concentrated in areas susceptible to multiple hazards and suggests that current patterns of human movement will continue to increase exposure to multi-hazards in the HKH.

We developed two novel hybrid predictive models that combine the self-organizing, deep-learning group method of data handling (GMDH) with two swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, i.e., cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for spatially explicit prediction of landslide susceptibility. Eleven landslide-causing factors and 334 historic landslides in a 31,340 km2 landslide-prone area in Iran were used to produce geospatial training and validation datasets. The GMDH model was employed to develop a basic predictive model that was then restructured and its parameters were optimized using the CSA and WOA algorithms, yielding the novel hybrid GMDH-CSA and GMDH-WOA models. The hybrid models were validated and compared to the standalone GMDH model by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve and root mean square error (RMSE). The results demonstrated that the hybrid models overcame the computational shortcomings of the basic GMDH model and significantly improved landslide susceptibility prediction (GMDH-CSA, AUC = 0.909 and RMSE = 0.089; GMDH-WOA, AUC = 0.902 and RMSE = 0.129; standalone GMDH, AUC = 0.791 and RMSE = 0.226). Further, the hybrid models were more robust than the standalone GMDH model, showing consistently excellent performance when the training and validation datasets were changed.

To better understand this global hazard, the Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model was developed previously. LHASA version 1 combines satellite precipitation estimates with a global landslide susceptibility map to produce a gridded map of potentially hazardous areas from 60Â° North-South every 3Â h. LHASA version 1 categorizes the worldâs land surface into three ratings: high, moderate, and low hazard with a single decision tree that first determines if the last seven days of rainfall were intense, then evaluates landslide susceptibility. LHASA version 2 has been developed with a data-driven approach. The global susceptibility map was replaced with a collection of explanatory variables, and two new dynamically varying quantities were added: snow and soil moisture. Along with antecedent rainfall, these variables modulated the response to current daily rainfall. In addition, the Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was supplemented with several inventories of rainfall-triggered landslide events. These factors were incorporated into the machine-learning framework XGBoost, which was trained to predict the presence or absence of landslides over the period 2015â2018, with the years 2019â2020 reserved for model evaluation. As a result of these improvements, the new global landslide nowcast was twice as likely to predict the occurrence of historical landslides as LHASA version 1, given the same global false positive rate. Furthermore, the shift to probabilistic outputs allows users to directly manage the trade-off between false negatives and false positives, which should make the nowcast useful for a greater variety of geographic settings and applications. In a retrospective analysis, the trained model ran over a global domain for 5Â years, and results for LHASA version 1 and version 2 were compared. Due to the importance of rainfall and faults in LHASA version 2, nowcasts would be issued more frequently in some tropical countries, such as Colombia and Papua New Guinea; at the same time, the new version placed less emphasis on arid regions and areas far from the Pacific Rim. LHASA version 2 provides a nearly real-time view of global landslide hazard for a variety of stakeholders.

The EQIL inventories are generated mostly by the traditional or semisupervised mapping approaches, which required a parameter's tuning or binary threshold decision in the practical application. In this study, we investigated the impact of optical data from the PlanetScope sensor and topographic factors from the ALOS sensor on EQIL mapping using a deep-learning convolution neural network (CNN). Thus, six training datasets were prepared and used to evaluate the performance of the CNN model using only optical data and using these data along with each and all topographic factors across the west coast of the Trishuli river in Nepal. For the first time, the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) model was applied for combining the resulting maps from each CNN stream that trained with different datasets. Finally, seven different resulting maps were compared against a detailed and accurate inventory of landslide polygons by a mean intersection-over-union (mIOU). Our results confirm that using the training dataset of the spectral information along with the topographic factor of the slope is helpful to distinguish the landslide bodies from other similar features, such as barren lands, and consequently increases the mapping accuracy. The improvement of the mIOU was a range from approximately zero to more than 17%. Moreover, the D-S model can be considered as an optimizer method to combine the results from different scenarios.

Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment.

However, simple analysis techniques like thresholding cannot detect and classify complex deformation signals reliably making providing usable information to a broad range of nonexpert stakeholders a challenge. Here, we explore the applicability of deep learning approaches by adapting a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect deformation in a national-scale velocity field. For our proof-of-concept, we focus on the U.K. where previously identified deformation is associated with coal-mining, ground water withdrawal, landslides, and tunneling. The sparsity of measurement points and the presence of spike noise make this a challenging application for deep learning networks, which involve calculations of the spatial convolution between images. Moreover, insufficient ground truth data exist to construct a balanced training data set, and the deformation signals are slower and more localized than in previous applications. We propose three enhancement methods to tackle these problems: 1) spatial interpolation with modified matrix completion; 2) a synthetic training data set based on the characteristics of the real U.K. velocity map; and 3) enhanced overwrapping techniques. Using velocity maps spanning 20152019, our framework detects several areas of coal mining subsidence, uplift due to dewatering, slate quarries, landslides, and tunnel engineering works.

On the basis of a detailed inspection of the high-resolution aerial photographs collected from the UAV photogrammetry and historical satellite imagery, subsurface strati-graphic configuration revealed from borehole explorations and the local rainfall data collected, the failure mechanism of this landslide is investigated. The occurrence of this landslide is probably attributed to the combined influence of the long-term rainfall and the engineering activities at this site. An automatic landslide cracks recognition model, which is based on the deep learning-based image recognition technique of RetinaNet, is further developed to map the cracks at the landslide site. The effectiveness of this automatic crack recognition model is validated through quantitative comparisons between the landslide cracks recognized and the field survey results. Based upon the landslide cracks identified on two different dates after this landslide event (by the field survey and automatic crack recognition model) and the subsurface displacement revealed from a drilled hole, the evolution behavior of this landslide is analyzed. The results show that the stability of this landslide was not achieved during the first slide in June 2018 and the limit of the landslide was increased much from June to November 2018. In such a situation, the elements at risk in the zones that are potentially impacted by this landslide are identified (with the aid of the UAV images collected), and a preliminary consequence assessment is conducted.",ENGINEERING GEOLOGY,10.1016/j.enggeo.2021.106172,18,6,No,,,"Peoples R China,Taiwan,Japan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data showed that every year, around 400 fatalities occur in Himalayan terrain due to landslide. In the current study, we have mapped the landslide susceptibility zones in the segment of Garhwal Himalaya using robust machine and deep learning algorithms. Individual machine and deep learning models have its own limitations like low generation capacity with nonlinear functions to describe the intricate relationship among predictors. In this study total five models i.e., SVM (Support Vector Machine), RF (Random Forest), bagging, ANN (Artificial Neural Network), DLNN (Deep Learning Neural Network) have been used along with twenty landslide controlling factors. Here, the principal objective of the study is to precisely delineate landslide susceptibility zones of the Garhwal Himalaya. The selecting factors have been considered through multi-collinearity test and information gain ratio statistics and the previous landslide points have been taken as training (70%) and testing (30%) dataset. According to area under curve value (AUC), the DLNN technique has high capability (AUC = 0.925) and accuracy for landslide area demarcation. The approach of integrated physical and social factors creates more precise prediction aptitude that can support large scale landslide management.

The data necessary for landslide susceptibility mapping is a collection of landslide causative factors as predictors and landslide inventory as a response variable; however, landslides do not occur everywhere, and the occurrence of landslides is limited in an area. This geophysical phenomenon leads to severely skewed class distribution, wherein the number of landslide samples (minority class) is significantly less than non-landslide locations (majority class). The imbalance in landslide data hampers the predictive ability of learning algorithms, and hence, the final models show poor performance in the class with fewer samples. This work uses two undersampling techniques, namely, EasyEnsemble (EE) and BalanceCascade (BC), for reducing the effect of imbalance in data. The landslides that occurred between 2004 and 2013 are randomly divided into two groups, i.e., 70% of the samples for training and 30% for testing, whereas the landslides that occurred between 2014 and 2017 have been used for validation. The balanced data is used with the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), thereby making four new approaches, i.e., EESVM, EEANN, BCSVM, and BCANN, for susceptibility mapping. We used several metrics, such as recall, geometric mean, precision, accuracy, and Heidke skill score, to evaluate the performance of landslide susceptibility maps. The AUC for imbalanced data with SVM and ANN is 0.50, which shows that the model cannot discriminate between landslide and non-landslide locations. This misclassification is due to a small number of landslide samples and serious class biases. The balanced data using EE and BC methods gives promising results and shows significant improvements, wherein the AUC of EESVM, EEANN, BCSVM, and BCANN is 0.869, 0.918, 0.881, and 0.923, respectively. Among all the methods, the recall and G-mean values were highest for EEANN, which represents the best separation performance of EEANN on landslide samples. Furthermore, we have used the standard error (SE) of AUC and 95% confidence interval to test the significance of various combinations of classification and undersampling schemes. The SE is highest for EESVM and BCSVM among all methods. Based on several accuracy metrics, we conclude that EEANN performs better than all the other methods. The BC-based method does not perform well for landslide susceptibility mapping and provides the highest misclassification of landslide samples. The study shows that the susceptibility maps prepared over balanced data using SVM and ANN show remarkable improvements in accuracy over imbalanced data. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Landslides,10.1007/s10346-022-01998-1,6,6,Yes,"SVM,ANN",,"India,Israel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, a landslide inventory map was created with 206 historical landslide points and 412 non-landslide points, which was randomly divided into two datasets for model training (80%) and model testing (20%). Second, a landslide factor database was initially established by selecting 15 landslide conditioning factors from the topography, hydrology, climate, geology, and artificial activities. Thereafter, the multicollinearity test and information gain ratio (IGR) technique were applied to rank the importance of the factors. Subsequently, we used a series of metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure, area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC), kappa index, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE)) to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the six models. Based on the AUC values derived from the models, the GBDT + LR model with the highest AUC value (0.8168) was identified as the most efficient model for mapping landslide susceptibility, followed by the XGB + LR, XGB, RF + LR, GBDT, and RF models, which achieved AUC values of 0.8124, 0.8118, 0.8060, 0.7927, and 0.7883, respectively.

The landslides caused by the 2005 Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These machine learning models are innovative and can assess environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI, Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5%), 0.893 (89.3%), and 0.790 (79.0%), respectively. Based on the three machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895, and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers. Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and infrastructural areas. © 2022 by the authors.",Civil Engineering Journal (Iran),10.28991/cej-2022-08-02-02,12,6,Yes,"XGB,RF,KNN",,"China,Pakistan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The statistical or machine learning methods for selecting DSM covariates are not available for those situations with limited samples. To solve the problem, this paper proposed a case-based method which could formalize the covariate selection knowledge contained in practical DSM applications. The proposed method trained Random Forest (RF) classifiers with DSM cases extracted from the practical DSM applications and then used the trained classifiers to determine whether each one potential covariate should be used in a new DSM application. In this study, we took topographic covariates as examples of covariates and extracted 191 DSM cases from 56 peer-reviewed journal articles to evaluate the performance of the proposed case-based method by Leave-One-Out cross validation. Compared with a novices’ commonly-used way of selecting DSM covariates, the proposed case-based method improved more than 30% accuracy according to three quantitative evaluation indices (i.e., recall, precision, and F1-score). The proposed method could be also applied to selecting the proper set of covariates for other similar geographical modeling domains, such as landslide susceptibility mapping, and species distribution modeling. © 2020 CAAS.

Box 2455, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia",Systematic sample subdividing strategy for training landslide susceptibility models,GIS; Hellinger distance; Landslide modelling; Outlier detection; Sampling strategy,"Current practice in choosing training samples for landslide susceptibility modelling (LSM) is to randomly subdivide inventory information into training and testing samples. Where inventory data differ in distribution, the selection of training samples by a random process may cause inefficient training of machine learning (ML)/statistical models. A systematic technique may, however, produce efficient training samples that well represent the entire inventory data. This is particularly true when inventory information is scarce. This research proposed a systemic strategy to deal with this problem based on the fundamental distribution of probabilities (i.e. Hellinger) and a novel graphical representation of information contained in inventory data (i.e. inventory information curve, IIC). This graphical representation illustrates the relative increase in available information with the growth of the training sample size. Experiments on a selected dataset over the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia were conducted to validate the proposed methods. The dataset contained 104 landslide inventories and 7 landslide-conditioning factors (i.e. altitude, slope, aspect, land use, distance from the stream, distance from the road and distance from lineament) derived from a LiDAR-based digital elevation model and thematic maps acquired from government authorities. In addition, three ML/statistical models, namely, k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT), were utilised to assess the proposed sampling strategy for LSM. The impacts of model's hyperparameters, noise and outliers on the performance of the models and the shape of IICs were also investigated and discussed. To evaluate the proposed method further, it was compared with other standard methods such as random sampling (RS), stratified RS (SRS) and cross-validation (CV). The evaluations were based on the area under the receiving characteristic curves. The results show that IICs are useful in explaining the information content in the training subset and their differences from the original inventory datasets. The quantitative evaluation with KNN, SVM and DT shows that the proposed method outperforms the RS and SRS in all the models and the CV method in KNN and DT models. The proposed sampling strategy enables new applications in landslide modelling, such as measuring inventory data content and complexity and selecting effective training samples to improve the predictive capability of landslide susceptibility models.

Deep learning methods can take advantage of the high-level representation and reconstruction of information from landslide-affecting factors. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based algorithm that combine classifiers of both deep learning and machine learning is proposed for landslide susceptibility assessment. A stacked autoencoder (StAE) and a sparse autoencoder (SpAE) both consist of an input layer for raw data, hidden layer for feature extraction, and output layer for classification and prediction. As a study case, Oda City and Gotsu City in Shimane Prefecture, southwestern Japan, were used for susceptibility assessment and prediction of landslides triggered by extreme rainfall. Results: The prediction performance was compared by analyzing real landslide and non-landslide data. The prediction performance of random forest (RF) was evaluated as better than that of a support vector machine (SVM) in traditional machine learning, so RF was combined with both StAE and SpAE. The results show that the prediction ratio of the combined classifiers was 93.2% for StAE combined with RF model and 92.5% for SpAE combined with RF model, which were higher than those of the SVM (87.4%), RF (89.7%), StAE (84.2%), and SpAE (88.2%). Conclusions: This study provides an example of combined classifiers giving a better predictive ratio than a single classifier. The asymmetric and unsupervised autoencoder combined with RF can exploit optimal non-linear features from landslide-affecting factors successfully, outperforms some conventional machine learning methods, and is promising for landslide susceptibility assessment.

However, for validation dataset, LMT and BN models generated similar AUC values (0.761 and 0.764 respectively), and the highest AUC value belonged to HT (0.802). The distributions of landslide susceptibility zones revealed that the interior of county town is mainly seated in low and very low susceptibility zones, whereas regions close to the border suffer high and very high landslide risk. The results acquired in this paper are significant to landslide prevention and urban planning in Muchuan, China. Additionally, this study proved that HT model is a promising classifier for landslide susceptibility modeling.

A total of 186 landslide locations were identified by earlier reports and field surveys. The landslide inventory was randomly divided into two parts: 70% for training dataset and 30% for validation dataset. Based on the multisource data and geological environment, 16 landslide conditioning factors were selected, including control factors and triggering factors (i.e., altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, SPI, TPI, TRI, lithology, distance to faults, TWI, distance to rivers, NDVI, distance to roads, land use, and rainfall). The susceptibility between each conditioning factor and landslide was deduced using a certainty factor model. Subsequently, combined with grid units and slope units, the landslide susceptibility models were carried out by using SVM and PSO-SVM methods. The precision capability of the landslide susceptibility mapping produced by different models and units was verified through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results showed that the PSO-SVM model based on slope units had the best performance in landslide susceptibility mapping, and the area under the curve (AUC) values of training and validation datasets are 0.945 and 0.9245, respectively.

The main idea of this paper is to propose novel integrative models for landslide susceptibility evaluation in a prone area of Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari Province in Iran. To do this, four metaheuristic techniques, namely chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA), crow search algorithm (CSA), satin bowerbird optimization (SBO), and water cycle algorithm (WCA) are used to supervise the training of an artificial neural network (ANN). A spatial database is created by 170 historical landslides and 14 most common conditioning factors. The models are optimized in terms of hyper-parameters and elite ones are then used to produce the susceptibility maps. During the training phase, all models could acquire a reliable understanding of the landslide pattern. The obtained accuracy index of area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC) showed that the maps produced by the WCA-ANN (AUROC = 0.925) and SBO-ANN (AUROC = 0.900) are more accurate than those of the ChOA-ANN (AUROC = 0.851) and CSA-ANN (AUROC = 0.855). Considering this assessment, the suggested hybrid models are reliable enough for landslide susceptibility modeling. Accordingly, the generated susceptibility map can be used for urban planning and generating alert systems over the studied area.

The most common hazards in this region are landslides and debris flows, which result in loss of life and severe infrastructure damage every year. This study assessed geohazards (landslides and debris flows) and developed susceptibility maps by considering four standalone machine-learning and statistical approaches, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Shannon Entropy (SE),Weights-of-Evidence (WoE), and Frequency Ratio (FR) models. To this end, geohazard inventories were prepared using remote sensing techniques with field observations and historical hazard datasets. The spatial relationship of thirteen conditioning factors, namely, slope (degree), distance to faults, geology, elevation, distance to rivers, slope aspect, distance to road, annual mean rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index, profile curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, and land cover, with hazard distribution was analyzed. The results showed that faults, slope angles, elevation, lithology, land cover, and mean annual rainfall play a key role in controlling the spatial distribution of geohazards in the study area. The final susceptibility maps were validated against ground truth points and by plotting Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves. According to the AUROC curves, the success rates of the LR, WoE, FR, and SE models were 85.30%, 76.00, 74.60%, and 71.40%, and their prediction rates were 83.10%, 75.00%, 73.50%, and 70.10%, respectively; these values show higher performance of LR over the other three models.

The landslide susceptibility for Ardanuc, Turkey was evaluated using three models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). Ten parameters that are effective in landslide occurrence are used in this study. The accuracy and prediction capabilities of the models were assessed using both the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) methods.

A traditional statistical certainty factor model (CF), a machine learning support vector machine model (SVM) and random forest model (RF), along with a hybrid CF-SVM model and a CF-RF model were applied to analyze landslide susceptibility. Firstly, 10 landslide conditioning factors were selected, namely slope-angle, altitude, slope aspect, degree of relief, lithology, distance to rivers, distance to faults, distance to roads, average annual rainfall and normalized difference vegetation index. The 23,169 slope units were generated from a Digital Elevation Model and the corresponding 10 conditioning factor layers were produced from both geological and geographical data. Then, landslide susceptibility mapping was carried out using the five models, respectively. Next, the landslide density (LD), frequency ratio (FR), the area under the curve (AUC) and other indicators were used to validate the rationality, performance and accuracy of the models. The results showed that the susceptibility maps produced from the different models were all reasonable. In each map, the LD and FR were greatest in the zones classed as having very high landslide susceptibility, followed by the high, moderate, low and very low landslide susceptibility classes, respectively. From the comparison of the different maps and ROC curves, the RF model based on slope units was the most appropriate for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area. It was also found that the combination of weaker learner model (CF model here) with a stronger learner model (SVM and RF model here) can impact the applicability of the stronger model.

Two well-known machine learning classifiers such as C4.5 decision tree (C4.5) and artificial neural network (ANN) were served as base-learners. A total of five ensemble models, including the Bag-C4.5 model, the Boost-C4.5 model, the Bag-ANN model, the Boost-ANN model, and the Stacking C4.5-ANN model, were constructed by using various ensemble techniques and base-learners. A landslide inventory map and 12 landslide-related factors have been prepared as the spatial database for landslide modeling. The importance of factors was verified using the information gain (IG) method. It turns out that the distance to roads has the greatest contribution to landslide susceptibility assessment. Subsequently, various landslide models were evaluated regarding the goodness of fit, generalization capability, and robustness. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), statistical analysis, and stability index (SI) were used as performance metrics. Evaluation results showed that ensemble learning techniques significantly refined individual landslide models such as the C4.5 (AUC = 0.832) and ANN (AUC = 0.870). In particular, Boosting-based models, e.g., the Boost-C4.5 model (AUC = 0.945) and the Boost-ANN model (AUC = 0.903), gained a higher performance than the Stacking C4.5-ANN model (AUC = 0.900), the Bag-ANN (AUC = 0.892), and the Bag-C4.5 (AUC = 0.878). Additionally, the best modeling robustness was achieved by the Stacking C4.5-ANN method (SI = 1). The results indicate that the Boosting technique has great confidence in strengthening the predictive accuracy for LSM. Also, the Stacking can provide a promising method for stable and improved landslide modeling. Findings from this study may assist to refine the quality of LSM and facilitate risk management for the study area or other similar regions.

Next, feature selection methods are used to obtain the importance of the conditioning factors to create feature subsets, based on which 13 FS-ML models are constructed. For each of the machine learning models, a best optimized FS-ML model is selected according to the area under curve value. Finally, five optimal FS-ML models are obtained and applied to the LSA of the studied area. The predictive abilities of the FS-ML models on LSA are verified and compared through the receive operating characteristic curve and statistical indicators such as sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The results showed that different feature selection methods have different effects on the performance of LSA machine learning models. FS-ML models generally outperform the ordinary machine learning models. The best FS-ML model is the recursive feature elimination (RFE) optimized RF, and RFE is an optimal method for feature selection.

Therefore, preparation of dataset, construction of predictive model and analysis of results are considered to be important stages for effective and efficient disaster management in LSM. In recent years, a large number of studies has mainly focused on the effects of using machine learning (ML) algorithms as a predictive model in LSM. Decision tree-based ensemble learning algorithms known as decision forest is one of the popular ML techniques based on a combination of several decision tree algorithms to construct an optimal prediction model. In this study, prediction performances of recently proposed decision tree-based ensemble-based algorithms namely canonical correlation forest (CCF) and rotation forest (RotFor) are tested on LSM. In order to compare their performances, popular ensemble learning algorithms including random forest (RF), AdaBoost and bagging algorithms are also considered. For this purpose, first, twelve conditioning factors are determined in the study area, Karabuk province of Turkey. Second, individual importance of the factors on LSM process is evaluated using Fischer score analysis and selected factors are used as an input dataset for the construction of landslide susceptibility prediction models of CCF, RotFor, RF, AdaBoost and bagging algorithms. For the assessment of the performances, overall accuracy (OA), success rate curves and the area under the curve (AUC) analysis are utilized. Furthermore, chi-squared-based McNemarâs test and well-known accuracy measures known as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are employed to evaluate the pairwise comparison of the ensemble learning methods. Results show that CCF method outperforms the RotFor method by about 4%, and there is no statistically significant difference between CFF and other methods.

Due to the extremely hazardous geological environment around the highway, landslides, debris flows, collapses, and subsidence are frequent. Among them, debris flows are one of the most serious geological hazards on the Karakoram Highway, and they often cause interruptions to traffic and casualties. Therefore, the development of debris flow susceptibility mapping along the highway can potentially facilitate its safe operation. In this study, we used remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning techniques to map debris flow susceptibility along the Karakoram Highway in areas where observation data are scarce and difficult to obtain by field survey. First, the distribution of 544 catchments which are prone to debris flow were identified through visual interpretation of remote sensing images. The factors influencing debris flow susceptibility were then analyzed, and a total of 17 parameters related to geomorphology, soil materials, and triggering conditions were selected. Model training was based on multiple common machine learning methods, including Ensemble Methods, Gaussian Processes, Generalized Linear models, Navies Bayes, Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Trees, Discriminant Analysis, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Support Vector Classification (SVC) was chosen as the final model after evaluation; its accuracy (ACC) was 0.91, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.96. Among the factors involved in SVC, the Melton Ratio (MR) was the most important, followed by drainage density (DD), Hypsometric Integral (HI), and average slope (AS), indicating that geomorphic conditions play an important role in predicting debris flow susceptibility in the study area. SVC was used to map debris flow susceptibility in the study area, and the results will potentially facilitate the safe operation of the highway.

In the last decade, statistical methods have gradually exerted their impact on mapping the landslide susceptibility to locate the high-risk places of landslide. However, due to the complexity of getting full access to the thematic information in large scenarios, most of these statistical methods generally suffer from overfitting, inadequate representative power, and the inability to transfer the learned representation to other places. To solve these challenges, this study designed an unsupervised representation learning module, which features independence, compactness, robustness, and transferability. Specifically, we first stack restricted Boltzmann machines and denoising autoencoder to unsupervised discover the underlying representations embedded in the thematic maps. Then, we applied the transferring strategy in an adversarial manner to generalize the learned representations to the sample-scarce area. Experimental results and analyses using data in different regions have revealed that the proposed method can be generalized well between different LSM scenarios. In terms of precision, it outperforms other methods by a large margin, e.g., by around 7% compared to multilayer perceptrons with the same configuration, and by 3%-4% to the state of art algorithm random forest. Besides, compared to other methods, the landslide susceptibility map that is predicted by the proposed method featuring smoothness and stableness seems more reliable, and is more according to some prior knowledge that, for example, distance to the drainage, slope, and stratum, should exert dominant effects on the occurrence of a landslide.

Nevertheless, landslide hazard evaluation has a key role in the implementation of risk mitigation policies and an effort should be done to retrieve information and make it useful for this purpose. In this research, we go through this topic of optimising the information available in catalogues, starting from landslide inventory review and constitution of a boosted training dataset, propaedeutic for susceptibility analysis based on machine learning methods. The temporal recurrence of landslide events has been approached here either through the definitions of large-scale quantitative hazard descriptors or by analysis of historical rainfall (i.e., the main triggering factor for the considered shallow earth slope failures) databases through the definition of rainfall probability curves. Spatial and temporal attributes were integrated, selecting potential landslide source areas ranked in terms of hazard. Data integration was also pursued through persistent scatterer interferometry analysis which pointed out areas of interest within potential landslide source areas featured by ongoing ground movement.

The ignorance of this issue will result in some biases and time-invariance in landslide susceptibility. Hence, a novel framework has been proposed to update landslide susceptibility by simultaneously considering the spatial and temporal effects of landslides at the regional scale. In this framework, the landslide inventory of Chongyi County has been divided into pre- and fresh-landslide inventories. According to the LSP results predicted by the support vector machine (SVM) model using the slope unit-based conditioning factors and pre-landslide inventory, a normalized spatial distance index (NSDI) is calculated to quantitatively represent the spatial correlation between landslides and surrounding slope units to develop the SVM-NSDI model. Furthermore, the SVM-Updating model, which incorporates the LSP results of the SVM-NSDI model and fresh-landslide inventory, could be developed to update the LSP results. Subsequently, the confusion matrix, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and frequency ratio (FR) accuracy are used to evaluate the prediction performance of the above LSP models. The F1-score values of the SVM, SVM-NSDI and SVM-Updating models are 0.776, 0.816 and 0.831, respectively. The AUC values are 0.869, 0.903 and 0.914 and the FR accuracies are 0.795, 0.853 and 0.873. It can be concluded that landslide susceptibility is a time-variant variable, which can be updated by considering the spatial correlation between landslides and surrounding slope units as well as the temporal effects of multi-temporal landslide inventory.

Deep-learning-based change detection greatly aids landslide mapping by identifying the down-slope movement of soil, rock and other materials from bitemporal images, benefiting from the feature representation capabilities of convolutional neural networks. However, these networks rely on large amounts of pixel-level annotated data to achieve their promising performance and they normally exhibit weak generalization capability on heterogeneous image data from unseen domains. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-guided domain-aware progressive representation learning (PG-DPRL) method for cross-domain landslide mapping from large-scale remote sensing images based on the multitarget domain adaptation (MTDA) technique. PG-DPRL attempts to learn a shared landslide mapping network that performs well in multiple target domains with no additional effort for sample annotation. Specifically, PG-DPRL adopts a near-to-far adaptation strategy to gradually align the representation distributions of all target domains with the source domain, considering discrepancies between them. On this basis, cross-domain prototype learning is exploited to generate reliable domain-specific pseudo-labels and aggregate representations across domains to learn a shared decision boundary. In each DPRL step, the prototype-guided adversarial learning (PGAL) algorithm is performed to achieve category-wise representation alignment and improve the discriminative capability of representations by introducing the Wasserstein distance metric and cross-domain prototype consistency (CPC) loss. Experiments on a global very-high-resolution landslide mapping (GVLM) dataset consisting of 17 heterogeneous domains from different landslide sites demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PG-DPRL. It considerably improves the transferability of landslide mapping networks and outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of total and average accuracy metrics among all target domains. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Firstly, multiple MLMs were selected and hyperparameters were optimized, and the generated 11 models were cross-integrated to select the best model to calculate landslide susceptibility; by calculating precipitation for different extreme precipitation recurrence periods and combining the susceptibility results to assess the landslide hazard. Using the town as the basic unit, the exposure and vulnerability of the future landslide population under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios in each town were assessed, and then combined with the hazard to estimate the LPAR in 2050. The results showed that the integrated model with the optimized random forest model as the combination strategy had the best comprehensive performance in susceptibility assessment. The distribution of hazard classes is similar to susceptibility, and with an increase in precipitation, the low-hazard area and high-hazard decrease and shift to medium-hazard and very high-hazard classes. The high-risk areas for future landslide populations in Shuicheng County are mainly concentrated in the three southwestern towns with high vulnerability, whereas the northern towns of Baohua and Qinglin are at the lowest risk class. The LPAR increased with the intensity of extreme precipitation. The LPAR differs significantly among the SSPs scenarios, with the lowest in the “fossil-fueled development (SSP5)” scenario and the highest in the “regional rivalry (SSP3)” scenario. In summary, the landslide susceptibility model based on integrated machine learning proposed in this study has a high predictive capability.

On August 8, 2017, a strong Ms 7.0 earthquake occurred in this region, causing some of the mountains in the area to become loose and cracked. Therefore, a survey and evaluation of landslides in this area can help to reveal hazards and take effective measures for subsequent disaster management. However, different evaluation models can yield different spatial distributions of landslide susceptibility, and thus, selecting the appropriate model and performing the optimal combination of parameters is the most effective way to improve susceptibility evaluation. In order to construct an evaluation indicator system suitable for Jiuzhaigou County, we extracted 12 factors affecting the occurrence of landslides, including slope, elevation and slope surface, and made samples. At the core of the transformer model is a self-attentive mechanism that enables any two of the features to be interlinked, after which feature extraction is performed via a forward propagation network (FFN). We exploited its coding structure to transform it into a deep learning model that is more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation. The results show that the transformer model has the highest accuracy (86.89%), followed by the random forest and support vector machine models (84.47% and 82.52%, respectively), and the logistic regression model achieves the lowest accuracy (79.61%).

In this study, a novel method is presented that improves the performance of the LS models using the TrAdaBoost transfer learning algorithm. The proposed method transfers useful knowledge from one landslide inventory to another to improve the performance of LS models through which the effort to recollect landslide data is reduced. A database involving 373 historical landslide locations and 5 landslide influencing factors (LIFs, the slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, lithology, and curvature) in the study area (Zigui Basin, China) and 4,120 historical landslide locations and the corresponding LIFs in the source area (Wenchuan-Yingxiu area, China) were used for demonstration. The frequency ratio method was used to tackle problems of feature dissimilarities of LIFs between the study area and the source area. And then, with these quantified influencing factors as inputs, the three TrAdaBoost models (with decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) as basic learners, namely TrAdaBoost-DT, TrAdaBoost-SVM, and TrAdaBoost-RF, respectively), and three conventional machine learning models (DT, SVM, RF) were adopted for showing the performance of the TrAdaBoost in improving the LS models.

The accuracy of the landslide susceptibility prediction model based on machine learning is significantly higher than that of traditional expert knowledge and the conventional mathematical statistics model. The correct and reasonable selection of non-landslide samples in the machine learning model greatly improves the prediction accuracy and reliability of the regional landslide susceptibility model. Focusing on the problem of selecting non-landslide samples in the machine learning model for landslide susceptibility evaluation, this paper proposes a landslide susceptibility evaluation method based on the combination of an information model and machine learning in traditional mathematical statistics. First, the influence factors for landslide susceptibility evaluation are screened by the correlation analysis method. Second, the information value model is used to delimit areas with low and relatively low landslide susceptibility, and non-landslide points are randomly selected. Third, a landslide susceptibility evaluation method combined with IV-ML, such as logistic regression (IV-LR), random forest (IV-RF), support vector machine (IV-SVM), and artificial neural network (IV-ANN), is established. Finally, the landslide susceptibility factors in the Dabie Mountain area of Anhui Province are analyzed, and the accuracy of the landslide susceptibility evaluation results using the IV-LR, IV-RF, IV-SVM, and IV-ANN and LR, RF, SVM, and ANN methods are compared. The accuracy is evaluated by examining the ACC, AUC, and kappa values of the model.

The aim of this study is to propose a robust discretization criterion (RDC) to quantify and explore the uncertainty and subjectivity of different discretization methods. The RDC consists of two steps: raw classification dataset generation and optimal dataset extraction. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed RDC method, Lushan County of Sichuan Province in China was chosen as the study area to generate the LSM based on three datasets (optimal dataset, original dataset with continuous values, and statistical dataset) using three popular ML methods, namely, convolution neural network, random forest, and logistic regression. The results show that the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of the optimal dataset for the abovementioned ML models are 0.963, 0.961, and 0.930 which are higher than those of the original dataset (0.938, 0.947, and 0.900) and statistical dataset (0.948, 0.954, and 0.897).

Taking Yanchang County of China as example, the landslide inventory and 12 important conditioning factors were acquired. The frequency ratios of each conditioning factor were calculated under five spatial resolutions (15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 ​m). Landslide and non-landslide samples obtained under each spatial resolution were further divided into five proportions of training and testing datasets (9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4 and 5:5), and four typical machine learning models were applied for LSP modelling. The results demonstrated that different spatial resolution and training and testing dataset proportions induce basically similar influences on the modeling uncertainty. With a decrease in the spatial resolution from 15 ​m to 120 ​m and a change in the proportions of the training and testing datasets from 9:1 to 5:5, the modelling accuracy gradually decreased, while the mean values of predicted landslide susceptibility indexes increased and their standard deviations decreased.

Rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is crucial for disaster prevention and disaster losses mitigation, though most studies are temporally ambiguous and on a regional scale. To better reveal landslide mechanisms and provide more accurate landslide susceptibility maps for landslide risk assessment and hazard prediction, developing a global dynamic LSM model is essential. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) as the main data platform and applied three tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithms to construct global, dynamic rainfall-induced LSM models based on dynamic and static landslide influencing factors. The dynamic perspective is used in LSM: dynamic changes in landslide susceptibility can be identified on a daily scale. We note that Random Forest algorithm offers robust performance for accurate LSM (AUC = 0.975) and although the classification accuracy of LightGBM is the highest (AUC = 0.977), the results do not meet the sufficient conditions of a landslide susceptibility map.

The main constraint of susceptibility maps is that they are not adequate for temporal assessments: they are generated from static predisposing factors, allowing only a spatial prediction of landslides. Recently, some methodologies have been proposed to provide spatiotemporal landslides prediction starting from machine learning algorithms (e.g., combining susceptibility maps with rainfall thresholds), but the attempt to obtain a dynamic landslide probability map directly by applying machine learning models is still in the preliminary phase. This work provides a contribution to fix this gap, combining in a Random Forest (RF) algorithm a static indicator of the spatial probability of landslide occurrence (i.e., a classical susceptibility index) and a number of dynamic variables (i.e., seasonality and the rainfall amount cumulated over different reference periods). The RF implementation used in this work allows the calculation of the Out-of-Bag Error and depicts Partial Dependence Plots, two indices that were used to quantify the variables’ importance and to comprehend if the model outcomes are consistent with the triggering mechanism observed in the case of study (Metropolitan City of Florence, Italy). The goal of this research is not to set up a landslide probability map, but to 1) understand how to populate training and test datasets with observations sampled over space and time, 2) assess which rainfall variables are statistically more relevant for the identification of the time and location of landslides, and 3) test the dynamic application of RF in a forecasting model for the spatiotemporal prediction of landslides. The proposed dynamic methodology shows encouraging results, consistent with the actual knowledge of the physical mechanism of the triggering of shallow landslides (mainly influenced by short and intense rainfalls) and identifies some benchmark configurations that represents a promising starting point for future regional-scale applications of machine learning models to dynamic landslide probability assessment and early warning.

A geospatial database was established in GIS based on various factors of topography, geological conditions, environmental conditions and human activities, including 22 conditioning factors and 866 historical landslides. As for model algorithms, ANN is an operation model composed of a large number of interconnected nodes, and RF refers to an ensemble method of separately trained binary decision trees. Two algorithms were adopted in this paper for landslide susceptibility models. Meantime, an interpretable algorithm SHAP was used to gain insight into essential decision mechanism of LSMs. The result showed that RF model exhibits better stability and robustness. The global interpretation shows that the same landslide moderators play different roles in different models. The local interpretation shows that for the same evaluation unit different models give different decision mechanisms, and the local interpretation can be combined with the field survey, which can provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the assigned landslide. © 2022 The Author(s).

Remote sensing images can be used to effectively monitor landslides at a large scale, which is of great significance for pre-disaster warning and post-disaster assistance. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have made great progress in the field of remote sensing image landslide detection. In remote sensing images, landslides display a variety of scales and shapes. In this article, to better extract and keep the multiscale shape information of landslides, a shape-enhanced vision transformer (ShapeFormer) model is proposed. For the feature extraction, a pyramid vision transformer (PVT) model is introduced, which directly models the global information of local elements at different scales. To learn the shape information of different landslides, a shape feature extraction branch is designed, which uses the adjacent feature maps at different scales in the PVT model to improve the boundary information. After the feature extraction step, a decoder with deconvolutional layers follows, which combines the multiple features and gradually recovers the original resolution of the combined features. A softmax layer is connected with the combined features to acquire the final pixel-wise result. The proposed ShapeFormer model was tested on two public datasets-the Bijie dataset and the Nepal dataset-which have different spectral and spatial characteristics. The results, when compared with those of some of the state-of-the-art methods, show the potential of the proposed method for use with multisource optical remote sensing data for landslide detection.",IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING,10.1109/jstars.2023.3253769,5,5,No,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, detailed inventories are crucial for the succeeding phases of landslide risk studies like susceptibility and hazard assessment. The openly available inventories differ in the quality and completeness levels. Event-based landslide inventories are created based on manual interpretation, and there can be significant differences in the mapping preferences among interpreters. To address this issue, we used two different datasets to analyze the potential of U-Net and machine learning approaches for automated landslide detection in the Himalayas. Dataset-1 is composed of five optical bands from the RapidEye satellite imagery. Dataset-2 is composed of the RapidEye optical data, and ALOS-PALSAR derived topographical data. We used a small dataset consisting of 239 samples acquired from several training zones and one testing zone to evaluate our modelsâ performance using the fully convolutional U-Net model, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor, and the Random Forest (RF). We created thirty-two different maps to evaluate and understand the implications of different sample patch sizes and their effect on the accuracy of landslide detection in the study area. The results were then compared against the manually interpreted inventory compiled using fieldwork and visual interpretation of the RapidEye satellite image. We used accuracy assessment metrics such as F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). In the context of the Nepali Himalayas, employing RapidEye images and machine learning models, a viable patch size was investigated. The U-Net model trained with 128 Ã 128 pixel patch size yields the best MCC results (76.59%) with the dataset-1. The added information from the digital elevation model benefited the overall detection of landslides. However, it does not improve the modelâs overall accuracy but helps differentiate human settlement areas and river sand bars. In this study, the U-Net achieved slightly better results than other machine learning approaches. Although it can depend on architecture of the U-Net model and the complexity of the geographical features in the imagery, the U-Net model is still preliminary in the domain of landslide detection. There is very little literature available related to the use of U-Net for landslide detection. This study is one of the first efforts of using U-Net for landslide detection in the Himalayas. Nevertheless, U-Net has the potential to improve further automated landslide detection in the future for varied topographical and geomorphological scenes.

In densely populated urban areas, this type of heavy rain can cause extreme landslide damage, so that it is necessary to estimate and analyze the susceptibility of future landslides. In this regard, deep learning (DL) methodologies have been used to identify areas prone to landslides recently. Therefore, in this study, DL methodologies, including a deep neural network (DNN), kernel-based DNN, and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to identify areas where landslides could occur. As a detailed step for this purpose, landslide occurrence was first determined as landslide inventory through aerial photographs with comparative analysis using field survey data; a training set was built for model training through oversampling based on the landslide inventory. A total of 17 landslide influencing variables that influence the frequency of landslides by topography and geomorphology, as well as soil and forest variables, were selected to establish a landslide inventory. Then models were built using DNN, kernel-based DNN, and CNN models, and the susceptibility of landslides in the study area was determined. Model performance was evaluated through the average precision (AP) score and root mean square error (RMSE) for each of the three models. Finally, DNN, kernel-based DNN, and CNN models showed performances of 99.45%, 99.44%, and 99.41%, and RMSE values of 0.1694, 0.1806, and 0.1747, respectively. As a result, all three models showed similar performance, indicating excellent predictive ability of the models developed in this study. The information of landslides occurring in urban areas, which cause a great damage even with a small number of occurrences, can provide a basis for reference to the government and local authorities for urban landslide management.

Many landslide casual factors are often generated from DEMs. Most studies on landslide susceptibility assessments rely on freely available DEMs. However, very little is known about the performance of different DEMs with varying spatial resolutions on the accurate assessment of landslide susceptibility. This study compared the performance of four different DEMs including 30 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), 30-90 m Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 12.5 m Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array Type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and 25 m Survey of Bangladesh (SOB) DEM in landslide susceptibility assessment in the Rangamati district in Bangladesh. This study used three different landslide susceptibility assessment techniques: modified frequency ratio (bivariate model), logistic regression (multivariate model), and random forest (machine-learning model). This study explored two scenarios of landslide susceptibility assessment: using only DEM-derived causal factors and using both DEM-derived factors as well as other common factors. The success and prediction rate curves indicate that the SRTM DEM provides the highest accuracies for the bivariate model in both scenarios. Results also reveal that the ALOS PALSAR DEM shows the best performance in landslide susceptibility mapping using the logistics regression and the random forest models. A relatively finer resolution DEM, the SOB DEM, shows the lowest accuracies compared to other DEMs for all models and scenarios. It can also be noted that the performance of all DEMs except the SOB DEM is close (72%-84%) considering the success and prediction accuracies. Therefore, anyone of the three global DEMs: ASTER, SRTM, and ALOS PALSAR can be used for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area.

Sikkim Himalayan region is also suffering from landslide problem. This study's main objective was to generate landslide susceptibility map (LSM) considering the hybrid ensemble of machine learning approaches using different sample ratios. Random Forest (RF) as the base classifier an ensemble with bagging, Rotation Forest (RTF), and Random Subspace (RS) Meta classifiers were used for spatial landslide modeling. First, collected 86 landslides locations through field investigation and from Sikkim district disaster office were mapped as a landslide inventory. Collected landslide locations were categorized into training and testing datasets randomly using four sample ratios (50:50, 60:40, 70:30 and 80:20). Based on the four sampling ratios and fifteen conditioning factors, a total of sixteen LSMs were prepared using RF, Bagging-RF (B-RF), RTF-RF and RS-RF in GIS platform. For assessing the modeling accuracy and comparison among these, the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) and other statistical methods such as root-mean-square-error (RMSE), mean-absolute-error (MAE) and R-index methods were used. The overall proficiency of RS-RF (AUC = 0.871, 0.847 of 50%:50%, AUC = 0.925, 0.931 of 60%:40%, AUC = 0.933, 0.939 of 70%:30%; AUC = 0.927, 0.933 of 80%:20%) was found to be substantially greater than the results of RF, B-RF, and RTF-RF. The RS-RF model and 70:30 sample ratio had the highest goodness-of-fit and accuracy as per the RMSE, MAE, and R-index methods. Furthermore, the model based on RS-RF is a promising and acceptable way of mapping regional landslides.

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is considered as the key for the prevention of hazard. The primary goal of the present study is to assess and compare four models: classification and regression tree, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), adaptive boosting-decision tree and random forest for the performance of landslide susceptibility modeling. Firstly, a landslide inventory map consisting of 229 historical shallow landslide locations was prepared and the same number of non-landslide points was determined by k-means clustering. Secondly, 12 conditioning factors were considered in the landslide susceptibility modeling. The prediction performance of the four models were estimated by fivefold cross validation and relative operating characteristic curve (ROC), area under the ROC curve (AUC) and statistical measures. The results showed that the GBDT performed best in the training and validation dataset, with the highest prediction capability (AUC = 0.986 and 0.940), highest accuracy value (95.3% and 88.1%) and highest kappa index (0.904 and 0.772), respectively. Therefore, the GBDT was considered to be the most suitable model and applied to the whole study area for LSM. The results of this study also demonstrate that the performance can be enhanced with the use of ensemble learning. The sampling strategy of non-landslide points can be improved by combining with clustering analysis which are more reasonable.

Thus, the intersection of landslide and wildfire susceptibility and the spatial uncertainty of the susceptibility maps were studied in this paper. Reliable landslide and wildfire susceptibility maps are necessary for disaster management and land use planning. This work used three advanced ensemble machine learning algorithms: RF (Random Forest), GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) and AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) to assess the landslide and wildfire susceptibility for SEA. A geo-database was established with 2759 landslide locations, 1633 wildfire locations and 18 predictor variables in total. The perfor-mances of the models were assessed using the overall classification accuracy (ACC), Precision, the area under the ROC (receiver operating curve) (AUC) and confusion matrix values. The results showed RF performs superior in both landslide (ACC = 0.81, Precision = 0.78 and AUC= 0.89) and wildfire (ACC= 0.83, Precision = 0.83 and AUC = 0.91) susceptibility modeling, followed by GBDT and AdaBoost. The overall superiority of RF over other models indicates that it is potentially an efficient model for landslide and wildfire susceptibility mapping. The landslide and wildfire susceptibility were obtained using the RF model. This paper also conducted an overlay analysis of the two hazards. The uncertainty of the susceptibility was further assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV). Additionally, the distance to roads is relatively important in both landslide and wildfire susceptibility, which is the most important in landslides and the second most important in wildfires. The result of this paper is useful for mastering the whole situation of hazard susceptibility and proves that RF is a robust model in the hazard susceptibility assessment in SEA.

Existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods apply self-built CNN with simple structure, which failed to reach CNN's full potential on high-level feature extraction, meanwhile ignored the use of numerical predisposing factors. For the purpose of exploring feature fusion based CNN models with greater reliability in LSM, this study proposes an ensemble model based on channel-expanded pre-trained CNN and traditional machine learning model (CPCNN-ML). In CPCNN-ML, pre-trained CNN with mature structure is modified to excavate high-level features of multichannel predisposing factor layers. LSM result is generated by traditional machine learning (ML) model based on hybrid feature of high-level features and numerical predisposing factors. Lantau Island, Hong Kong is selected as study area; temporal landslide inventory is used for model training and evaluation. Experimental results show that CPCNN-ML has ability to predict landslide occurrence with high reliability, especially the CPCNN-ML based on random forest. Contrast experiments with self-built CNN and traditional ML models further embody the superiority of CPCNN-ML. It is worth noting that coastal regions are newly identified landslide-prone regions compared with previous research. This finding is of great reference value for Hong Kong authorities to formulate appropriate disaster prevention and mitigation policies.

The present study aims at exploring the way to integrating different models and comparing the results among integrated and individual models. Our objective is to answer this question: Will the integrated model have higher accuracy compared with individual model? The Lvliang mountains area, a landslide-prone area in China, was taken as the study area, and ten factors were considered in the influencing factors system. Three basic machine learning models (the back propagation (BP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) models) were integrated by an objective function where the weight coefficients among different models were computed by the gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. 80 and 20% of the landslide data were randomly selected as the training and testing samples, respectively, and different landslide susceptibility maps were generated based on the GIS platform. The results illustrated that the accuracy expressed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the BP-SVM-RF integrated model was the highest (0.7898), which was better than that of the BP (0.6929), SVM (0.6582), RF (0.7258), BP-SVM (0.7360), BP-RF (0.7569), and SVM-RF models (0.7298). The experimental results authenticated the effectiveness of the BP-SVM-RF method, which can be a reliable model for the regional landslide susceptibility assessment of the study area.

Taking Wuqi County in the hinterland of the Loess Plateau as the research area, using Bayesian hyperparameters to optimize random forest and extreme gradient boosting decision trees model for landslide susceptibility mapping, and the two optimized models are compared. In addition, 14 landslide influencing factors are selected, and 734 landslides are obtained according to field investigation and reports from literals. The landslides were randomly divided into training data (70%) and validation data (30%). The hyperparameters of the random forest and extreme gradient boosting decision tree models were optimized using a Bayesian algorithm, and then the optimal hyperparameters are selected for landslide susceptibility mapping. Both models were evaluated and compared using the receiver operating characteristic curve and confusion matrix. The results show that the AUC validation data of the Bayesian optimized random forest and extreme gradient boosting decision tree model are 0.88 and 0.86, respectively, which showed an improvement of 4 and 3%, indicating that the prediction performance of the two models has been improved. However, the random forest model has a higher predictive ability than the extreme gradient boosting decision tree model. Thus, hyperparameter optimization is of great significance in the improvement of the prediction accuracy of the model.

The proposed model consists of two parts; one is the extraction of landslide spatial information using two-dimensional CNN and pixel windows, and the other is to capture the correlated features among the conditioning factors using one-dimensional convolutional operations. To evaluate the validity of the proposed model, two pure CNN models and the previously used methods of random forest and a support vector machine were selected as the benchmark models. A total of 621 earthquake-triggered landslides in Ludian County, China and 14 conditioning factors derived from the topography, geological, hydrological, geophysical, land use and land cover data were used to generate a geospatial dataset. The conditioning factors were then selected and analyzed by a multicollinearity analysis and the frequency ratio method. Finally, the trained model calculated the landslide probability of each pixel in the study area and produced the resultant susceptibility map. The results indicated that the hybrid model benefitted from the features extraction capability of the CNN and achieved high-performance results in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and statistical indices. Moreover, the proposed model had 6.2% and 3.7% more improvement than the two pure CNN models in terms of the AUC, respectively. Therefore, the proposed model is capable of accurately mapping landslide susceptibility and providing a promising method for hazard mitigation and land use planning. Additionally, it is recommended to be applied to other areas of the world. Â© 2021 by the authors.

However, landslide risk depends on the poorly known environmental and socio-economic factors for regional patterns of landslide occurrence probability and vulnerability, which constitute still a matter of research. Here, a hybrid model is described that couples data mining and multi-criteria decision-making methods for hazard and vulnerability mapping and presents its application to landslide risk assessment in Golestan Province, Northeastern Iran. To this end, landslide probability is mapped using three state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithmsâMaximum Entropy, Support Vector Machine and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Productionâand combine the results with Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process computations of vulnerability to obtain the landslide risk map. Based on obtained results, a discussion is presented on landslide probability as a function of the main relevant human-environmental conditioning factors in Golestan Province. In particular, from the response curves of the machine learning algorithms, it can be found that the probability p of landslide occurrence decreases nearly exponentially with the distance x to the next road, fault, or river. Specifically, the results indicated that p? exp (- ?x) where the length scale ? is about 0.0797 km?1 for road, 0.108 km?1 for fault, and 0.734 km?1 0.734Â km?1 for river. Furthermore, according to the results, p follows, approximately, a lognormal function of elevation, while the equation p=p0-K(?-?0)2 fits well the dependence of landslide modeling on the slope-angle ?, with p0?0.64,?0?25.6?and|K|?6.6Ã10-4. However, the highest predicted landslide risk levels in Golestan Province are located in the south and southwest areas surrounding Gorgan City, owing to the combined effect of dense local human occupation and strongly landslide-prone environmental conditions. Obtained results provide insights for quantitative modeling of landslide risk, as well as for priority planning in landslide risk management.

The models were compared using area under the curve (AUC) values in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The validation results showed that optimized models based on CNN-GWO (AUC = 0.876, RMSE = 0.08) and CNN-ICA (AUC = 0.852, RMSE = 0.09) outperformed the standalone CNN model (AUC = 0.847, RMSE = 0.12). Nevertheless, the CNN model outperformed previous research that used a machine learning algorithm alone.

The potential of deep learning (DL) like convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on landslide causative factors has not been fully explored yet. The main target of this study is the investigation of a GIS-based LSM in Zanjan, Iran and to explore the most important causative factor of landslides in the case study area. Different machine learning (ML) methods have been employed and compared to select the best results in the case study area. The CNN is compared with four ML algorithms, including random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). To do so, sixteen landslide causative factors have been extracted and their related spatial layers have been prepared. Then, the algorithms were trained with related landslide and non-landslide points. The results illustrate that the five ML algorithms performed suitably (precision = 82.43â85.6%, AUC = 0.934â0.967). The RF algorithm achieves the best result, while the CNN, SVM, the ANN, and the LR have the best results after RF, respectively, in this case study. Moreover, variable importance analysis results indicate that slope and topographic curvature contribute more to the prediction. The results would be beneficial to planning strategies for landslide risk management. Â© 2022 by the authors.

However, the manual labelling of instances for training machine learning models is time?consuming given the data requirements of flexible data?driven algorithms and the small percentage of area covered by landslides. Active learning aims to reduce labelling costs by selecting more informative instances. In this study, two common active?learning strategies, uncertainty sampling and query by committee, are combined with the support vector machine (SVM), a state?of?the?art machine?learning technique, in a landslide mapping case study in order to assess their possible benefits compared to simple random sampling of training locations. By selecting more âinformativeâ instances, the SVMs with active learning based on uncertainty sampling outperformed both random sampling and query?by?committee strategies when considering mean AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) as performance measure. Uncertainty sampling also produced more stable performances with a smaller AUROC standard deviation across repetitions. In conclusion, under limited data conditions, uncertainty sampling reduces the amount of expert time needed by selecting more informative instances for SVM training. We therefore recommend incorporating active learning with uncertainty sampling into interactive landslide modelling workflows, especially in emergency response settings, but also in landslide susceptibility modelling.

Remote-sensing offers the unique possibility for continuous measurements of this variable. Especially for agriculture, there is a strong demand for high spatial resolution mapping. However, operationally available soil moisture products exist with medium to coarse spatial resolution only (?1 km). This study introduces a machine learning (ML)âbased approach for the high spatial resolution (50 m) mapping of soil moisture based on the integration of Landsat-8 optical and thermal images, Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR images, and modelled data, executable in the Google Earth Engine. The novelty of this approach lies in applying an entirely data-driven ML concept for global estimation of the surface soil moisture content. Globally distributed in situ data from the International Soil Moisture Network acted as an input for model training. Based on the independent validation dataset, the resulting overall estimation accuracy, in terms of Root-Mean-Squared-Error and R2, was 0.04 m3Â·m?3 and 0.81, respectively. Beyond the retrieval model itself, this article introduces a framework for collecting training data and a stand-alone Python package for soil moisture mapping. The Google Earth Engine Python API facilitates the execution of data collection and retrieval which is entirely cloud-based.

We applied a generalized feature selection algorithm and a random forest susceptibility model to demonstrate the major topographic controls of landslides and the risk associated with them in the WG region. Our results show that road cutting and slopes modified to plantations are the strongest environmental variable (50% - 73% within 300 m buffer distance) related to the landslide patterns, whereas short-duration intense precipitation in the high elevated terrain, profile concavity, and stream power contributed to the initiation of landslides.

In difficult terrains such as those prevalent in the North-Eastern regions of India, coupled with the factors such as population explosion and improper land use, lead them to witness some of the worldâs most drastic landslides with an astonishing frequency, reckoning landslide susceptibility assessment crucial in such regions. This paper focuses on exploring a promising machine learning ensemble technique of Majority-based voting which has seldom been employed for landslide susceptibility assessment. The ensemble comprises Logistic Regression (LR), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) and Voting Feature Interval (VFI) to prepare landslide susceptibility zonation maps for the Brahmaputra valley region (Assam & Nagaland) and its close vicinity. In the first stage of the study, a landslide inventory for the area comprising 436 landslide locations was prepared in geographic information system (GIS), substantiated by news reports and remote sensing data. In the second stage, 16 landslide causative thematic maps including Elevation, Slope, Slope Aspect, General Curvature, Plan Curvature, Profile Curvature, Surface Roughness, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), Slope Length, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), Distance from Roads, Rivers, Faults and Railways were prepared. In the third stage, the landslide inventory was annexed with the causative factor maps to obtain a dataset comprising coordinates of the locations and the values of aforementioned causative factors on the corresponding coordinates. The proposed model was then trained and tested on the prepared dataset (70%:30% split). Finally, the efficiency of the new model was tested using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC).

Unlike traditional methods for drawing LIM, the proposed DP-FCN directly draws LIMs from the bitemporal aerial images with VHR through a trained deep neural network without generating the change magnitude map. Thus, the proposed approach can effectively reduce the effects of pseudo changes caused by phenological differences rather than landslide events. The proposed DP-FCN model contains two modules, namely, deep feature extraction, and joint feature learning networks. Deep feature extraction aims to reduce redundancy while extracting the high-level deep features from bitemporal images. Joint feature learning establishes the relationship between the deep features of bitemporal images and the ground reference map. Experiments on the real datasets of the landslide sites in Lantau Island of Hong Kong, China, demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach in drawing LIM with VHR remote sensing images.

This study analyzes the risk, vulnerability, and resilience of several landslide-prone areas in eight countries based on community perception and attitude related to landslide events through an online survey questionnaire that includes four sections: (1) natural disaster and landslide susceptibility, (2) knowledge and awareness of the causes of landslides, (3) psychological effects of landslide events, and (4) sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics. To gain an in-depth understanding of the landslide risk and sustainability, three state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) approaches, Decision Tree (DT), Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Random Forest (RF), and a statistical approach, Logistic Regression (LR), were used to investigate and compare the performance of the ML models. The results suggested that indirect losses caused by landslides significantly affect the communities across the globe both psychologically and economically. Furthermore, heavy rain is the most relevant event that was perceived by the communities to trigger a potential landslide, while major civil infrastructure systems, including building and road damages, were found as the main threats to the community due to landslides. The most significant factors related to landslide risk based on the Gini coefficient were found to be land classification, environmental factors, and building material. In addition, based on LR, land classification, landslide health impact, environmental factors, and emergency response were significantly related to landslide risk perception. In summary, the XGB model is feasible in the assessment of landslide susceptibility; the prediction performance is also robust and produced better prediction capacities compared to other ML models.

In the study, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), CatBoost, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used as tree-based machine learning algorithms. Thus, comparing the prediction performances of these algorithms was established as the second aim of the study. For this purpose, 14 conditioning factors were used to create LMSs. The conditioning factors are: lithology, altitude, land cover, aspect, slope, slope length and steepness factor (LS-factor), plan and profile curvatures, tree cover density, topographic position index, topographic wetness index, distance to drainage, distance to roads, and distance to faults. The total data set, which includes landslide and non-landslide pixels, was split into two parts: training data set (70%) and validation data set (30%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) method was used to evaluate the prediction performances of the models. The AUC values showed that the CatBoost (AUC = 0.988) had the highest prediction performance, followed by XGBoost (AUC = 0.987), RF (AUC = 0.985), and GBM (ACU = 0.975) algorithms. Although the AUC values of the models were close to each other, the CatBoost performed slightly better than the other models.

Accurate landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is crucial for sustainable development. Machine learning has recently become an important means of LSM. However, the accuracy of machine learning models is limited by the heterogeneity of environmental factors and the imbalance of samples, especially for large-scale LSM. To address these problems, we created an improved random forest (RF)-based LSM model and applied it to Guangdong Province, China. First, the RF-based LSM model was constructed using rainfall-induced landslide samples and 13 environmental factors and by exploring the optimal positive-to-negative and training-to-test sample ratios. Second, the performance of the RF-based LSM model was evaluated and compared with three other machine learning models. The results indicate that: (1) the proposed RF-based model has the best performance with the highest area under curve (AUC) of 0.9145, based on optimal positive-to-negative and training-to-test sample ratios of 1:1 and 8:2, respectively; (2) the introduction of rainfall and global human modification (GHM) can increase the AUC from 0.8808 to 0.9145; and (3) rainfall and topography are two dominant factors in Guangdong landslides.

One important aspect of effectively utilizing these algorithms is tuning the hyperparameters to match the specific task at hand. The selection and configuration of hyperparameters directly impact the performance of machine learning models. Achieving optimal hyperparameter settings often requires a deep understanding of the underlying models and the appropriate optimization techniques. While there are many automatic optimization techniques available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, this article focuses on hyperparameter optimization for well-known machine learning models. It explores cutting-edge optimization methods such as metaheuristic algorithms, deep learning-based optimization, Bayesian optimization, and quantum optimization, and our paper focused mainly on metaheuristic and Bayesian optimization techniques and provides guidance on applying them to different machine learning algorithms. The article also presents real-world applications of hyperparameter optimization by conducting tests on spatial data collections for landslide susceptibility mapping. Based on the experiment’s results, both Bayesian optimization and metaheuristic algorithms showed promising performance compared to baseline algorithms. For instance, the metaheuristic algorithm boosted the random forest model’s overall accuracy by 5% and 3%, respectively, from baseline optimization methods GS and RS, and by 4% and 2% from baseline optimization methods GA and PSO. Additionally, for models like KNN and SVM, Bayesian methods with Gaussian processes had good results. When compared to the baseline algorithms RS and GS, the accuracy of the KNN model was enhanced by BO-TPE by 1% and 11%, respectively, and by BO-GP by 2% and 12%, respectively. For SVM, BO-TPE outperformed GS and RS by 6% in terms of performance, while BO-GP improved results by 5%. The paper thoroughly discusses the reasons behind the efficiency of these algorithms. By successfully identifying appropriate hyperparameter configurations, this research paper aims to assist researchers, spatial data analysts, and industrial users in developing machine learning models more effectively.

The observed 169 historical landslides were classified into two groups: 70% (118 landslides) for training and 30% (51 landslides) for validation. To compare and validate the performance of the three models, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were utilized. Specifically, the success rates of the CDT model, AdaCDT model, and RSCDT model were 0.788, 0.821, and 0.847, respectively, while the corresponding prediction rates were 0.771, 0.802, and 0.861, respectively. In sum, the two ensemble models can effectively improve the performance accuracy of an individual CDT model, and the RSCDT model was proven to be superior to the other two models.

Aiming at the problems of insufficient samples for landslide compilation, difficulty in expanding landslide samples, and insufficient expression of nonlinear relationships among evaluation factors, this paper proposes a new evaluation method of landslide susceptibility combining deep autoencoder and multi-scale residual network (DAE-MRCNN). In the first step, a deep autoencoder network was used to learn the feature expression of the original landslide data in order to acquire effective features in the data. Next, a multi-scale residual network was constructed; specifically, the model was improved into a deep residual network model by adding skip connections in the convolutional layer. In addition, the multi-scale idea was utilized to fully extract the scale characteristics of the evaluation factors. Finally, the model was used for feature training, and the results were input into the Softmax classifier to complete the prediction of landslide susceptibility. For this purpose, a machine learning method and two state-of-the-art deep learning methods, namely SVM, CPCNN-ML, and 2D-CNN, were utilized to model landslide susceptibility in Hanzhong City, Shaanxi Province. The proposed method produced the highest model performance of 0.891, followed by 0.842, 0.869, and 0.873. The experimental results show that the DAE-MRCNN method can fully express the complex nonlinear relationships among the evaluation factors, alleviate the problem of insufficient samples in convolutional neural networks (CNN) training, and significantly improve the accuracy of susceptibility prediction. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15030653,4,4,Yes,"AE,RNN",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The performance of frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV), logistic regression (LR), and maximum entropy (ME) methods were tested and compared for modeling shallow landslide susceptibility in Calabria region, (South Italy). A landslide database of 22,028 shallow landslides, randomly split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets, was combined with 15 predisposing factors (lithology, soil texture, soil bulk density, soil erodibility, drainage density, land use, elevation, local relief, slope gradient, slope aspect, plan curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, topographic ruggedness index, and topographic position index) to calibrate and validate the models. The robustness of the models in response to changes in the landslide dataset was explored through ten training and test sets replicates. The performance of these models was evaluated using several statistical indices and the ROC curve method. The results showed that all the four methods applied achieve promising performance on the prediction of shallow landslide susceptibility at regional scale. The comparison between four methods displayed that the ME is the best performing (AUC = 0.866), followed by the LR (AUC = 0.845), FR (AUC = 0.813), and finally IV (AUC = 0.800).

A historical landslide inventory and 24 different landslide influencing factors (LIFs) were prepared using remotely sensed and auxiliary datasets. The LIFs were evaluated using multi-collinearity statistics and their relative importance was measured to select the most discriminative LIFs using the ensemble feature selection method, which was developed using Chi-square, gain ratio, and relief-F methods. We evaluated the performance of ten different ML algorithms (linear discriminant analysis, mixture discriminant analysis, bagged cart, boosted logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forest, rotation forest, and C5.0) using different accuracy statistics (sensitivity, specificity, area under curve (AUC), and overall accuracy (OA)). We used suitable combinations of individual ML models to develop different ensemble ML models and evaluated their performance in LSM. We assessed the impact of LIFs on ML performance. Among all individual ML models, the k-nearest neighbors (sensitivity = 0.72, specificity = 0.82, AUC = 0.86, OA = 78%) and artificial neural network (sensitivity = 0.71, specificity = 0.85, AUC = 0.87, OA = 79%) algorithms showed the best performance using the top five LIFs, while random forest, rotation forest, and C5.0 (sensitivity = 0.76–0.81, specificity = 0.87, AUC = 0.90–0.93, OA = 82–84%) outperformed other models when developed using all twenty-four LIFs.

To produce the landslide susceptibility map, an ensemble machine learning algorithm, random forest, was chosen because of its known performance in similar studies. The modified analytical hierarchical process method was used to produce the flood susceptibility map by using factor scores that were defined specifically for the area in the study. The seismic hazard was assessed using ground motion parameters based on Arias intensity values. The univariate maps were synthesized with a Mamdani fuzzy inference system using membership functions designated by expert. The results show that the random forest provided an overall accuracy of 92.3% for landslide susceptibility mapping.

This study aims to comprehensively compare multiple models, including linear, nonlinear, and ensemble models, based on 5281 historical landslides in southwest China, the area most severely affected by the landslide disaster. Linear models represented by logistic regression (LR), nonlinear models represented by support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and classification 5.0 decision tree (C5.0 DT), and ensemble models represented by random forest (RF) and categorical boosting (Catboost) were selected. The correlation coefficient, variance inflation factor (VIF), and relative important analysis were used to select the dominate landslide conditioning factors. Using multiple statistical indicators (e.g. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and Kappa), cross-validation and qualitative methods to evaluate the models’ performance. The findings are: (1) Regarding the model predictive performance, the best predictive performance was demonstrated by the ensemble models Catboost (AUC = 0.823 and Kappa = 0.593) and RF (AUC = 0.821 and Kappa = 0.582), followed by the nonlinear models SVM (AUC = 0.775 and Kappa = 0.520), ANN (AUC = 0.770 and Kappa = 0.486) and C5.0 DT (AUC = 0.751 and Kappa = 0.497), while the linear model LR (AUC = 0.756 and Kappa = 0.456) had a more limited performance. The ensemble model, which uses a tree as its baseline classifier, has a lot of potential for studies into the landslide susceptibility. (2) Regarding the model robustness, the three types of models in nonspatial cross-validation (CV) performed relatively similarly in terms of predictive power, while in spatial cross-validation (SPCV), the linear model LR (median AUC = 0.714) achieved better results than the ensemble and nonlinear models. It implies that when the distribution of landslides is not homogeneous, linear models may be the most robust. It is advisable to consider various evaluation metrics from different perspectives and integrate them with specialist qualitative geomorphological empirical knowledge to determine the best model.

First, using the MIL framework, the network is trained only by the scene-level samples and it reduces the need for pixel-level samples. Second, a change-detection network architecture using a two-stream U-Net with shared weights is designed to learn the deep features of the landslide from the two-period aerial images, reducing the false-positive results. Third, integrating a gated attention-based pooling layer and a fast level-set evolution algorithm can finally produce the pixel-level results.

The results indicate that the predictive capability of the FPA is very good for landslide susceptibility mapping on both training (AUC = 0.935) and validating (AUC = 0.882) datasets. Thus, the novel FPA based ML model can be utilized for the development of accurate landslide susceptibility map of the study area and this approach can also be applied in other landslide prone areas.

However, the inventory / data imbalance (DI) problem remains one of the challenges in this domain. This problem exists as a good quality landslide inventory map, including a complete record of historical data, is difficult or expensive to collect. As such, this can considerably affect oneâs ability to obtain a sufficient inventory or representative samples. This research developed a new approach based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) to correct imbalanced landslide datasets. The proposed method was tested at Chukha Dzongkhag, Bhutan, one of the most frequent landslide prone areas in the Himalayan region. The proposed approach was then compared with the standard methods such as the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), dense imbalanced sampling, and sparse sampling (i.e., producing non-landslide samples as many as landslide samples). The comparisons were based on five machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), and the support vector machine (SVM). The model evaluation was carried out based on overall accuracy (OA), Kappa Index, F1-score, and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). The spatial database was established with a total of 269 landslides and 10 conditioning factors, including altitude, slope, aspect, total curvature, slope length, lithology, distance from the road, distance from the stream, topographic wetness index (TWI), and sediment transport index (STI). The findings of this study have shown that both GAN and SMOTE data balancing approaches have helped to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. According to AUROC, the GAN method was able to boost the models by reaching the maximum accuracy of ANN (0.918), RF (0.933), DT (0.927), kNN (0.878), and SVM (0.907) when default parameters used. With the optimum parameters, all models performed best with GAN at their highest accuracy of ANN (0.927), RF (0.943), DT (0.923) and kNN (0.889), except SVM obtained the highest accuracy of (0.906) with SMOTE. Our finding suggests that RF balanced with GAN can provide the most reasonable criterion for landslide prediction. This research indicates that landslide data balancing may substantially affect the predictive capabilities of machine learning models. Therefore, the issue of DI in the spatial prediction of landslides should not be ignored. Future studies could explore other generative models for landslide data balancing. By using state-of-the-art GAN, the proposed model can be considered in the areas where the data are limited or imbalanced. Â© 2021 by the authors.

The results of these methods are sensitive to different factors, such as the quality of input data, choice of algorithm, sampling strategies, and data splitting ratios. In this study, five different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used for LSM for the Wayanad district in Kerala, India, using two different sampling strategies and nine different train to test ratios in cross validation. The results show that Random Forest (RF), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms provide better results than NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) and Logistic Regression (LR) for the study area. NB and LR algorithms are less sensitive to the sampling strategy and data splitting, while the performance of the other three algorithms is considerably influenced by the sampling strategy. From the results, both the choice of algorithm and sampling strategy are critical in obtaining the best suited landslide susceptibility map for a region. The accuracies of KNN, RF, and SVM algorithms have increased by 10.51%, 10.02%, and 4.98% with the use of polygon landslide inventory data, while for NB and LR algorithms, the performance was slightly reduced with the use of polygon data. Thus, the sampling strategy and data splitting ratio are less consequential with NB and algorithms, while more data points provide better results for KNN, RF, and SVM algorithms.

Deep learning algorithms, especially fully convolutional networks (FCNs), and variations like the ResU-Net have been used recently as rapid and automatic landslide detection approaches. Although FCNs have shown cutting-edge results in automatic landslide detection, accuracy can be improved by adding prior knowledge through possible frameworks. This study evaluates a rule-based object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach built on probabilities resulting from the ResU-Net model for landslide detection. We train the ResU-Net model using a landslide dataset comprising landslide inventories from various geographic regions, including our study area and test the testing area not used for training. In the OBIA stage, we first calculate land cover and image difference indices for pre-and post-landslide multi-temporal images. Next, we use the generated indices and the resulting ResU-Net probabilities for image segmentation; the extracted landslide object candidates are then optimized using rule-based classification. In the result validation section, the landslide detection of the proposed integration of the ResU-Net with a rule-based classification of OBIA is compared with that of the ResU-Net alone.

A comprehensive landslide inventory and susceptibility assessment of this region are not available, even though this region is prone to frequent disruption by geological hazards, mainly landslides. To achieve this objective, an inventory map and 12 variables (including geomorphic, geological, hydrological and environmental factors) are created. The inventory dataset is divided to training dataset with 148 landslides (70%) and validation dataset with 64 landslides (30%). Then, 2 machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to learn the internal relationship between the target set (212 landslide locations) and the 12 variables as inputs. The used methods are Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Their performances are assessed through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the standard error (Std. error), and the confidence interval (CI) at 95%. As the main results, RF and XGBoost models give identical predictive accuracy (AUC) of ? 90%. This indicates that the proposed procedure can be useful for handling and monitoring present and future landslides. In addition, the models proposed in this study will be useful for the continuous assessment of land degradation trends for this region. Therefore, presenting these models in the best possible way allows stakeholders to benefit from them to identify key areas that may be targeted for protection and restoration procedures to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) goals by 2030.

The objective of this study was to conduct a landslide hazard susceptibility assessment for Ruijin, Jiangxi, China, and to provide technical support to the local government for implementing disaster reduction and prevention measures. Machine learning approaches, e.g., random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs) were employed and multiple geo-environmental factors such as land cover, NDVI, landform, rainfall, lithology, and proximity to faults, roads, and rivers, etc., were utilized to achieve our purposes. For categorical factors, three processing approaches were proposed: simple numerical labeling (SNL), weight assignment (WA)-based and frequency ratio (FR)-based. Then 19 geo-environmental factors were respectively converted into raster to constitute three 19-band da-tasets, i.e., DS1, DS2, and DS3 from three different processes. Then, 155 observed landslides that occurred in the past decades were vectorized, among which 70% were randomly selected to com-pose a training set (TS1) and the remaining 30% to form a validation set (VS1). A number of non-landslide (no-risk) samples distributed in the whole study area were identified in low slope (<1â3Â°) zones such as urban areas and croplands, and also added to the TS1 and VS1 in the same ratio. For comparison, we used the FR approach to identify the no-risk samples in both flat and non-flat areas, and merged them into the field-observed landslides to constitute another pair of training and validation sets (TS2 and VS2) using the same ratio of 7:3. The RF algorithm was applied to model the probability of the landslide occurrence using DS1, DS2, and DS3 as predictive variables and TS1 and TS2 for training to obtain the SNL-based, WA-based, and FR-based RF models, respectively. Verified against VS1 and VS2, the three models have similar overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (KC), which are 89.61%, 91.47%, and 94.54%, and 0.7926, 0.8299, and 0.8908, respectively. All of them are much better than the three models obtained by SVM algorithm with OA of 81.79%, 82.86%, and 83%, and KC of 0.6337, 0.655, and 0.660. New case verification with the recent 26 landslide events of 2017â2020 revealed that the landslide susceptibility map from WA-based RF modeling was able to properly identify the high and very high susceptibility zones where 23 new landslides had occurred, and performed better than the SNL-based and FR-based RF modeling, though the latter has a slightly higher OA and KC. Hence, we concluded that all three RF models achieve reasonable risk prediction, but WA-based and FR-based RF modeling deserves a recommendation for application elsewhere. The results of this study may serve as reference for the local authorities in prevention and early warning of landslide hazards. Â© 2021 by the authors.

However, compared with landslides induced by earthquakes, inventories of landslides induced by heavy rainfall are much less common. In this study we used high-precision remote sensing images before and after continuous heavy rainfall in southern Tianshui, China, from 20 June to 25 July 2013, to produce an inventory of 14,397 shallow landslides. Based on the results of landslide inventory, we utilized machine learning and the geographic information system (GIS) to map landslide susceptibility in this area and evaluated the relative weight of various factors affecting landslide development. First, 18 variables related to geomorphic conditions, slope material, geological conditions, and human activities were selected through collinearity analysis; second, 21 selected machine learning models were trained and optimized in the Python environment to evaluate the susceptibility of landslides. The results showed that the ExtraTrees model was the most effective for landslide susceptibility assessment, with an accuracy of 0.91. This predictive ability means that our landslide susceptibility results can be used in the implementation of landslide prevention and mitigation measures in the region. Analysis of the importance of the factors showed that the contribution of slope aspect (SA) was significantly higher than that of the other factors, followed by planar curvature (PLC), distance to river (DR), distance to fault (DTF), normalized difference vehicle index (NDVI), distance to road (DTR), and other factors.

The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) models were used to compare and forecast the association between causative parameters and landslides. These advanced machine learning (ML) models can measure environmental issues and risks for any area on a regional scale. Initially, 74 landslide locations were determined along the KKH to prepare the landslide inventory map using different data. The landslides were randomly divided into two sets for training and validation at a proportion of 7/3. Fifteen landslide conditioning variables were produced for susceptibility mapping. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar persistent scatterer interferometry (PS-InSAR) technique investigated the deformation movement of extracted models in the susceptible zones. It revealed a high line of sight (LOS) deformation velocity in both modelsâ sensitive zones. For accuracy comparison, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve approach was used, which showed 93.44% and 92.22% accuracy for XGBoost and RF, respectively. The XGBoost method produced superior results, combined with PS-InSAR results to create a new LSM for the area.

However, in most of the previous studies, the distribution of input data was assumed as being, and treated, as normal or Gaussian; this assumption is not always valid as ML is heavily dependent on the quality of the input data. Therefore, we examine the effectiveness of six feature transformations (minimax normalization (Std-X), logarithmic functions (Log-X), reciprocal function (Rec-X), power functions (Power-X), optimal features (Opt-X), and one-hot encoding (Ohe-X) over the 11conditioning factors (i.e., altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, distance to road, distance to lineament, distance to stream, terrain roughness index (TRI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, and vegetation density). We selected the frequent landslide-prone area in the Cameron Highlands in Malaysia as a case study to test this novel approach. These transformations were then assessed by three benchmark ML methods, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGB), logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The 10-fold cross-validation method was used for model evaluations.

In this research, we introduced a novel hybrid artificial intelligence approach of rotation forest (RF) as a meta classifier based on reduced error pruning tree (REPTree) as a base classifier called RF-REPTree, for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in the Kalaleh watershed, Golestan Province, Iran. Some benchmark models, including the open-source Java decision tree (J48), naive Bayes tree (NBTree), and REPTree were used to compare the designed model. A total of 249 landslide locations were identified and mapped. The group was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) data for modelling and reliability analysis. Based on a literature review and multi-collinearity tests, 16 landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were selected. Of the LCFs, the topographical position index (TPI) had the highest correlation with landslide occurrence. The LSM produced by RF-REPTree revealed that nearly 29% of the study areas have high to very high landslide susceptibility (LS). Statistical analysis of the model results included the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the efficiency test, the true skill statistic (TSS), and the kappa index. ROC demonstrated that the AUC values of RF-REPTree, REPTree, J48, and NBTree models were 0.832, 0.700, 0.695, and 0.759 for succession rate curves and 0.794, 0.740, 0.788, and 0.728 for prediction rate curves, respectively. Therefore, all models were judged to be acceptably accurate for LSM. Among the LS models, the RF-REPTree model achieved the highest accuracy, followed by REPTree, J48, and NBTree.

To overcome these restrictions, ensembling DL models has often been preferred as a practical solution. In this study, an ensemble DL architecture, based on shared blocks, was proposed to improve the prediction capability of individual DL models. For this purpose, three DL models, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), together with their ensemble form (CNNâRNNâLSTM) were utilized to model landslide susceptibility in Trabzon province, Turkey.

Understanding the critical combination of geoenvironmental factors involved in the occurrence of landslides can mitigate the adverse impacts ascribed to them. Among the several scenarios for studying and investigating this phenomenon, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is the most prominent method. Applying the machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated with the geographic information systems (GIS) has become a trending means for accurate and rapid landslide mapping practices in the scientific community. Support vector machine (SVM) has been the most commonly applied ML algorithm for LSM in recent years. The current study aims to implement different SVM kernel functions including polynomial kernel function (PKF) (degree 1 to 5), radial basis function (RBF), sigmoid, and linear kernels, for a GIS-based LSM over the Tabriz Basin (TB). To this end, a total number of 9 conditioning parameters being involved in the occurrence of the landslide events were determined and utilized. The LSM maps of the TB were generated based on the different SVM kernels and were statistically validated according to the landslide inventory. The findings revealed that the polynomial-degree-2 (PKF-2) model (AUC = 0.9688) outperforms the rest of the utilized kernels. According to the SLM map generated through PKF-2, the northernmost parts of the TB are extremely susceptible to slope failures than the rest; therefore, the developmental policies over these parts have to be taken into account with privileged priority to hinder any humanitarian as well as environmental catastrophes.

Prior to the development of the model, we analyzed landslide inventory for understanding the complexity and scope of alternative landslide susceptibility mapping. We conducted this work by examining a case study of Kalimpong region (Himalayas), characterized by different types of landslides. The landslide inventory was analyzed based on its differential attributes, such as movement types, state of activity, material type, distribution, style, and failure mechanism. From the landslide inventory, debris slides, rockslides, and rockfalls were identified to generate two landslide susceptibility models using deep learning algorithms.

To mitigate landslide risk, building a prediction model which could provide information on both spatial and temporal probabilities of landslide occurrence is essential but challenging. In this paper, real-time rainfall conditions are incorporated into landslide prediction through a unique rainstorm-based database of reported landslides. Other landslide controlling factors related to topography, geology, and land cover are also considered. Five machine learning methods, including logistic regression, random forest, adaboost tree, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron, are utilized and compared. Validated against historical rainstorms, the machine learning powered landslide prediction model could reasonably forecast the occurrence of landslides in a spatiotemporal context. Moreover, the effects of different rainstorm characteristics in terms of distinct rainfall spatial distribution and intensity on landslide susceptibility could also be captured by this model. For the landslide controlling factors investigated, rolling rainfall factors are proven to play a more important role than antecedent rainfall factors for landslide prediction.

Recently, supervised DL models using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely studied for landslide detection. Even though these models provide robust performance and reliable results, they depend highly on a large labeled dataset for their training step. As an alternative, in this paper, we developed an unsupervised learning model by employing a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) to deal with the problem of limited labeled data for training. The CAE was used to learn and extract the abstract and high-level features without using training data. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, we used Sentinel-2 imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM) to map landslides in three different case studies in India, China, and Taiwan. Using minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation, we reduced the multispectral dimension to three features containing more than 80% of scene information. Next, these features were stacked with slope data and NDVI as inputs to the CAE model. The Huber reconstruction loss was used to evaluate the inputs. We achieved reconstruction losses ranging from 0.10 to 0.147 for the MNF features, slope, and NDVI stack for all three study areas. The mini-batch K-means clustering method was used to cluster the features into two to five classes. To evaluate the impact of deep features on landslide detection, we first clustered a stack of MNF features, slope, and NDVI, then the same ones plus with the deep features. For all cases, clustering based on deep features provided the highest precision, recall, F1-score, and mean intersection over the union in landslide detection. Â© 2021 by the authors.

To compare different machine learning models for landslide susceptibility mapping, landslide susceptibility maps were developed using traditional (logistic regression) and modern techniques (decision tree). Results show that the spatial pattern of susceptibility map from logistic regression is continuously distributed, whereas that from the decision tree is crisp and sharp. From both models, consistent results show that the most important critical factors are completely different for both the earthquake- and typhoon-triggered landslides. For rainfall-triggered landslides in Taiwan, the most important factor of landslide susceptibility is the distance to the rivers, whereas, for earthquake-triggered landslides in Pakistan, the most important one is geological formations.

The automated GIW system is coordinated between machine learning technologies, web technologies, and application programming interfaces (APIs). The new bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) algorithm is presented to forecast landslides. The proposed algorithm consists of 3 major steps, the first of which is the construction of a landslide dataset by using Quantum GIS (QGIS). The second step is to generate the landslide-risk model based on machine learning approaches. Finally, the automated landslide-risk visualization illustrates the likelihood of landslide via Google Maps on the website. Four static factors are considered for landslide-risk prediction, namely, land cover, soil properties, elevation and slope, and a single dynamic factor i.e., precipitation. Data are collected to construct a geospatial landslide database which comprises three historical landslide locations-Phu Chifa at Thoeng District, Ban Pha Duea at Mae Salong Nai, and Mai Salong Nok in Mae Fa Luang District, Chiang Rai, Thailand. Data collection is achieved using QGIS software to interpolate contour, elevation, slope degree and land cover from the Google satellite images, aerial and site survey photographs while the physiographic and rock type are on-site surveyed by experts.

A QA approach based on the landslide activity after a triggering event can be useful for the performance evaluation of the methods used for LSM production. Landslides triggered by earthquakes can be employed for this purpose as they occur frequently throughout the active seismic regions of the world. After an earthquake occurred in Elazig, Turkey on 24 Jan 2020 (Mw 6.8), several landslides were activated in the mountainous parts. Here, the performances of two state-of-the-art machine learning methods, i.e., the random forest (RF) and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were investigated using the activated landslides. The landslide inventory was derived in a previous study by using pre- and post-event aerial photogrammetric datasets and classified according to their activity types and temporal observations. The classes observed in the pre-event photogrammetric datasets were inactive (L1) and active mass movements (L2). The ones observed in the post-event photogrammetric datasets were new active zones inside the existing landslide (L3) and new activity (L4). Here, only the L1 and L2 type landslides observed in a part of the study area were used for the model training and the LSMs were produced for the whole area to investigate the model transferability. The L3 and L4 type landslides were used for validation. In addition, the area under curve (AUC) values obtained from the methods and the volumetric change maps obtained from the pre- and post-event digital elevation models were also used for the performance assessment. The results demonstrated that RF exhibited higher classification accuracy (AUC = 0.93) than MLP (AUC = 0.87); and accurate LSMs could be produced by using a sub-part of the basin for training.

As a result, future resource management will necessitate landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) using the best conditioning factors. In Aqabat Al-Sulbat, Asir province, Saudi Arabia, the goal of this study was to find optimal conditioning parameters dependent hybrid LSM. LSM was created using machine learning methods such as random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural network (ANN). To build ensemble models, the LR was combined with RF and ANN models. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to validate the LSMs and determine which models were the best. Then, utilising random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), and correlation feature selection, sensitivity analysis was carried out. Through sensitivity analysis, the most relevant conditioning factors were determined, and the best model was applied to the important parameters to build a highly robust LSM with fewer variables. The ROC curve was also used to evaluate the final model. The results show that two hybrid models (LR-ANN and LR-RF) were predicted the very high as 29.67â32.73 km2 and high LS regions as 21.84â33.38 km2, with LR predicting 22.34km2 as very high and 45.15km2 as high LS zones. The LR-RF appeared as best model (AUC: 0.941), followed by LR-ANN (AUC: 0.915) and LR (AUC: 0.872). Sensitivity analysis, on the other hand, allows for the exclusion of aspects, hillshade, drainage density, curvature, and TWI from LSM. The LSM was then predicted using the LR-RF model based on the remaining nine conditioning factors. With fewer variables, this model has achieved greater accuracy (AUC: 0.927). This comes very close to being the best hybrid model. As a result, it is strongly advised to choose conditioning parameters with caution, as redundant parameters would result in less resilient LSM. As a consequence, both time and resources would be saved, and precise LSM would indeed be possible.

These discrete variables have random fluctuations and are sensitive to the errors of point or line elements, leading to a decrease of landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) accuracy. This study proposes continuous conditioning factors such as river density and road density to improve the suitability of the linear factors. Xunwu County in China is taken as an example; 337 historical landslides and 12 conditioning factors are acquired. First, the distance to rivers and roads and other 10 conditioning factors together constitute the original factors of LSP. Second, the distance to rivers and distance to roads are replaced by the road density and river density, respectively, to constitute the improved factors. Third, based on the support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF), original factor- and improved factor-based SVM, LR, and RF models are constructed for comparisons. Finally, the LSP uncertainty is evaluated. Results show that (1) the improved factor-based models have higher LSP accuracies than original factor-based models, indicating that density factors are more feasible than linear factors with more explicit physical meaning; (2) landslide susceptibility indexes distribution features indicate that improved factor-based models reduce the uncertainty of LSP; (3) spatial density factors do not reduce the importance of conditioning factors in both original factor- and improved factor-based models.

As a result, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) plays an important role in the landslide prevention system. Recently, many deep learning (DL) models have been adopted for LSM, but they also face problems such as sensitivity to overfitting and lower mapping accuracy. In this paper, a novel hybrid LSM framework is proposed based on four heterogeneous ensemble learning (HEL) methods with three single DL models: deep belief network (DBN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep residual network (ResNet). The proposed model is tested at the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. 202 historical landslides and ten conditioning factors were selected to construct a geospatial dataset for LSM. The conditioning factors with high-correlation and low importance were removed from the dataset by using the Spearman Correlation Index and random forests. The geospatial dataset was then divided into two subsets: 70% for training and 30% for testing. Then LSM results was carried out by the single and proposed HEL-based models. The quantitative evaluation of the results showed that the proposed HEL-based models improved the LSM accuracy, and outperformed the single DL LSM models. Stacking model achieved the highest AUC value (0.984), highest Kappa (86.95%), highest overall accuracy (94.17%), highest precision (88.87%), highest Matthews correlation coefficient (87.03%) and highest F1-score (91.34%) among all of models for the testing dataset, while the Boosting model obtained the highest Recall value (96.02%). At the same time, HEL-based models proposed in this study also show better stability and can avoid the overfitting effectively. In addition, the Gini index showed that elevation factor contributes most in LSM in the study area. In general, the proposed framework has promising applicability in improving LSM accuracy.

Initially, a landslide inventory of 200 samples was produced along with an additional 200 samples indicating nonlandslide areas and divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) groups using a stratified loop-based random sampling approach. Then, a geospatial database of 12 possible landslide influencing factors (LIFs) was generated, including elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), distance to drainage, distance to fault, distance to road, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, land cover/land use (LCLU), and a geological map of the study area. None of the LIFs were redundant for the modeling, as indicated by the multicollinearity test (tolerance > 0.1) and information gain ratio (IGR > 0). We extended the evaluation measures of each algorithm from area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis to the calculation of performance overall (POA) with the help of precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy (ACC), and Matthewâs correlation coefficient (MCC). The results showed that the SVM was the most promising model (AUC = 0.969, POA = 2669) for the LSM, followed by RF (AUC = 0.967, POA = 2656), GBM (AUC = 0.967, POA = 2623), maxENT (AUC = 0.872, POA = 1761), and LR (AUC = 0.836, POA = 1299). It is important to note that the SVM, RF, and GBM were the top performers, with almost similar accuracy. Thus, each of these could be equally effective for LSM and can be used for risk reduction and mitigation measures in the rugged terrain of Pakistan and other regions with similar topography.

Here, we applied multiple machine learning models and their ensemble to explore factors controlling the TL and map its susceptibility at a fine resolution. The models were calibrated and validated using a split-sample approach based on an inventory of TLs from the remote sensing data. The models indicated that summer air temperature and rainfall were the most two important factors controlling the occurrence and distribution of TLs, provided that other geomorphic conditions (i.e., slope, solar radiation, and fine soil) were suitable. The final ensemble susceptibility map based on downscaled climate data and terrain data suggested that ca. 1.4% of the QTP land was classified in high- to very high-susceptibility zone, which is likely to increase in response to future climate change. This study integrated local topography and climate in susceptibility modeling and provided new insights into the geomorphic sensitivity to climate change but also the engineering support over the QTP.

The study used different machine learning methods to identify potential active landslides along a 15 km buffer zone on both sides of Jinsha River (Panzhihua-Huize section), China. The morphology and texture features of landslides were characterized with InSAR deformation monitoring data and high-resolution optical remote sensing data, combined with 17 landslide influencing factors. In the study area, 83 deformation accumulation areas of potential landslide hazards and 54 deformation accumulation areas of non-potential landslide hazards were identified through spatial overlay analysis with 64 potential active landslides, which have been confirmed by field verification. The Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were trained and tested through attribute selection and parameter optimization. Among the 17 landslide influencing factors, Drainage Density, NDVI, Slope and Weathering Degree play an indispensable role in the machine learning and recognition of landslide hazards in our study area, while other influencing factors play a certain role in different algorithms. A multi-index (Precision, Recall, F1) comparison shows that the SVM (0.867, 0.829, 0.816) has better recognition precision skill for small-scale unbalanced landslide deformation datasets, followed by RF (0.765, 0.756, 0.741), DT (0.755, 0.756, 0.748) and NB (0.659, 0.659, 0.659). Different from the previous study on landslide susceptibility and hazard mapping based on machine learning, this study focuses on how to find out the potential active landslide points more accurately, rather than evaluating the landslide susceptibility of specific areas to tell us which areas are more sensitive to landslides. This study verified the feasibility of early identification of landslide hazards by using different machine learning methods combined with deformation information and multi-source landslide influencing factors rather than by relying on human-computer interaction. This study shows that the efficiency of potential hazard identification can be increased while reducing the subjective bias caused by relying only on human experts.

For this aim, three probabilistic models were used namely: multilayer perceptron Artificial Neural Networks with a Back-Propagation algorithm (BPANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and the coupled ANFIS-Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ANFIS-ICA). An all-inclusive landslide inventory map was prepared together with ten pivotal geo-environmental and anthropogenic landslide-controlling factors. Three indices including Pierce Skill Score (PSS), Cohenâs kappa, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) were calculated from the confusion matrix and used to assess the performance of the models. Results in the validation stage revealed that the ensemble of ANFIS-ICA outperformed its counterparts with the respective PSS, kappa, and AUROC values of 0.766, 0.792, 0.966, followed by ANFIS (0.629, 0.666, 0.902), and ANN (0.603, 0.652, 0.866). Regarding the superior model (ANFIS-ICA), about 27% of the study area falls within high landslide susceptibility zones which needs to be considered for further risk mitigation measures and pragmatic actions. Our results pinpointed the outstanding performance of ANFIS-ICA ensemble in landslide susceptibility modeling at the watershed scale. Furthermore, it was found that the ANFIS-ICA model borrows most of its susceptibility pattern and performance from the distance to roads factor, although the total performance of the model is derived from the integration of all the factors. Moreover, this study attested to the advantages of hybrid algorithms and showed that the integration of machine learning models with evolutionary algorithms can be a new horizon to ensemble modeling. Utilization of well-adjusted ensemble models is pivotal for natural resource managers due particularly to their enhanced prediction powers which, in turn, can significantly reduce the social-economic losses emanated from failed predictions.

However, most of that recognition was taken manually in the past, which is rather time- and labor- consuming. As the development of technologies of remote sensing and artificial intelligence, the automatic detection of landslides becomes possible. The previous researches relative to the automatic detection of landslides utilized the machine learning methods to detect these new landslides which were significantly distinguished from their context. Compared to those landslides, the detection of old loess landslides that are not distinct from their context is more challenged. We explore the deep learning to automatically detect the old loess landslides.Methods: Firstly, we build a loess landslide database consists of 2 498 which are interpreted from the Google Earth images by experts. Then, we divide the database into three datasets for training, validation and test. Finally, we train Mask R-CNN object detection module with the training dataset, choose the best model by the validation dataset, and apply the best model to the test dataset.Results: The test results of model performance show a precision of 0.56, a recall of 0.72, and a F1-score of 0.63.Conclusions: The results indicate that Mask R-CNN is a robust method even for the detection of loess landslides that are unapparent from the context, and deep learning can provide the possibility for rapid and accurate regional geo-hazard investigation.

A first step towards securing lives and infrastructure is the susceptibility mapping and predicting of occurrence sites of FF. Several studies have been applied using an ensemble machine learning model (EMLM) but measuring FF magnitude using a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (MCL) and geohydrological models have not been widely applied. This study aims to modify a hybrid approach by testing three machine learning models. These are boosted regression tree (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), and naive Bayes tree (NBT) for FF susceptibility mapping at the northern part of the United Arab Emirates (NUAE). This is followed by applying a group of accuracy metrics (precision, recall and F1 score) and the receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The result demonstrated that the BRT has the highest performance for FF susceptibility mapping followed by the CART and NBT. After that, the produced FF map using the BRT was then modified by dividing it into seven basins, and a set of new FF conditioning parameters namely alluvial plain width, basin gradient and mean slope for each basin was calculated for measuring FF magnitude. The results showed that the mountainous and narrower basins (e.g., RAK, Masafi, Fujairah, and Rol Dadnah) have the highest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude, while the wider alluvial plains (e.g., Al Dhaid) have the lowest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude. The proposed approach is an effective approach to improve the susceptibility mapping of FF, landslides, land subsidence, and groundwater potentiality obtained using ensemble machine learning, which is used widely in the literature.

Shaanxi Province, located in northwestern China, is a key area for the prevention and control of landslides in the country. Shaanxi Province has active geological tectonic movements, complex geological conditions, and is affected by various factors such as engineering construction, land resource utilization, mineral resource development, and heavy rainfall. The effects of landslide hazards have increased significantly. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to monitor and predict landslide disasters in Shaanxi Province. Methods: Considering that the existing landslide hazard susceptibility evaluation models cannot eliminate the differences in dimensionality and properties of susceptibility evaluation index factors, we take into account the correlation between susceptibility evaluation index factors and landslide hazard, especially the methods based on classic machine learning with high accuracy still exist some problems such as low training efficiency and difficult parameter selection, landslide susceptibility assessment method incorporating index of entropy based on support vector machine (SVM) is presented using index of entropy (IOE) and particle swarm optimization algorithm(PSO).First, based on the landslide susceptibility evaluation index factors, 8 evaluation factors are selected, such as elevation, slope, aspect, distance from residential area, distance from road, distance from river, lithology and cumulative rainfall. In order to ensure the balance of sample units and the uniform distribution and reduction of non-landslide hazard unit error, non-hazard units with the same number of hazard units are selected randomly in the area 1 km away from the existing hazard point. All the non-hazard units and hazard units are taken as the training data set and verification data set. Then the IOE model is used to calculate the adjustment factor supporting SVM, the PSO algorithm applied to iteratively solve the optimal penalty factor and radial basis kernel function of SVM, and the susceptibility of landslide hazards is obtained according to the membership of the SVM binary classification. At last, the susceptibility partition is divided by the natural breakpoint method.Results: Selecting Shaanxi Province as the experimental area, the proposed method is compared with the SVM method from the three aspects of landslide hazard susceptibility partition map, partition statistics and evaluation model accuracy. Compared with the SVM model, the hazard susceptibility is improved one level is more reasonable for hazard susceptibility zoning in some areas with hazard point distribution. With the increase of hazard susceptibility, the percent of landslide hazard points in each subregion of the two models also gradually increased, reaching the highest in extremely high incidence areas, especially in extremely high incidence areas. The percent of landslide hazard points in the proposed method reached 58.64%, higher than the SVM method.Conclusions: In the landslide hazard-prone area divided by the proposed method, the point density of hazard points is higher, which is more in line with the actual hazard distribution.The receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve shows that the area under curve(AUC) value of the proposed method is 0.89, and the SVM method is 0.82, which is higher than SVM. Based on the experimental results, it is shown that the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method is superior to the SVM method.

Combining 2D decomposition of InSAR velocity vectors and machine learning classification, we develop an automatic approach to characterize the kinematics of each landslide. Then, we sequentially combine principal component and K-medoids cluster analyses to identify groups of slow rock-slope deformations with consistent styles of activity.

Using validation data, the FPA-RF model obtained a maximum AUC value (0.794), followed by the FPA-RS (0.793), FPA-MB (0.788), VFDT-RF (0.746), VFDT-MB (0.741) and VFDT-RS (0.740) models. The FPA-RF model exhibited the most stable and accurate performance in this paper. Among the eleven environmental variables, aspect, land use, and altitude were the most important variables in the combination models. Therefore, the combination models we developed are useful tools that can decrease losses from landslide disasters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Forest Ecology and Management,10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121288,3,3,Yes,"RSS,ROF,MBDT",,Austria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, research on landslide susceptibility modelling has become a topic of relevance and is in constant evolution. Though various machine-learning techniques (MLTs) have been identified for landslide susceptibility modelling, the uncertainty inherent in the models is rarely considered. The present study attempts to quantify the uncertainty associated with landslide prediction models by developing a new methodological framework based on the ensembles of the eight MLTs. This methodology has been tested at the highlands of the southern Western Ghats region (Kerala, India), where landslides have frequently been occurring. Fourteen landslide conditioning factors have been identified as part of this study, and their association was correlated with 671 historic landslides in the study area. The study used four ensemble models such as the mean of probabilities, the median of probabilities, the weighted mean of probabilities, and the committee average. The weighted mean of probability was proved to be the best model based on the average of 800 standalone MLTs, viz., receiver operating characteristics, true skill statistics, and area under curve with corresponding validation scores. Thereafter, an uncertainty analysis was carried out on the coefficient of variation. A confident map was generated to represent the distinct zonation of landslide susceptibility areas with definite uncertainty scales. Nearly 74% of the past landslides fall in the higher susceptibility-low uncertainty category. It is also inferred that such micro-level zonation based on MLTs may improve the efficiency of landslide susceptibility maps and may help in accurately identifying landslide-prone areas in the future. The confident maps thus generated can be used as a ready reference to the planners for the formulation of landslide adaptation strategies at micro-scales. © 2023 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University",Geoscience Frontiers,10.1016/j.gsf.2023.101657,3,3,Yes,"GLM,GBM,CTA,ANN,FDA,MARS,RF,MENT",,"India,Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the locations that are prone to landslides in India's Western Ghats of which Goa is a part. This article presents the LSMs prepared for the state of Goa using four standard machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). In order to create LSMs, a 78-point landslide inventory, as well as 14 landslide conditioning factors, has been used, including slope, elevation, aspect, total curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, yearly rainfall, Stream Power Index, Topographic Wetness Index, distance to road, depth to bedrock/soil depth, soil type, lithology, and land use land cover. The most pertinent features for the models' construction have been chosen using the Pearson correlation coefficient test and the Random Forest method. The presence of landslides is shown to be strongly influenced by the distance to road, slope of the terrain, and the annual rainfall. The LSMs generated were classified into five levels ranging from very low susceptibility level to very high susceptible. The prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC (AUC-ROC), and True Skill Statistics (TSS) have been used to analyse and compare the LSMs created using various methodologies. All of these algorithms perform pretty well, as evidenced by the overall accuracy scores of 81.90% for LR, 83.33% for SVM, 81.94% for KNN, and 86.11% for RF. SVM and RF are the better approaches for forecasting landslide vulnerability in the research area, according to TSS data. The maximum AUC-ROC of 86% was achieved by the RF algorithm. The results of performance metrics lead to the conclusion that the tree-based RF approach is most appropriate for producing LSM for the state of Goa.

To accomplish this, 15 independent variables including 11 static variables, and 4 climatic dynamic variables that can affect landslide susceptibility were applied to predict landslide susceptibility from 3903 landslide susceptibility locations. These data points were separated into two phases for training and testing. Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) downscaled the data and enabled the combination of nine global climate models (GCMs) under shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) to examine the impacts of climate change. The combination of demographic (SSP) and climatic (representative concentration pathways) scenarios were used (e.g., SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 were used to predict precipitation impacts resulting from climate change at four future dates – 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2090. The machine learning algorithms extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) were employed to model and map landslide susceptibility. The area under curve (AUC) results generated with the testing (validation) phase demonstrates that the predictive power is suitable. The RF model produced the best results (AUC = 0.95). The XGBoost model was not as robust (AUC = 0.93). The investigation of how climate change effects on landslide susceptibility in Iran revealed that climate change should cause shifts in the ranges of susceptibility at different times.

The department of Aube in France is well known for several major landslide occurrences. This study focuses on the assessment of Landslide Susceptibility (LS) using the Frequency Ratio (FR) as a statistical method, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, and Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) as machine learning methods in the Aube department, northeast of France. Subsequently, the thematic layers of eight landslide causative factors, including distance to hydrography, density of quarries, elevation, slope, lithology, distance to roads, distance to faults, and rainfall, were generated in the geographic information system (GIS) environment. The thematic layers were integrated and processed to map landslide susceptibility in the study area. On the other hand, an inventory of landslides was carried out based on the database created by the French Geological Survey (BRGM), where 157 landslide occurrences were selected, and then RF and kNN models were trained to generate landslide maps (LSMs) of the study area. The generated maps were assessed by using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC). Subsequently, the accuracy assessment of the FR model revealed more accurate results (AUC = 66.0%) than AHP, outperforming the latter by 6%, while machine learning models results showed that RF gave better results than kNN (<7.3%) with AUC = 95%.

Therefore, landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) constitute an essential tool for effective hazard management and long-term development planning in landslide-prone areas. The aim of this work is to prepare and compare the LSMs by applying GIS-based statistical and machine learning models for the new city of Sidi Abdellah and surrounding areas (Northern Algeria). We implemented the statistical models of the frequency ratio (FR), statistical index (SI), and weights of evidence (WoE) models, and the machine learning models represented by a logistic regression (LR) model for landslide susceptibility prediction. An historical landslide inventory map was produced using the interpretation of Google Earth satellite images, available historical records, and geological field investigations. The obtained landslides were randomly divided into the training (70%) and validation (30%) processes. Furthermore, 12 influencing factors for landslide occurrence (including precipitation, slope, elevation, distance to drainage, aspect, land use, density of streams, distance to road, lithology, distance to fault, seismicity, and density of roads) were selected to prepare thematic maps and were considered for susceptibility analysis. Subsequently, landslide susceptibility assessment and mapping are performed by considering the inventoried landslide events and their related predisposing factors using LR, SI, WoE, and FR models in GIS. The accuracy of the four models was verified, validated, and compared using the area under curve (AUC) value of the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curves (ROC) method. The validation results showed that all the used statistical models provided a good accuracy in predicting landslide susceptibility than the machine learning models, with the SI model having a higher AUC value of 80.1% than the WoE (78.2%), FR (78.2%), and LR (64.2%) models.

However, the problem of sample imbalance in landslide susceptibility assessment, where landslide samples tend to be much smaller than non-landslide samples, is often overlooked. This problem is often one of the important factors affecting the performance of landslide susceptibility models. In this paper, we take the Wanzhou district of Chongqing city as an example, where the total number of data sets is more than 580,000 and the ratio of positive to negative samples is 1:19. We oversample or undersample the unbalanced landslide samples to make them balanced, and then compare the performance of machine learning models with different sampling strategies. Three classic machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, random forest and LightGBM, are used for LSA modeling. The results show that the model trained directly using the unbalanced sample dataset performs the worst, showing an extremely low recall rate, indicating that its predictive ability for landslide samples is extremely low and cannot be applied in practice. Compared with the original dataset, the sample set optimized through certain methods has demonstrated improved predictive performance across various classifiers, manifested in the improvement of AUC value and recall rate.

In this work, four different natural hazards (flood, landslides, forest fire, and earthquake) using support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT), random forest (RF), and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) techniques were created. Effective factors used in the study include elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, rainfall, temperature, lithology, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), wind exposition index (WEI), topographic wetness index (TWI), plan curvature, drainage density, distance from roads, distance from rivers, and distance from villages. The spatial earthquake hazard in the study area was derived from a peak ground acceleration (PGA) susceptibility map. The second step in the study was to combine the model-generated maps of the four hazards in a reliable multi-hazard map. The mean decrease Gini (MDG) method was used to determine the level of importance of each effective factor on the occurrence of landslides, floods, and forest fires. Finally, “area under the curve” (AUC) values were calculated to validate the forest fire, flood, and landslide susceptibility maps and to compare the predictive capability of the machine learning models.

First, according to the landslide catalog database constructed, there were 345 landslides in the study area. Twelve environmental factors were selected, including terrain (elevation, slope, slope direction, plane curvature, and profile curvature), geological structure (stratigraphic lithology and distance from fault zone), meteorological hydrology (average annual rainfall and distance to rivers), and land cover (NDVI, land use, and distance to roads). Then, a single model (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest) and a coupled model (IV–LR, IV–SVM, IV–RF, FR–LR, FR–SVM, and FR–RF) based on information volume and frequency ratio were constructed, and the accuracy and reliability of the models were compared and analyzed. Finally, the influence of environmental factors on landslide susceptibility under the optimal model was discussed. The results showed that the prediction accuracy of the nine models ranged from 75.2% (LR model) to 94.9% (FR–RF model), and the coupling accuracy was generally higher than that of the single model. Therefore, the coupling model could improve the prediction accuracy of the model to a certain extent. The FR–RF coupling model had the highest accuracy. Under the optimal model FR–RF, distance from the road, NDVI, and land use were the three most important environmental factors, ac-counting for 20.15%, 13.37%, and 9.69%, respectively.

With the rapid advancement of multi-source remote sensing techniques and machine learning, remote sensing data-driven landslide prediction methods have attracted increasing attention. However, the lack of an effective and efficient paradigm for organizing multi-source remote sensing data and a unified prediction workflow often results in the weak generalization ability of existing prediction models. In this paper, we propose an improved multi-source data-driven landslide prediction method based on a spatio-temporal knowledge graph and machine learning models. By combining a spatio-temporal knowledge graph and machine learning models, we establish a framework that can effectively organize multi-source remote sensing data and generate unified prediction workflows. Our approach considers the environmental similarity between different areas, enabling the selection of the most adaptive machine learning model for predicting landslides in areas with scarce samples. Experimental results show that our method outperforms machine learning methods, achieving an increase in F1 score by 29% and an improvement in processing efficiency by 93%. Furthermore, by comparing the susceptibility maps generated in real scenarios, we found that our workflow can alleviate the problem of poor prediction performance caused by limited data availability in county-level predictions. This method provides new insights into the development of data-driven landslide evaluation methods, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by limited data availability. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15082126,3,3,No,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, the geospatial database containing 15 landslide conditioning factors related to regional geo-environmental settings and a landslide inventory with 1330 locations are prepared. The landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) reveal that the south-southeastern portion of Meghalaya, mainly slopes along the southern escarpment, are more susceptible to landslides. The model robustness is demonstrated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F1-score, kappa, and other statistical metrics. The XGBoost and RF machine learning models with AUC = 0.971 have shown the best performance, followed by SVM (0.958), KNN (0.951), and ANN (0.945), which is consistent with other applied statistical parameters and higher than the traditional MCDA methods. However, the problem of overestimation is observed in the case of ANN and XGBoost models. The generated LSMs will assist decision-makers and planners in identifying high-risk areas, prioritizing mitigation measures, and guiding regional development. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment,10.1007/s10064-023-03188-2,3,3,Yes,"ANN,XGB,KNN,RF,SVM",,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a semi-integrated supervised approach to improve the prediction performance of machine learning (ML) models in landslide susceptibility studies. First, taking the lower reaches of the Jinsha River as the study area, a geospatial dataset consisting of 349 landslides, an equal number of randomly selected non-landslide points, and 12 environmental factors were randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. Then, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and Bayesian-regularized neural network (BRNN) models were built. Second, the three models were combined to form an integrated weighted model. Very high- and low-prone areas were selected and, combined with the prediction results and remote sensing images, landslide and non-landslide samples were identified. The identified samples were then combined with the original samples to form new samples, which were used to sequentially construct the ensemble-supervised K-nearest neighbors (ESKNN), ensemble-supervised random forest (ESRF), and ensemble-supervised Bayesian-regularized neural network (ESBRNN) models. Finally, the area under the curve (AUC), true skill statistic (TSS), and frequency ratio (FR) values were used to test the accuracy of each model. The traditional ML model results and accuracy were improved by the semi-integrated supervised method. The ESRF model had the best prediction effect (AUC = 0.939, TSS = 0.440, and FR = 95.8%). The proposed semi-integrated supervised ML model solved the problems observed in traditional landslide susceptibility studies and provided insights for reducing variations in model applications, expanding landslide data sources, and improving non-landslide sample selection. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1007/s11356-023-25650-0,3,3,Yes,"KNN,RF,BN",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the risk of landslides in Shenzhen is poorly evaluated. In this article, a landslide risk evaluation (LRE) model is constructed using landslide susceptibility map (LSM) and landslide vulnerability. In the experiment, a stacking ensemble learning (SEL) model is constructed based on convolutional neural network (CNN), multilayer perceptron, gated recurrent unit (GRU), and support vector machine regression to generate LSM by using topography, geology, human engineering activities, time-series precipitation, and time-series normalized difference vegetation index. Road network, building distribution density and annual average precipitation data are used to evaluate landslide vulnerability based on entropy weight method. In this article, multiple statistical indicators are used to evaluate the performance of the LSM model, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) deformation data are utilized to verify the LRE results in Shenzhen. The results show that the SEL method has more refined results for LSM, with a best overall evaluation accuracy, especially in the receiver operating characteristic curve, where the accuracy is improved by nearly 8%. In LRE of Shenzhen, very high, high, moderate, low, and very low risk areas account for 0.283%, 0.451%, 0.859%, 36.890%, and 61.517%, respectively. In most of very high-risk area, InSAR deformation results show a clear concentrated deformation trend with a large deformation rate.

The landslide-inducing factors considered in this study include fault density, lithology, road density, slope, elevation, flow direction, aspect, earthquake intensity, curvature, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), waterways density, rainfall, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The resulting landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) showed that the areas falling under the high and very high susceptibility class have higher rainfall levels, weak lithology, high NDWI, and flow direction.

The contribution of this study is an attempt to develop a state-of-the-art method to assess the effects of climate change and changes in land use/land cover on landslide susceptibility in the Tra Khuc river basin in Vietnam. The method is based on machine learning and remote sensing algorithms, namely radial basis function neural networks–search and rescue optimization (RBFNN–SARO), radial basis function neural network–queuing search algorithm (RBFNN–QSA), radial basis function neural network–life choice-based optimizer (RBFNN–LCBO), radial basis function neural network–dragonfly optimization (RBFNN–DO).

The RBFNN–QSA model performed best, with an AUC value of 0.98, followed by RBFNN–SARO (AUC = 0.97), RBFNN–LCBO (AUC = 0.95), RBFNN–DO (AUC = 0.93), and support vector machine (SVM; AUC = 0.92). The results show that both climate and land use/land cover change greatly in the future: Precipitation increases 18% by 2030 and 25.1% by 2050; the total production forest, protected forest and built-up area change considerably between 2010 and 2050. These changes influence landslide susceptibility: The area of high and very high landslide susceptibility decrease by approximately 100 and 300 km2 respectively in the study area from 2010 to 2050.

For the ensemble models the RF, KLR, MLP and MARS were used as base classifiers, and Bagging was used as meta classifier. Another objective of the current work is to introduce and evaluate the effectiveness of the novel KLR-Bagging and MARS-Bagging ensembles in susceptibility to landslide. Compiling 303 landslide locations to calibrate and test the models, an inventory map was created. Eighteen LCFs were chosen using the Relief-F and multi-collinearity tests for mapping the landslide susceptibility. Applying receiver operating characteristic (ROC), precision, accuracy, incorrectly categorized proportion, mean-absolute-error (MAE), and root-mean-square-error (RMSE), the LSMs were subsequently verified. The different validation results showed RF-Bagging (AUC training 88.69% & testing 92.28%) with ensemble Meta classifier gives better performance than the MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, and MARS-Bagging based LSMs. RF model showed that the slope, altitude, rainfall, and geomorphology played the most vital role in landslide occurrence comparing the other LCFs.

When predicting SSPL, the landslide samples are far less than the non-landslide samples. This class imbalance makes it difficult to predict the SSPL. This paper proposes an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model based on the dice-cross entropy (DCE) loss function and XGBoost (XGBDCE) or Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBDCE) to ameliorate the class imbalance in the SSPL prediction. We select the earthquake-induced landslides from the 2018 Hokkaido earthquake as a case study to evaluate our proposed method. First, six different datasets with 24 landslide influencing factors and 10,422 samples of a specific part of the landslides are established using remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. Then, based on each of the six datasets, four landslide susceptibility algorithms (XGB, LGB, random-forest (RF) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)) and four class balancing methods (non-balance (NB), equal-quantity sampling (EQS), inverse landslide-frequency weighting (ILW), and DCE loss) are applied to predict the SSPL. The results show that the non-balanced method underestimates landslide susceptibility, and the ILW or EQS methods overestimate the landslide susceptibility, while the DCE loss method produces more balanced results. The prediction performance of the XGBDCE (average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.970) surpasses that of RF (0.956), LGB (0.962), and LDA (0.921). Our proposed methods produce more unbiased and precise results than the existing models, and have a great potential to produce accurate general (e.g., predicting the entire landslide) and detailed (e.g., combining the prediction of the landslide source area with the landslide run-out modeling) landslide susceptibility assessments, which can be further applied to landslide hazard and risk assessments. © 2022 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs14235945,5,3,Yes,"XGB,LGBM,RF,LDA",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combined results of steps 1 and 2 produced a map of the road network vulnerability to landslides that demonstrated that 9.7 km (13.6%) of the road network was located in the very-high vulnerability class.

However, most of the evaluation methods ignore the dynamic characteristic factors of landslides, which makes it difficult to obtain reliable prediction results. Taking the upper reaches of the Jinsha River as the study area, this article introduces the deformation data into the landslide characteristic model and proposes an improved landslide susceptibility evaluation method. Four kinds of landslide susceptibility machine learning models were constructed by collecting 20 landslide related factors. The prediction accuracy of machine learning models is compared, and the performance of different models and the improvement of model performance by deformation information are evaluated. The results show that the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost model is better than SVM and logistic regression model. The prediction accuracy of Random Forest and XGBoost model is improved obviously after InSAR deformation is introduced. 96.9 and 93.19% of landslide areas were reasonably classified as high or very high risk levels. Compared with the calculation result of traditional model, the proportion of high and very high risk pixels in landslide area is increased by 2.97 and 1.13%, respectively.

The increased anthropogenic activities in weak geological areas have led to a rise in the frequency of landslides, making landslide management an urgent task to minimize the negative impact. This study aimed to use hyper-tuned machine learning and deep learning algorithms to predict landslide susceptibility model (LSM) and provide sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in Aqabat Al-Sulbat Asir region of Saudi Arabia. Methods: Random forest (RF) was used as the machine learning model, while deep neural network (DNN) was used as the deep learning model. The models were hyper-tuned using the grid search technique, and the best hypertuned models were used for predicting LSM. The generated models were validated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC), F1 and F2 scores, gini value, and precision and recall curve. The DNN based sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was conducted to analyze the influence and uncertainty of the parameters to the landslide. Results: Results showed that the RF and DNN models predicted 35.1–41.32 and 15.14–16.2 km2 areas as high and very high landslide susceptibility zones, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of ROC curve showed that the LSM by the DNN model achieved 0.96 of AUC, while the LSM by RF model achieved 0.93 of AUC. The sensitivity analysis results showed that rainfall had the highest sensitivity to the landslide, followed by Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), curvature, slope, soil texture, and lineament density. Discussion: Road density and geology map had the highest uncertainty to the landslide prediction.

Using artificial neural networks (ANN) to map these landslides is becoming more frequent every year, being one of the most reliable methods for this. Among the prime influences on the generated maps, sample areas are significantly interesting, since they directly influence the result. In this research, we investigated how the performance of these models is influenced by the use of partial sampling (with landslides caused by a single precipitation event–Single Model) or total (with landslides caused by multiple precipitation events–Full Model). This is one of the main topics that our study approaches. This study aims to evaluate the criteria for landslide sampling and ANN modeling by analyzing the influence of distance on the sampling processes, the use of multiple landslide events, and the relationship between terrain attributes and susceptibility models. To this end, were used five sampling areas (1638 points samples of landslides) in the Serra Geral, southern Brazil, distance buffers in the non-occurrence sampling process (2–40 km), and 16 terrain attributes. The training of the multilayer network was carried out by backpropagation algorithm, and the accuracy was calculated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. The results showed that the greater the distances of the non-occurring samples, the greater the accuracy of the model, with a 40 km buffer resulting in the best models. They also showed that the use of multiple events (Full Model) produced better results than each event used separately (Single Model), obtaining accuracies of 0.954 and 0.931, respectively. This is mainly because there is greater differentiation between occurrence and non-occurrence samples when using multiple events, thus facilitating the distinction between more and less susceptible areas. © 2022 The Author(s).

The application of deep learning technology to optical remote sensing images can help in the detection of landslide areas. Traditional landslide detection models usually have complex structural designs to ensure accuracy. However, this complexity leads to slow detection, and these models often do not satisfy the rapid response required for the emergency monitoring of landslides. Therefore, we designed a lightweight landslide target detection network based on a CenterNet and a ResNet50 network. We replaced the BottleNeck in the backbone network of ResNet50 with a Ghost-BottleNeck structure to reduce the number of parameters in the model. We also introduced an attention mechanism module based on channel attention and spatial attention between the adjacent GhostModule modules to rich the landslide features. We introduced a lightweight multiscale fusion method in the decoding process that presented a cross-layer sampling operation for the encoding process based on Feature Pyramid Network. To down-sample from a low resolution to a high resolution and up-sample from a high resolution to a low resolution, thus skipping the medium-resolution levels in the path. We added the feature maps obtained in the previous step to the feature fusion. The Conv module that adjusts the number of channels in the multiscale feature fusion operation was replaced with the GhostModule to achieve lightweight capability. At the end of the network, we introduced a state-of-the-art Yolov5x as a teacher network for feature-based knowledge distillation to further improve the accuracy of our student network. We used challenging datasets including multiple targets and multiscale landslides in the western mountains of Sichuan, China (e.g., Danba, Jiuzhaigou, Wenchuan, and Maoxian) to evaluate the proposed lightweight landslide detection network. The experimental results show that our model satisfied landslide emergency requirements in terms of both accuracy and speed; the parameter size of the proposed lightweight model is 18.7 MB, namely, 14.6% of the size of the original CenterNet containing the ResNet50 network.

ML techniques, including deep learning methods, are becoming popular to model complex landslide problems and are starting to demonstrate promising predictive performance compared to conventional methods. Almost all the studies published in the literature in recent years belong to one of the following three broad categories: landslide detection and mapping, landslide spatial forecasting in the form of susceptibility mapping, and landslide temporal forecasting. In this paper, we present a brief overview of ML techniques, provide a general summary of the landslide studies conducted, in recent years, in the three above-mentioned categories, and make an attempt to critically evaluate the use of ML methods to model landslide processes. The paper also provides suggestions for future use of these powerful data-driven techniques in landslide studies.

They can cause severe damage to both human lives and infrastructures. Although a huge quantity of research has been shaped to address rapid mapping of landslides by optical Earth Observation (EO) data, various gaps and uncertainties are still present when dealing with cloud obscuration and 24/7 operativity. To address the issue, we explore the usage of SAR data over the eastern Iburi sub-prefecture of Hokkaido, Japan. In the area, about 8000 co-seismic landslides were triggered by an Mw 6.6 earthquake on 6 September 2018, at 03.08 local time (JST). In the following study, we modify a Deep Learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture suited for pixel-based classification purposes, the so-called Attention U-Net (Attn-U-Net) and we employ it to evaluate the potential of bi-and tri-temporal SAR amplitude data from the Sentinel-1 satellite and slope angle to map landslides even under thick cloud cover. Four different datasets, composed of two different band combinations per two satellite orbits (ascending and descending) are analyzed. Moreover, the impact of augmentations is evaluated independently for each dataset. The modelsâ predictions are compared against an accurate landslide inventory obtained by manual mapping on pre-and post-event PlanetScope imagery through F1-score and other common metrics. The best result was yielded by the augmented ascending tri-temporal SAR composite image (61% F1-score). Augmentations have a positive impact on the ascending Sentinel-1 orbit, while metrics decrease when augmentations are applied on descending path. Our findings demonstrate that combining SAR data with other data sources may help to map landslides quickly, even during storms and under deep cloud cover. However, further investigations and improvements are still needed, this being one of the first attempts in which the combination of SAR data and DL algorithms are employed for landslide mapping purposes.

Several lives have been lost and substantial damage has been caused to livestock and property due to these landslides. Machine Learning algorithms have been used in several studies earlier for the creation of landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) for classification of regions prone to landslides. This study aims at creation of a LSM using the maximum likelihood (ML), ISO (International Organization for Standardization) clustering and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. The landslide conditioning factors (LCF) viz., slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, distance from stream, altitude and land use land change (LULC) have been analyzed in detail for the generation of the LSM. According to the results of this case study, the highest positive predicted value (PPV%) of 83% is observed for ISO algorithm with slope angle considered as LCF. The ISO algorithm with distance from stream LCF has the highest negative predicted value (NPV%) of 83%. The ISO algorithm with distance from stream LCF has the highest sensitivity of 84% and the ISO algorithm considering slope angle as LCF has the highest specificity of 84%. A Kappa index of 0.79 has been computed for ISO clustering using slope angle as LCF. It has also been observed that, of all the values of frequency ratio for the various classes of LCFs, slope angle gives the highest value of 3.4 for the class of 25 â 35 degrees.

In this regard, the accurate landslide susceptibility maps are very useful tool for decision-makers to identify areas where new landslides are likely to occur for planning timely adequate remedial measures. For the development of landslide susceptibility maps, seven hybrid models were developed namely AdaBoost-LMT (ABLMT), bagging-LMT (BLMT), cascade generalization-LMT (CGLMT), dagging-LMT (DLMT), MultiBoostAB-LMT (MBLMT), rotation forest-LMT (RFLMT) and random sub-space-LMT (RSSLMT) with logistic model trees (LMTs) as a base classifier.

Rapid landslide susceptibility assessments are indispensable and critical for risk analysis and emergency management. Previous studies mainly focus on the regional-scale assessment of EQIL susceptibility, while the global analyses of that are lacking. In this study, we constructed a global model for rapidly assessing earthquake-induced landslide susceptibility based on the random forest (RF) algorithm using globally available data. In total, 288,114 landslides from 16 high-quality EQIL inventories were utilized to develop the global landslide model. We split the data into 70% training dataset for model training and 30% testing data for model evaluation. We also used three blind test events to validate the model performance. The model showed excellent performance on the testing data (accuracy = 0.945, and AUC = 0.985). The RF model exhibited strong spatial generalizability and robustness, with an AUC exceeding 0.8 for each landslide inventory and showing good performance on the blind test events. The resulting landslide susceptibility maps also match relatively well with the actual landslide locations. Among the conditioning factors, modified Mercalli intensity (MMI), elevation and slope are the three most important conditioning factors. The susceptibility maps for each landslide event were produced. The developed RF model would be useful in studies of earthquake-induced landslide susceptibility and emergency response after an earthquake.

In this paper, chi-square (CS) and backward elimination (BE), which are well-known feature selection methods, were used for the optimum selection of input features/factors for training artificial neural network (ANN) for landslide susceptibility modeling. Initially, seventeen landslide affecting factors were considered for the ANN model which were reduced to twelve and eleven based on the ANN optimized by CS (CSANN) and BE (BEANN), respectively. Accuracy (ACC), Kappa Index, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve were used to evaluate and validate performance of the models. Results show that both the feature selection methods (CS and BE) improved significantly performance of the hybrid BEANN and CSANN models in comparison to single ANN model. Results indicated that performance of the BEANN model (AUROC 0.963; ACC 91.31) is the best in comparison to CSANN (AUROC 0.950; ACC 89.80) and ANN (AUROC 0.949; ACC 76.40) models in the accurate prediction of landslide susceptible areas/zones. Therefore, it is reasonable to state that the BE is more effective feature selection method than the CS in improving performance of the ANN model and thus, it can be used for better landslide susceptibility analysis for the landslide management of the area.

To predict landslide susceptibility for the study area, a spatial database consisted of 807 landslides and 11 conditioning factors has been prepared. Evaluation of conditioning factors was conducted using the Pearson correlation coefficient and Relief-F method. The results indicate that all factors except the topographic wetness index can be accepted as modeling inputs. Particularly, the distance to rivers is the most important factor in landslide susceptibility prediction. The performance of landslide models was evaluated using statistical indices and areas under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC).

The salt content of quick clay is strongly correlated to both its shear strength and electrical resistivity. Hence, it can be mapped using electromagnetic methods more efficiently than traditional intrusive methods, the latter of which can often be slow and costly. However, the resistivity signature of quick clay is non-unique, leading to ambiguous, imprecise interpretations of geophysical models. In this study, we present an improved method for predicting the probability of quick clay using airborne electromagnetics. Using machine learning algorithms, we combine geophysical models with geotechnical data to address the issue of their non-unique resistivity signature. Beyond resistivity values, the machine learning algorithms use spatial derivatives of resistivity and spatial attributes. We evaluate the performance of this method using data collected from a road construction project in central Norway. Results show that this method is able to make plausible and accurate predictions of quick clay occurrence using as few as 10 boreholes across an area of 14.8 km2, and that it outperforms a simple interpretation based on resistivity intervals alone. In addition to a âbest guessâ categorical classification, these algorithms output probability estimates, and we demonstrate that they are a reliable indication of uncertainty. The accuracy of these predictions also tends to increase as more geotechnical data are included as training data, helping compensate for the limited resolution of the airborne electromagnetics data. Given that the petrophysics of the clays at this test site are consistent with observations in other regions, we expect this method has the potential to make quick clay hazard mapping more efficient by offering valuable early-phase insights, leading to large time and cost savings for both infrastructure planning and regional hazard mapping.

Professional or trained technicians have to take much time and effort to interpret remote sensing images and locate landslides accordingly. Although conventional machine learning methods based on hand-crafted features for landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) have acquired remarkable performance, they have certain requirements for prior knowledge. Aiming to learn complex and inherent visual patterns of landslides through minimal manual intervention and achieve fine-grained prediction, in this paper, we define LSP as a semantic segmentation problem on optical remote sensing images. Six widely used semantic segmentation models including Fully Convolutional Network, U-Net, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network, Global Convolutional Network (GCN), DeepLab v3 and DeepLab v3+ are introduced and evaluated for LSP. As the lack of landslide datasets, an open labeled landslide dataset of remote sensing imagery is created for research. The results show that GCN and DeepLab v3 are more applicable for this problem scenario, and the best Mean Intersection-over-Union and Pixel Accuracy of models are 54.2% and 74.0% respectively, which could be further improved by more targeted network architectures. In conclusion, semantic segmentation methods are demonstrated to be effctive for predicting new potential landslides based on remote sensing images.

They lead to frequent landslide hazards, which cause serious threats to the safe operation of the power transmission system. Thus, it is of great significance to carry out landslide susceptibility assessment for disaster prevention and mitigation of power network. We, therefore, undertake an extensive analysis and comparison study between different data-driven methods using a case study from China. Several susceptibility mapping results were generated by applying a multivariate statistical method (logistic regression (LR)) and a machine learning technique (random forest (RF)) separately with two different mapping-units and predictor sets of differing configurations. The modelsâ accuracies, advantages and limitations are summarized and discussed using a range of evaluation criteria, including the confusion matrix, statistical indexes, and the estimation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The outcome showed that machine learning method is well suitable for the landslide susceptibility assessment along transmission network over grid cell units, and the accuracy of susceptibility models is evolving rapidly from statistical-based models toward machine learning techniques. However, the multivariate statistical logistic regression methods perform better when computed over heterogeneous slope terrain units, probably because the number of units is significantly reduced. Besides, the high model predictive performances cannot guarantee a high plausibility and applicability of subsequent landslide susceptibility maps. The selection of mapping unit can produce greater differences on the generated susceptibility maps than that resulting from the selection of modeling methods. The study also provided a practical example for landslide susceptibility assessment along the power transmission network and its potential application in hazard early warning, prevention, and mitigation.

The objective of this study is to suggest a new deterministic method based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. Eight crucial variables of LRA are selected with reference to expert opinions, and the output value is set to the safety factor derived by MohrâCoulomb failure theory in infinite slope. Linear regression and a neural network based on ML are applied to find the best model between independent and dependent variables. To increase the reliability of linear regression and the neural network, the results of back propagation, including gradient descent, LevenbergâMarquardt (LM), and Bayesian regularization (BR) methods, are compared. An 1800-item dataset is constructed through measured data and artificial data by using a geostatistical technique, which can provide the information of an unknown area based on measured data. The results of linear regression and the neural network show that the special LM and BR back propagation methods demonstrate a high determination of coefficient. The important variables are also investigated though random forest (RF) to overcome the number of various input variables. Only four variablesâshear strength, soil thickness, elastic modulus, and fine contentâdemonstrate a high reliability for LRA.

For landslide predictions, the probability distribution of precipitation in the representative concentration pathway scenario 8.5 was used. We accounted for future uncertainties by using several regional climate model scenarios. Comparing the performances of different ML algorithms, the overall prediction accuracy of the random forest (0.932) was excellent. Susceptibility to landslides in the future determined using the random forest and five other regional climate models exhibited minor differences, but the average susceptibility increased over time.

Three data mining models and their two-mode ensembles were selected as the basis of our experiment, namely, support vector machine (SVM), maximum entropy (MaxEnt), the ensemble of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and the imperialistic competitive algorithm (ANFIS-ICA), and their addition/multiplicity ensemble modes (WAE and WME). Further, we imitated four community groups and the main goals they aspire, namely, a speculative builder or a financial risk analyst (seeking the highest economic opportunities), people or NGOs (seeking the lowest human casualties and economic losses), the government (seeking a trade-off between the two latter goals), and a mechanical engineering supervisor (seeking the most robust and stable model design). Results revealed that, in contrast to some assumptions made by several researchers in different literature, the 70:30% partitioned training/validation samples would not give satisfactory results in our study area but, instead, 60:40% partition seems to be a good trade-off for the modelsâ learning and prediction powers. Moreover, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves suggested that the hybrid of ANFIS-ICA shows excellent results compared with its counterparts. Regarding the model selection stage at the optimal sample balance of 60:40%, it was conceived that although the WME model showed the lowest error type II (false negative) in both training and validation stages, it manifested the highest error type I (false positive) while other models placed somewhere in between. Conversely, the WAE outperformed other models in terms of the lowest error type I. Further, the robustness analysis suggested that SVM and MaxEnt models can provide more stable results compared with their counterparts. Hence, in the process of model selection, perspectives matter the most as there is no one model that performs best for every problem.

Hence, it is imperative to map the areas susceptible to landslides to minimize their risk. Around Abbottabad, a large city in northern Pakistan, a large number of landslides can be found. This study aimed to map the landslide susceptibility over these regions in Pakistan by using three Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Linear Regression (LiR), Logistic Regression (LoR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Several influencing factors were used to identify the potential landslide areas, including elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, general curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, landcover classification system, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil, lithology, fault density, topographic roughness index, and road density. The weights of these factors were calculated using ML techniques. The weightage overlay tool is adopted to map the final output. According to three ML models, lithology, NDWI, slope, and LCCS significantly impact landslide occurrence. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is applied to validate the performance of models, and the results show the AUC value of LiR (88%) is better than SVM (86%) and LoR (85%) models.

Recently proposed techniques in landslide detection generally focused on landslides in pure vegetation backgrounds and image radiometric correction. There are still challenges in regard to robust methods that automatically detect landslides from images with multiple platforms and without radiometric correction. It is a significant issue in practical application. In order to detect landslides from images over different large-scale areas with different spatial resolutions, this paper proposes a two-branch Matrix SegNet to semantically segment input images by change detection. The Matrix SegNet learns landslide features in multiple scales and aspect ratios. The pre- and post- event images are captured directly from Google Earth, without radiometric correction. To evaluate the proposed framework, we conducted landslide detection in four study areas with two different spatial resolutions. Moreover, two other widely used frameworks: U-Net and SegNet, were adapted to detect landslides via the same data by change detection. The experiments show that our model improves the performance largely in terms of recall, precision, F1-score, and IOU. It is a good starting point to develop a practical, deep learning landslide detection framework for large scale application, using images from different areas, with different spatial resolutions.

As a first step, a landslide inventory map was developed from various data sources. A total of 181 landslide points were identified and divided into 70% training and 30% validation datasets. Thirteen landslide indicator factors (LIFs) were used, including elevation, aspect, distance to fault, geology, land use, plan and profile curvature, distance to road, slope length (LS), stream power index (SPI), topographic witness index (TWI), slope angle, and distance to streams. Experimental results of model accuracy using receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve (ROC, AUC), mean absolute error (MAE), and kappa index (K) showed that the CNN-1D and CNN-2D models (ROC = 86% and 89%, respectively) were more accurate than conventional machine learning model (SVM) (ROC = 82%) in predicting landslides spatially. Specifically, the results showed that CNN-1D and CNN-2D were 4.9% and 7.9% better than support vector machine (SVM) in terms of ROC, and that CNN-2D was 3.5% better than CNN-1D.

This research work aims to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) by developing a deep multi-layer perceptron network named as DMLP-LSM and to demonstrate it over Srinagar-Rudraprayag region, a landslide prone region recognized by the Geological Survey of India (GSI). Initially, training datasets are generated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) enabled multi-criteria analysis, which involves information from various landslide causative factors. In a first, one dimensional line of sight (1D LOS) velocity, one of the critical inputs and prominent indicator for landslide susceptibility, is generated by processing 60 Sentinel-1A scenes using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) algorithm. The 1D LOS velocity map, generally used for quantitative monitoring slow moving landslides, is used here as a thematic layer. The thematic layers and LSMs were fed to the proposed DMLP-LSM network as input and output, respectively. The developed model reached an accuracy of 91.47% with precision, specificity and ROC_AUC score as 92.11%, 95.55% and 0.9072, respectively. It further identified nearly 15 square km area as susceptible to landslide. The efficacy of the proposed model is compared with two well-known machine learning models for LSM preparation, namely support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). In terms of accuracy, DMLP-LSM and RF had similar performance, but better than SVM. The velocity maps derived from MT-InSAR processing played a prominent role in the generation of LSM, supporting model training and performance.

To date, a large number of machine learning methods have been applied to LSM, and recently the advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) has been gradually adopted to enhance the prediction accuracy of LSM. The objective of this study is to introduce a CNN-based model in LSM and systematically compare its overall performance with the conventional machine learning models of random forest, logistic regression, and support vector ma-chine. Herein, we selected Zhangzha Town in Sichuan Province, China, and Lantau Island in Hong Kong, China, as the study areas. Each landslide inventory and corresponding predisposing factors were stacked to form spatial datasets for LSM. The receiver operating characteristic analysis, area under the curve (AUC), and several statistical metrics, such as accuracy, root mean square error, Kappa coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity, were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Finally, the trained models were calculated, and the landslide susceptibility zones were mapped. Results suggest that both CNN and conventional machine learning-based models have a satisfactory performance. The CNN-based model exhibits an excellent prediction capability and achieves the highest performance but also significantly reduces the salt-of-pepper effect, which indicates its great potential for application to LSM.

Wanzhou section of the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China, frequently suffering numerous landslides, is chosen as an example. The class-weighted algorithm focuses on the class-imbalanced issue of landslide and non-landslide samples, and it can turn the class-imbalanced issue into a cost-sensitive machine learning by setting unequal weights for different classes, which contribute to improving the accuracy of landslide susceptibility evaluation. The landslide inventory database was produced by field investigation and remote sensing images derived from Google Earth. Of the 233 landslides in the inventory, 40% were used for validation, and the remaining 60% were used for training purposes. Twelve environmental parameters (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, distance to river, NDVI, NDWI, rainfall, seismic intensity, land use, TRI, lithology) were treated as inputs of the models to produce a landslide susceptibility map (LSM). The AUC value, Balanced accuracy, and Geometric mean score were utilized to estimate the quality of models. The result shows that the weighted models (weighted logistic regression (WLR), weighted LightGBM (WLightGBM), weighted random forest (WRF) have higher AUC values, Balanced accuracy, and Geometric mean scores than those of unweighted methods, which demonstrates that the weighted models exhibit better than unweighted models, with the WRF model having the best performance. The landslide susceptibility map of the Wanzhou section displays that the high and very high landslide susceptibility zones are mainly distributed on both sides of the river.

Taking the Fenxi Coal Mine Area of Shanxi Province in China as the research area, landslide data has been investigated by the Shanxi Geological Environment Monitoring Center; adopting the 5-fold cross-validation method, and through Geostatistics analysis means the datasets of all non-landslides and landslides were divided into 80:20 proportions randomly for training and validating models. A set of 15 condition factors including terrain, geological, hydrological, land cover, and human engineering activity factors (distance to road, distance to mined area, ground collapse density) were selected as the evaluation indices to construct the susceptibility assessment model. Three machine learning algorithms for landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) including C5.0 Decision Tree (C5.0), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been selected and compared through the Areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves (AUC), and several statistical estimates. The study revealed that for these three models the value range of prediction accuracies vary from 83.49 to 99.29% (in the training stage), and 62.26â73.58% (in the validation stage). In the two stages, AUCs are between 0.92 to 0.99 and 0.71 to 0.80 respectively. Using Jenks Natural Breaks algorithm, three LSPs levels are established as very low, low, medium, high, and very high probability of landslide by dividing the indices of the LSP. Compared with RF and SVM, C5.0 is considered better in five categories according to quantities and distribution of the landslides and their area percentage for different LSP zones. Four factors such as distance to road, lithology, profile curvature, and ground collapse density are the most suitable condition factors for LSP. The distance to mine area factor has a medium contribution and plays an obvious role in the occurrence of landslides in all the models. The result reveals that C5.0 possesses better prediction efficiency than RF and SVM, and underground mined area and ground collapse sifnigicantly affect significantly the occurrence of landslides in the Fenxi Coal Mine Area.

Several factors can interfere in the performance of the models and their resulting maps (especially sampling). This research evaluated the influence of sampling areas on landslide susceptibility modelling and the capacity for generalization and spatial extrapolation of data. Based on an inventory of landslide scars, distributed in five areas of southern Brazil, non-occurrence samples were defined by means of different buffers (2â40 km) in relation to the landslides in order to test the effect of the spatial distribution of the non-occurrence samples on the modeling results. A total of 16 morphometric attributes of the terrain (extracted from a digital elevation model) were used as input variables of the model. Multilayered network training was carried out using a backpropagation algorithm and accuracy was calculated by means of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). Model accuracy was between 0.739 and 0.931. This variation was explained mainly by the buffer used. The susceptibility map resulting from the model of greater accuracy was obtained with a 40-km buffer in order to collect non-occurrence samples. The great distance between the occurrence and non-occurrence samples facilitates the modelling, since it increases the morphometric differences between the sampling groups. When we used samples from only one of the sample areas, the spatial extrapolation of the susceptibility map to the other areas showed high performance. We conclude that the ANN model for landslides susceptibility mapping can be extrapolated spatially, considering the limits of the geomorphological unit or numerical domain of the data.

The landslide occurrences were first divided into training and testing datasets with a 70/30 ratio. Fourteen landslide-related factors were considered, and the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) were employed to determine the correlation between landslides and factors. After that, the hybrid models of ANFIS-HHO, ANFIS-BA, SVR-HHO and SVR-BA were applied to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs). Finally, in order to validation and comparison of the applied models, two indexes, namely mean square error (MSE) and area under the ROC curve (AUROC), were used. According to the validation results, the AUROC values for the ANFIS-HHO, ANFIS-BA, SVR-HHO and SVR-BA were 0.849, 0.82, 0.895, and 0.865, respectively. The SVR-HHO showed the highest accuracy, with AUROC of 0.895 and lowest MSE of 0.147, and ANFIS-BA showed the least accuracy with an AUROC value of 0.82 and MSE value of 0.218. Based on the results, although four hybrid models with more than 80% accuracy can generate very good results, the SVR is superior to the ANFIS model, whereas the HHO algorithm outperformed the bat algorithm.

The common practice in optimising landslide prediction models is to search for optimal/suboptimal hyperparameter values in a number of predetermined hyperparameter configurations based on an objective function, i.e., k-fold cross-validation accuracy. However, the overhead of hyperparameter optimisation can be prohibitive, especially for computationally expensive algorithms. This paper introduces an optimisation approach based on meta-learning for the spatial prediction of landslides. The proposed approach is tested in a dense tropical forested area of Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. Instead of optimising prediction models with a large number of hyperparameter configurations, the proposed approach begins with promising configurations based on several basic and statistical meta-features. The proposed meta-learning approach was tested based on Bayesian optimisation as a hyperparameter tuning algorithm and random forest (RF) as a prediction model. The spatial database was established with a total of 63 historical landslides and 15 conditioning factors. Three RF models were constructed based on (1) default parameters as suggested by the sklearn library, (2) parameters suggested by the Bayesian optimisation (BO), and (3) parameters suggested by the proposed meta-learning approach (BO-ML). Based on five-fold cross-validation accuracy, the Bayesian method achieved the best performance for both the training (0.810) and test (0.802) datasets. The meta-learning approach achieved slightly lower accuracies than the Bayesian method for the training (0.769) and test (0.800) datasets. Similarly, based on F1-score and area under the receiving operating characteristic curves (AUROC), the models with optimised parameters either by the Bayesian or meta-learning methods produced more accurate landslide susceptibility assessment than the model with the default parameters. In the present approach, instead of learning from scratch, the meta-learning would begin with hyperparameter configurations optimal for the most similar previous datasets, which can be considerably helpful and time-saving for landslide modelings.

An initial dataset of 36 variables was compiled to investigate the connection between slope morphology and landslide occurrence. Bagged trees, a machine-learning random-forest classifier, was used to evaluate the geomorphic variables, and 12 were identified as important: standard deviation of plan curvature, standard deviation of elevation, sum of plan curvature, minimum slope, mean plan curvature, range of elevation, sum of roughness, mean curvature, sum of curvature, mean roughness, minimum curvature and standard deviation of curvature. These variables were further evaluated using logistic regression to determine the probability of landslide occurrence and then used to create a landslide-susceptibility map. The performance of the logistic-regression model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve, which was 0.83. Standard deviations from the probability mean were used to set landslide-susceptibility classifications: low (0â0.10), lowâmoderate (0.11â0.27), moderate (0.28â0.44), moderateâhigh (0.45â0.61) and high (0.62â1.0).

Accurate and timely delineation of flood inundated areas is essential for disaster assessment and mitigation. There have been significant advances in flood mapping using remote sensing images in recent years, but little attention has been devoted to outburst flood mapping. The short?duration nature of these events and observation constraints from cloud cover have significantly challenged outburst flood mapping. This study used the outburst flood of the Baige landslide dam on the Jinsha River on 3 November 2018 as an example to propose a new flood mapping method that combines optical images from Sentinel?2, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Sentinel?1 and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). First, in the cloud?free region, a comparison of four spectral indexes calculated from time series of Sentinel?2 images indicated that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the threshold of 0.15 provided the best separation flooded area. Subsequently, in the cloud?covered region, an analysis of dualpolarization RGB false color composites images and backscattering coefficient differences of Sentinel?1 SAR data were found an apparent response to ground roughnessâs changes caused by the flood. We carried out the flood range prediction model based on the random forest algorithm. Training samples consisted of 13 feature vectors obtained from the Hue?Saturation?Value color space, backscattering coefficient differences/ratio, DEM data, and a label set from the flood range prepared from Sentinel?2 images. Finally, a field investigation and confusion matrix tested the prediction accuracy of the end?of?flood map. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 92.3%, 0.89 respectively. The full extent of the outburst floods was successfully obtained within five days of its occurrence. The multi?source data merging framework and the massive sample preparation method with SAR images proposed in this paper, provide a practical demonstration for similar machine learning applications using remote sensing.

This study evaluates the effect of spatial resolution and data splitting, using five different ML algorithms (naÃ¯ve bayes (NB), K nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM)). The maps were developed using twelve landslide conditioning factors at two different resolutions, 12.5 m and 30 m. To identify the effect of data splitting on model performance, 2162 landslide points and an equal number of non-landslide points were used for training and testing the models using k-fold cross-validation, by varying the number of folds from two to ten. Results indicated that the spatial resolution of the dataset affects the performance of all the algorithms considered, while the effect of data splitting is significant in KNN and RF algorithms. All the algorithms yielded better performance while using the dataset with 12.5 m resolution for the same number of folds. It was also observed that the accuracy and area-under-the-curve values of 7, 8, 9, and 10-fold cross-validations with 30 m resolution was better than 2 and 3-fold cross-validations using 12.5 m resolution, in the case of RF algorithm.

The investigation was carried out to ascertain the effectiveness of NaÃ¯ve Bayes Multinomial (NBM) and Random Trees (RT) in landslide susceptibility mapping. The NBM is an advancement of the frequently used NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifiers, while the RT was built to overcome the limitations of the traditional forest classifiers. A geospatial database for this investigation comprises 148 landslide locations influenced by ten (10) landslide conditioning factors. The factors (Slope Angle, Slopes Elevation, Slope Aspect, Plan curvature, Profile Curvature, Lithology, Soil type, Stream power index (SPI), Sediment transport index (STI), and Rainfall precipitation) were drawn using a Multi Collinearity Decision Making (MCDM) technique. A Frequency Ratio (FR) analysis was used to obtain the relative significance of the factors in the slides. Predictive models were also developed by quantifying these models using data mining techniques. A section of the entire geospatial data (70%) was used as training datasets, while the remaining part of the data (30%) was used to validate the trained datasets. SVM, RT, and NBM algorithms were used to produce predicted datasets from the training datasets. These predicted datasets were used to develop the Landslides Susceptibility Models. A comparative assessment between the two classifiers against the famous traditional learning algorithm, the Support vector machines (SVM), was conducted. Model performance evaluators such as the AUROC, RSME, F-measure, MAE, and ACC were employed to check the predictive capabilities and accuracies of the models. The indices indicated that the SVM model performed better than the other two algorithms in both training and validation datasets. Further analysis and comparison of the models reveal that the new data mining techniques are reliable for landslide susceptibility. Simultaneously, the traditional algorithm is also useful and remains relevant, especially with similar site conditions. This study has provided insights on better planning and development and provision of mitigation strategies and further analysis on landslides in the study area, particularly in cases of limited data availability.

The purpose of this research is to establish a coupled landslide warning model based on random forest susceptibility zoning and precipitation. The 1520 landslide events in Fengjie County, Chongqing, China, before 2016 are taken as research cases. We adapt the random forest model to build a landslide susceptibility model. The antecedent effective precipitation model, based on the fractal rela-tionship, is used to calculate the antecedent effective precipitation in the 10 days before the landslide event. Based on different susceptibility zones, the effective precipitation corresponding to different cumulative frequencies is counted as the threshold, and the threshold is adjusted according to the fitted curve. Finally, according to the daily precipitation, the rain warning levels in susceptibility zones are further adjusted, and the final prewarning model of the susceptibility zoning and precipitation coupling is obtained. The results show that the random forest model has good prediction ability for landslide susceptibility zoning, and the precipitation warning model that couples landslide susceptibility, antecedent effective precipitation, and the daily precipitation threshold has high early warning ability. At the same time, it was found that the precipitation warning model coupled with antecedent effective precipitation and the daily precipitation threshold has more accurate precipitation warning ability than the precipitation warning model coupled with the antecedent effective precipitation only; the coupling of the two can complement each other to better characterize the occurrence of landslides triggered by rainfall. The proposed coupled landslide early warning model based on random forest susceptibility and rainfall inducing factors can provide scientific guidance for landslide early warning and prediction, and improve the manageability of landslide risk.

The unique and fragile ecosystem in the Yangtze Riverâs Three Gorges Reservoir region is prone to natural disasters, including soil erosion, landslides, debris flows, landslides, and earthquakes. Therefore, to better alleviate these threats, an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the susceptibility of this area is required. In this study, based on the collection of relevant data and existing research results, we applied machine learning models, including logistic regression (LR), the random forest model (RF), and the support vector machine (SVM) model, to analyze landslide susceptibility in the Yangtze Riverâs Three Gorges Reservoir region to analyze landslide events in the whole study region. The models identified five categories (i.e., topographic, geological, ecological, meteorological, and human engineering activities), with nine independent variables, influencing landslide susceptibility. The accuracy of landslide susceptibility derived from different models and raster cells was then verified by the accuracy, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC of each model. The results illustrate that the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms is ranked as SVM > RF > LR. The LR model has the lowest generalization ability. The SVM model performs well in all regions of the study area, with an AUC value of 0.9708 for the entire Three Gorges Reservoir area, indicating that the SVM model possesses a strong spatial generalization ability as well as the highest robustness and can be adapted as a real-time model for assessing regional landslide susceptibility.

However, the internal structures of such algorithms contain a set of hyperparameter configurations whose correct setting is crucial to get the highest achievable performance.

Five accuracy metrics, including overall accuracy (OA), precision, recall, F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and a statistical significance test were employed to measure the effectiveness of the optimization strategies on XGBoost algorithm. Compared to the XGBoost model with default setting, the optimized models provided a significant improvement of up to 13% in terms of overall accuracy, which was also ascertained by McNemarâs test. AUC analysis revealed that having statistically similar performances, GA (0.942) and Hyperband (0.922) methods had the highest predictive abilities, followed by BO-GP (0.920), BO-TPE (0.899), and RS (0.894). Analysis of computational cost efficiency showed that the Hyperband approach (40.3Â s) was much faster (about 13 times) than the GA in hyperparameter tuning, and thus appeared to be the best optimization algorithm for the problem under consideration.

The primary objectives of this study are to explore the influence of the traditional buffer-controlled sampling method on model performance and to propose a Newmark-based sampling approach for coseismic landslides. The Jiuzhaigou meizoseismal region of China is selected as the region of study. Six sample datasets are constructed for three machine learning models, namely a deep neural network (DNN), logistic regression (LR), and a support vector machine (SVM). The samples cover two scenarios: scenario-BZ, a set of samples created using different buffer distances, and scenario-LD, a set of non-landslide samples created by the Newmark-based method. Intriguingly, the results indicate that the area under the curve (AUC) is positively correlated with the buffer distance in scenario-BZ (DNN: 0.894â0.979, SVM: 0.894â0.981, LR: 0.797â0.889), but gentle valleys in the buffer zone are assigned over-conservative susceptibility values while the probability of landslides in steep mountains outside the buffer zone is underestimated. In contrast, all models assign more reasonable susceptibility values in scenario-LD (AUC values of 0.969, 0.969, and 0.931 for the DNN, LR, and SVM models, respectively). These results suggest that the landslide susceptibility obtained by the traditional buffer-controlled method may be inaccurate, despite the prediction model achieving excellent performance. The proposed approach can therefore provide insights into coseismic landslide susceptibility in other earthquake regions.

The landslides caused by the 2005 Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These machine learning models are innovative and can assess environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI, Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5%), 0.893 (89.3%), and 0.790 (79.0%), respectively. Based on the three machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895, and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers. Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and infrastructural areas.

The efficient and automatic multi-scale segmentation (MSS) method proposed by the authors promotes the application of slope units. However, LSP modeling based on these slope units has not been performed. Moreover, the heterogeneity of conditioning factors in slope units is neglected, leading to incomplete input variables of LSP modeling. In this study, the slope units extracted by the MSS method are used to construct LSP modeling, and the heterogeneity of conditioning factors is represented by the internal variations of conditioning factors within slope unit using the descriptive statistics features of mean, standard deviation and range. Thus, slope units-based machine learning models considering internal variations of conditioning factors (variant slope-machine learning) are proposed. The Chongyi County is selected as the case study and is divided into 53,055 slope units. Fifteen original slope unit-based conditioning factors are expanded to 38 slope unit-based conditioning factors through considering their internal variations. Random forest (RF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) machine learning models are used to construct variant Slope-RF and Slope-MLP models. Meanwhile, the Slope-RF and Slope-MLP models without considering the internal variations of conditioning factors, and conventional grid units-based machine learning (Grid-RF and MLP) models are built for comparisons through the LSP performance assessments. Results show that the variant Slope-machine learning models have higher LSP performances than Slope-machine learning models; LSP results of variant Slope-machine learning models have stronger directivity and practical application than Grid-machine learning models. It is concluded that slope units extracted by MSS method can be appropriate for LSP modeling, and the heterogeneity of conditioning factors within slope units can more comprehensively reflect the relationships between conditioning factors and landslides.

Despite enormous efforts in developing intelligent landslide mapping (LM) approaches, LM remains challenging ow-ing to high spectral heterogeneity of very?high?resolution (VHR) images and the daunting labeling efforts. To this end, a deep learning model based on semi?supervised multi?temporal deep representation fusion network, namely SMDRF?Net, is proposed for reliable and efficient LM. In comparison with previous methods, the SMDRF?Net possesses three distinct properties. 1) Unsupervised deep representation learning at the pixel? and object?level is performed by transfer learning using the Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty to learn discriminative deep features and retain precise outlines of landslide objects in the high?level feature space. 2) At-tention?based adaptive fusion of multi?temporal and multi?level deep representations is developed to exploit the spatio?temporal dependencies of deep representations and enhance the feature representation capability of the network. 3) The network is optimized using limited samples with pseudo?labels that are automatically generated based on a comprehensive uncertainty index.

This research aimed to construct four optimized ensemble machine learning algorithms for landslide susceptibility (LS) mapping, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) based artificial neural network (ANN), random forest, M5P, and support vector machine. The logistic regression (LR) model was then applied to the four-ensemble machine learning model and generated a hybrid optimized machine learning model. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was then used to validate LS map. The best model of four LS models depending on ROC's area under curve (AUC) is PSO-ANN (AUC-0.958) model. Also, LR model-based hybrid ensemble machine learning model achieved better accuracy (AUC: 0.962) than PSO-ANN model. Various resources, viz. grassland, built-up, and scarce foliage, are declared as landslide risk zones. Finally, elevation, soil-texture, slope, rainfall, and road distance are considered the most sensitive parameters for landslide occurrences.

Model selection depends on both the reliability and accuracy of model results, therefore comprehensively evaluating the performance of a model is necessary. Previous studies of landslide susceptibility focused more on the prediction accuracy of a model. However, model stability and model sensitivity to data volume also reflect important model performances in different aspects. In this study, we employed Back-Propagation (BP) artificial neural network and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model for model performance comparison in landslide susceptibility prediction. We evaluated model performance from three aspects: Data sensitivity, prediction accuracy, and model stability. The Caiyuan basin in Fujian Province was taken as the study area and 11 landslide-related factors were selected. Additionally, Beichuan county in Sichuan Province was taken as the verification area and 12 landslide-related factors selected. Firstly, two models were both trained using different amounts of data as input. With increasing data volume, the prediction accuracy of BP artificial neural network increased faster than that of CART model. Specifically, in Caiyuan basin, the prediction accuracy of BP artificial neural network and CART decision tree model increased by 5.22% and 2.11%, respectively, for every additional 10 000 samples. In Beichuan county, the prediction accuracy of these two models increased by 4.88% and 3.40%, respectively. Secondly, 100 sets of training data and validation data generated by random sampling were fed into two models for training. The experimental results show that, for Caiyuan basin, the mean prediction accuracy was 81.60% and 72.97% for BP artificial neural network and CART model, respectively, and the standard deviation was 0.32% and 0.35% for BP and CART, respectively. For Beichuan county, the mean prediction accuracy of two models was 77.45% and 72.61%, respectively, and the standard deviation was 0.47% and 0.61%, respectively. Finally, landslide susceptibility maps were generated based on two models. Compared to real landslide spatial distribution map, the result of BP artificial neural network was more consistent with the actual landslide distributions. In general, our study demonstrates that BP artificial neural network is more sensitive to the increase of data volume and has better model stability and prediction accuracy than CART model. But it is worth noting that the performance of two models is close with small data volume. The study provides a new perspective of model selection for landslide susceptibility analysis.

Natural causes for the occurrence of soil erosion are steep topography and prevailing climate conditions in combination with soil fragility. To increase our understanding of ongoing erosion processes and support sustainable land-use management, there is a need to acquire detailed information on spatial occurrence and temporal trends. Existing approaches to identify these trends are typically laborious, have lack of transferability to other regions, and are consequently only applicable to smaller regions. In order to overcome these limitations and create a sophisticated erosion monitoring tool capable of large-scale analysis, we developed a model based on U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network, to map different erosion processes on high-resolution aerial images (RGB, 0.25â0.5 m). U-Net was trained on a high-quality data set consisting of labeled erosion sites mapped with object-based image analysis (OBIA) for the Urseren Valley (Central Swiss Alps) for five aerial images (16 year period). We used the U-Net model to map the same study area and conduct quality assessments based on a held-out test region and a temporal transferability test on new images. Erosion classes are assigned according to their type (shallow landslide and sites with reduced vegetation affected by sheet erosion) or land-use impacts (livestock trails and larger management affected areas). We show that results obtained by OBIA and U-Net follow similar linear trends for the 16 year study period, exhibiting increases in total degraded area of 167% and 201%, respectively. Segmentations of eroded sites are generally in good agreement, but also display method-specific differences, which lead to an overall precision of 73%, a recall of 84%, and a F1-score of 78%. Our results show that U-Net is transferable to spatially (within our study area) and temporally unseen data (data from new years) and is therefore a method suitable to efficiently and successfully capture the temporal trends and spatial heterogeneity of degradation in alpine grasslands. Additionally, U-Net is a powerful and robust tool to map erosion sites in a predictive manner utilising large amounts of new aerial imagery. Â© 2020 by the authors.

To study the effects of the two uncertain factors on the change rules of LSP, taking Shangyou County of Jiangxi Province, China, as study area, the AIN values of the continuous environmental factors are respectively set to be 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20. Meanwhile, five different data-based models (analytic hierarchy process (AHP), logistic regression (LR), BP neural network (BPNN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF)) are selected as LSP models. Hence, there are a total of 25 types of different calculation conditions for LSP. Finally, the accuracy and uncertainties of LSP are analyzed. The results show that: (1) For a certain model, the LSP accuracy gradually increases with the AIN value increasing from 4 to 8, then slowly increases to a stable level with AIN increasing from 8 to 20; (2) For a certain AIN, the LSP accuracy of the RF model is higher than SVM, followed by the BPNN, LR and AHP models; (3) Under all the 25 calculation conditions, the prediction accuracy of AIN=20 and RF model is the highest while that of AIN=4 and AHP model is the lowest, and the modeling efficiency and accuracy of AIN=8 and RF model are very high;(4) The landslide susceptibility indexes calculated by the higher AIN and more advanced machine learning models are more consistent with the actual distribution features of landslide probability and have relatively lower uncertainties. It can be concluded that an efficient and relatively accurate LSP model can be built under the condition of AIN value of 8 and RF model. Â© 2020, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

Landslide susceptibility assessment is the key technique of landslide monitoring and early warning. In view of the limited data sources of traditional landslide monitoring methods and the lack of effective methods for mining the spatial distribution of landslide hazards and their inducing factors, the main objectives of this study was to investigate the prediction performances of synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for landslide susceptibility assessment in the Wanzhou area of the Three Gorges, China.Methods: The landslide susceptibility assessment methods used in this paper are SMOTE and CNN. SMOTE is an improved random oversampling algorithm, which was used to better the imbalance of input samples. CNN is a widely used deep learning network and differs from other neural networks mainly in convolution operation. CNN was used to analyze the nonlinear relationship between landslides and its influen- cing factors. Firstly, 22 influencing factors were extracted from multi-source data such as topographic, geological, and remote sensing data, and multicollinearity test was performed on these factors. Then, the grid unit with a spatial resolution of 25 m was selected as the mapping unit. 30% of the initial sample dataset was selected randomly for testing of the CNN, and the remaining 70% was expanded by using SMOTE to obtain 1: 1 landslide and non-landslide dataset. 90% of the proportionally balanced dataset was randomly selected as the training set and the remaining 10% as the validation set. Thirdly, the obtained training sample set is input to the CNN and six optimal model parameters were set to ensure the stability and efficiency of the model. Finally, the trained CNN was used to generate landslide susceptibility zoning map, and the receiver operating characteristic curves, testing and validating set were used for evaluating the accuracy and results of the proposed model.Results: The proposed SMOTE-CNN model with the highest predictive accuracy and generalization ability was trained and then used to calculate the landslide susceptibility indices. The index values of the grid cells vary from zero to one and correspond to landslide susceptibilities from low to high. The landslide susceptibility maps were created using these values. For easy visual interpretation, the susceptibility values were classified into five classes (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high) using Jenks natural breaks. Approximately, 59.57 % of the landslides lie in the very-high-susceptibility region, 18.74% of the landslides lie in the high-susceptibility region, 10.73% of the landslides lie in the moderate- susceptibility region, and 10.96 % of the landslides lie in the low- and very-low-susceptibility regions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model provides the best predictive accuracy. The model can effectively assess landslide susceptibility and provides a novel method for landslide prediction.Conclusions: The SMOTE and CNN were applied to quantitatively mapping the landslide susceptibility in Wanzhou area of the Three Gorges, China. The experimental results show that SMOTE and CNN have good stability, and the results were consistent with field investigations and can provide a reference for landslide prevention and reduction in the Three Gorge, China. In addition, CNN has the characteristics of strong adaptability and is good at mining local features of data and extracting global training features and classification. However, the physical meaning of CNN model is not clear, and it takes a long time to process a large amount of data, so it relies on GPU acceleration. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out further research from the aspects of super-parameter optimization combination, model structure adjustment, applicability analysis etc., so as to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.

In this framework, anomalies of movement, i.e., accelerations or deceleration as seen by the time series of displacement of radar targets, are identified. In this work, a Machine Learning algorithm such as the Random Forest has been used to assess the probability of occurrence of the anomalies induced by slope instability and subsidence. About 20,000 anomalies (about 7000 and 13,000 for the slope instability and the subsidence, respectively) were collected between 2018 and 2020 and were used as input, while ten different variables were selected, five related to the morphological and geological setting of the study area and five to the radar characteristics of the data. The resulting maps may provide useful indications of where a sudden change of displacement trend may occur, analyzing the contribution of each factor. The cross-validation with the anomalies collected in a following timespan (2020-2021) and with official landslide and subsidence inventories provided by the regional authority has confirmed the reliability of the final maps.

Taking advantage of spectral and spatial enhancement in Landsat OLI images, a machine learning based kNN algorithm was applied to derive AGB maps of a pristine forest of Pinus kesiya in 2014 and 2019 via allometric models of the pine and inventory data. AGB productivity of the study site was derived and examined for diagnosing the pristine pine forest development. The radiance of the Landsat image was first restored and then normalized by the FLAASH model, a radiation transfer model-based algorithm used to derive surface reflectance image, and finally a pansharpening technique was applied to improve the spatial resolution while retaining the spectral resolution of the reflectance image. Results showed that the pansharpened surface reflectance image was able to derive AGB maps with a satisfactory accuracy of root mean square percentage error, RMSPE = 15%, which shows significant improvement on the performance of AGB estimation using the raw image (RMSPE = 56%) and non-pansharpened surface reflectance image (RMSPE = 48%). The loss of AGB stocks is mainly caused by landslide, forest fire, and agricultural expansion, particularly the use of fire for land preparation for cropping. Land covers other than pine stands have complicated the edge of the pristine pine forest. The non-forest cover types surrounded the forest enlarged the boundary of the forest and made the pristine forest slightly fragmented. The results also showed that the AGB loss/gain of a forest parcel is negatively/positively related to the size of the parcel.

The earthquake initiated a series of catastrophic landslides (classified as flowslides) [1,2], collapsed buildings, and generated tsunami waves that impacted Palu Bay's coast. The earthquake claimed over 40 00 lives, making it the deadliest natural disaster of 2018.

The GEER team arrived at Palu City on 13 November 2018 and conducted five days of extensive fieldwork using instrumentation from the Natural Hazards Reconnaissance Facility (known as the ""RAPID"") [4,5], including mobile data collection software, digital imaging systems, high-resolution Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antennas, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or "";drones""). The resulting dataset includes over 20 00 geotagged photographs, UAV images, ground coordinates, and other field measurements and observations, as well as associated post-processed geospatial data products (point clouds, digital surface models, orthomosaic images). Additionally, we used remote sensing data (i.e., preand post-event satellite imagery) to generate displacement vectors for over 1200 structures affected by the flowslides. The complete reconnaissance dataset is openly available on DesignSafe [6]. The data collected by the field team and subsequent mapping efforts, which document the morphology and patterns of movements of the flowslides, may be used by researchers studying liquefaction-induced flowslides.

To face this issue, the research community has been starting to test new methodological approaches and tools, including the application of Machine Learning (ML) leveraging the potential of the large availability and variety of spatio-temporal big data for environmental applications. Given the increasing attention on the application of ML methods to Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), this review mapped out the state of art and potential of these methods to this field of research. Scientometric and systematic analysis were jointly applied providing an in-depth review of publications across the 2000-2020 timeframe. The resulting output from the analysis showed that a huge variety of ML algorithms have been already applied within CCRA, among them, the most recurrent are Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. These algorithms are often applied in an ensemble or hybridized way to analyze most of all floods and landslides risk events. Moreover, the application of ML to deal with remote sensing data is consistent and effective across reviewed CCRA applications, allowing the identification and classification of targets and the detection of environmental and structural features. On the contrary concerning future climate change scenarios, literature seems not to be very widespread into scientific production, compared to studies evaluating risks under current conditions. The same lack can be noted also for the assessment of cascading and compound hazards and risks, since these concepts are recently emerging in CCRA literature but not yet in combination with ML-based applications.",EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103752,4,2,No,,,"Italy,Turkey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ngororero, Rubavu, Nyabihu, and Karongi were the worst-hit areas, as reported by Rwanda Broadcasting Agency (RBA). Such recurring disasters have posed significant challenges to the affected communities, requiring strong measures like susceptibility mapping to address their impact in the future. The literature review indicates that statistic and machine-learning susceptibility mapping efforts have been applied in the study region. However, these studies have not focused explicitly on localized scale studies of the western province; instead, they have mainly concentrated on examining the entire country. Using artificial neural networks (ANN), Shannon entropy (SE), and frequency ratio (FR), this paper aims to fill some gaps in the Rwandan landslide literature by integrating localized studies of the landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) of the western province of Rwanda using the available higher data resolution. The LSM studies took 1157 landslide inventory locations and considered a broader range of landslide-conditioning factors compared to the previous studies on the region (distance from the road, aspect, elevation, slope degree, stream power index, normalized differential vegetation index, plan curvature, distance from the river, topographic wetness index, geology, and rainfall). In model training, 70% (810 points) of the landslide points underwent utilization, while the remaining 30% (347 points) served the purpose of model testing. The obtained area under the curve (AUC) values from model validation and testing provided reliable accuracy measures for the three LSM methods: ANN (AUC = 0.929 and 0.924), FR (AUC = 0.895 and 0.889), and SE (AUC = 0.768 and 0.750). Despite varying data handling, the models show that Rutsiro, Ngororero, and Karongi in Rwanda's Western Province have the highest landslide concentration. The relative importance of conditioning factors indicates that geology, rainfall, distance to the road, slope, and NDVI factors played a crucial role in landslides in the studied area. The slope can be stabilized by enhancing drainage, modifying slope angles, and implementing structural fortifications. It is hoped that the findings of this study will aid Rwandan policymakers and global researchers mitigate landslides and their dynamics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Earth Sciences,10.1007/s12665-023-11134-4,2,2,Yes,"ANN,FR,SR",,"Germany,Nigeria,United States,Saudi Arabia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the great progress achieved in applying optimized and hybrid methods, it is necessary to use them to increase the accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps. Therefore, this research aims to compare the accuracy of the novel evolutionary methods of landslide susceptibility mapping. To achieve this, a unique method that integrates two techniques from Machine Learning and Neural Networks with novel geomorphological indices is used to calculate the landslide susceptibility index (LSI). The study was conducted in western Azerbaijan, Iran, where landslides are frequent. Sixteen geology, environment, and geomorphology factors were evaluated, and 160 landslide events were analyzed, with a 30:70 ratio of testing to training data. Four Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-MLP were tested. The study outcomes reveal that utilizing the algorithms mentioned above results in over 80% of the study area being highly sensitive to large-scale movement events. Our analysis shows that the geological parameters, slope, elevation, and rainfall all play a significant role in the occurrence of landslides in this study area. These factors obtained 100%, 75.7%, 68%, and 66.3%, respectively. The predictive performance accuracy of the models, including SVM, ANN, and ROC algorithms, was evaluated using the test and train data. The AUC for ANN and each machine learning algorithm (Simple, Kernel, Kernel Gaussian, and Kernel Sigmoid) was 0.87% and 1, respectively. The Classification Matrix algorithm and Sensitivity, Accuracy, and Specificity variables were used to assess the models' efficacy for prediction purposes. Results indicate that machine learning algorithms are more effective than other methods for evaluating areas' sensitivity to landslide hazards. The Simple SVM and Kernel Sigmoid algorithms performed well, with a performance score of one, indicating high accuracy in predicting landslide-prone areas. © 2023.

We used the data from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal to assess adequacy of various machine learning models and segregated the importance of various landslide conditioning factors in this study. We used five supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extremely Randomized Trees Classifier (ET) to predict earthquake-induced landslide susceptibility. Due to the Gorkha earthquake and its aftershocks, around 25,000 landslides were triggered, among them 23,217 were located within the study area. Using landslide polygons, 23,217 landslide points, and 23,213 randomly selected non-landslide points were generated. The data was randomly divided into 70:30 ratio to create training and testing data sets for model training and evaluation. Results of the SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and factor importance analysis using ET infer that the first five crucial factors governing earthquake induced landslides are topographic ruggedness index, slope, distance to fault, peak ground acceleration, and distance to rupture. We evaluated the ML models by comparing their performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Kappa value, and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC). The results indicated that the accuracy varies between 86.60% for ET to 74.40% for LR. The area under the ROC curve for five machine learning algorithms occurs between 0.866 and 0.744 for actual label prediction and 0.935 to 0.819 for probabilistic prediction. Based on the comparative performance assessment, ET is designated to predict earthquake induced landslides more efficiently than the other ML algorithms. The sum of the results highlights that ensemble learning outperforms other ML based classifiers to assess earthquake induced landslide susceptibility. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering,10.1016/j.soildyn.2023.107994,2,2,No,,,"Nepal,Iceland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is a proven way for minimizing the hazard and risk of landslides. Modeling as an essential step, various algorithms have been applied to LSM, but no consensus exists on which model is most suitable or best. In this study, information value (IV) and logistic regression (LR) were selected as representatives of the conventional algorithms, categorical boosting (CatBoost), and conventional neural networks (CNN) as the advanced algorithms, for LSM in Yadong County, and their performance was compared. To begin with, 496 historical landslide events were compiled into a landslide inventory map, followed by a list of 11 conditioning factors, forming a data set. Secondly, the data set was randomly divided into two parts, 80% of which was used for modeling and 20% for validation. Finally, the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical metrics were applied to validate and compare the performance of the models. The results showed that the CNN model performed the best (sensitivity = 79.38%, specificity = 91.00%, accuracy = 85.28%, and AUC = 0.908), while the LR model performed the worst (sensitivity = 79.38%, specificity = 76.00%, accuracy = 77.66%, and AUC = 0.838) and the CatBoost model performed better (sensitivity = 76.28%, specificity = 85.00%, accuracy = 80.81%, and AUC = 0.893). Moreover, the LSM constructed by the CNN model did a more reasonable prediction of the distribution of susceptible areas. As for feature selection, a more detailed analysis of conditioning factors was conducted, but the results were uncertain. The result analyzed by GI may be more reliable but fluctuates with the amount of data. The conclusion reveals that the accuracy of LSM can be further improved with the advancement of algorithms, by determining more representative features, which serve as a more effective guide for land use planning in the study area or other highlands where landslides are frequent. © 2023 by the authors.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland),10.3390/app13127276,2,2,Yes,"LOGR,CB,CNN",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We selected a case study region that is frequently affected by landslides, the important Kamyaran–Sarvabad road in the Kurdistan province of Iran. Altogether, 14 landslide evaluation factors were input into the MLAs including slope, aspect, elevation, river density, distance to river, distance to fault, fault density, distance to road, road density, land use, slope curvature, lithology, stream power index (SPI), and topographic wetness index (TWI). We identified 64 locations of landslides by field survey of which 70% were randomly employed for building and training the three MLAs while the remaining locations were used for validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) reached a value of 0.94 for the decision tree compared to 0.82 for the random forest, and 0.75 for support vector machines model.

Considering the difference in topography and neglected landslide events, particularly in transboundary areas of the Himalayas, it is necessary to precisely model the susceptibility in relation to spatial heterogeneity. In this study, we have used multisource remote sensing data, open-source geographical data, and multisource landslide event inventories for the past 20 years (2000−2020). In addition, machine learning methods were implemented to establish a landslide susceptibility model with internal landslide drivers within the transboundary areas. Considering the spatial heterogeneity, the landslide susceptibility of the northern and southern slope in the transboundary areas of the Himalayas was determined using Google Earth Engine (GEE), an online cloud platform. Furthermore, we generated a thematic map of landslide susceptibility at a spatial resolution of 500 m, considering the contribution rate of each landslide internal driver of the landslide. Finally, we analyzed the landslide drivers in areas with high landslide susceptibility and low landslide event point density. The main results are as follows: (i) elevation, aspect, and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) are top three internal drivers of susceptibility on the northern and southern slopes. Meanwhile, the northern slope is dominated by geological, seismic, and soil structure parameters while the southern slope is dominated by terrain, geomorphological, and land cover parameters; (ii) elevation, aspect, and FVC of 3400–4100 m, 260°–335°, and 8 %–30 %, respectively, are related to high landslide susceptibility on the northern slope, while elevation, aspect, and FVC of 980–2100 m, 170°–230°, 70 %–98 %, respectively, are related to high landslide susceptibility on the southern slope, which presents more extreme landslide-susceptible areas compared with the northern slope; and (iii) areas with high landslide susceptibility and low landslide event density are universal. These insights demonstrate that modeling and analyzing the heterogeneity of landslide susceptibility of the northern and southern slopes in transboundary areas of the Himalayas are required to provide a reference for locating and preventing landslide disasters, increase to the focus on landslide-susceptible areas, improve the data gap between landslide inventories and actual landslide events, and reduce the impact of missing data in landslide inventories for this region. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Geomorphology,10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108723,2,2,Yes,RF,,"China,Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we employed state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms including XgBoost, LR, KNN, SVM, and Adaboost for landslide susceptibility prediction. To find the best hyperparameters of each individual classifier for optimized performance, we have incorporated the Grid Search method, with 10 Fold Cross-validation. In this context, the optimized version of XgBoost outperformed all other classifiers with a Cross-validation Weighted F1 score of 94.62%.

Here, 70% of the data were randomly selected for training and remaining was used for validation and optimization of the models using statistical implications and validation assessment methods. The result showed that the high and very high landslide susceptible areas are mainly concentrated in the middle portion along the Bhalukpong-Bomdia road section. Based on the AUC value and other statistical indicators it has been observed that AdaBoost is the most efficient model here (AUC = 0.92). AUC values of SVM and XGBoost are 0.85 and 0.89 respectively.

Feature selection is a crucial task in applying machine learning as meticulously selected features can significantly improve the performance of the machine learning model. These selected features decrease the learning time of the model and increase comprehensibility.

Hence, this study was planned to evaluate the effectiveness of landslide susceptibility prediction along an earthquake-affected road section of Neelum Highway using six different data-driven models. We applied analytical hierarchy process as a heuristic approach, weight of evidence and index of entropy as statistical models and multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine and binary logistic regression (BLR) as machine learning models. Initially, 224 landslide locations were marked through field surveys to prepare a landslide inventory, which was further randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. Then, 13 landslide causative factors (LCFs) were extracted from geospatial database and analysed by measuring collinearity among factors and assessing their contribution to landslide occurrence using different feature selection methods for inclusion in susceptibility modelling. Thereafter, six employed models were trained to produce landslide susceptibility maps of the investigated road section. Finally, the area under receiver operating characteristics (AU-ROC) curve and various statistical measures were applied to validate and compare the performance of modelled landslide susceptibility. The results revealed that no collinearity issue exists among all 13 LCFs, and all six models exhibited satisfying performance in predicting landslide susceptibility of study area.

Three distinct machine learning (ML) models, namely the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Maximum Entropy (ME), and Random Forest (RF), were employed to identify the key contributing factors to landslide occurrences in the study region. The dataset used in this study consisted of landslide conditioning factors and a landslide inventory map. The conditioning factors encompassed lithology, soil type, plane curvature, profile curvature, elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, land use/land cover (LULC), distance to fault, river, road, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI), and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The landslide inventory map contained 177 landslide locations and 65 non-landslide points obtained from Google Earth. Each machine learning (ML) model was trained and implemented independently using 70% of the training data, with the results validated against the remaining 30% of the landslide inventory dataset. Ensemble results from GLM, ME, and RF were obtained using the median approach. All three models exhibited consistent performance and identified similar landslide-prone areas. Among the various factors studied, proximity to rivers emerged as the most influential factor contributing to landslides, followed by the distance to roads and slope gradient. The study revealed that the districts of Argo and Yaftali Sufla, near Faizabad, were identified as particularly susceptible to landslides, especially in the vicinity of large valleys. Out of the total study area of 3086.4 km2, ∼2162 km2 were deemed relatively safe from landslides, while 149 km2 (representing 4.8% of the study region) were identified as highly susceptible to landslides. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) statistics were used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning (ML) algorithms.

This study proposes an improved spatial case-based reasoning (SCBR) considering multiple spatial drivers to overcome above problems and uses landslide susceptibility mapping as an example. Specifically, these spatial drivers were captured, extracted, and integrated into case representation by using geographic self-organizing mapping algorithm, spatial statistic, and spatial adjacent matrix, respectively. Additionally, the K-nearest neighbor method as case retrieval was introduced to retrieve the K similar cases based on the local and global similarity reasoning. Finally, the Gaussian process regression as case reuse method was generated to landslide susceptibility index under the assumption that K similar cases follows Gaussian distribution. Our experimental results show that the precision, F1, recall, and kappa of the proposed SCBR method are 0.974, 0.976, 0.979, and 0.953 which are higher than those of the traditional case-based reasoning (0.931, 0.941, 0.953, and 0.881), long short-term memory (0.951, 0.933, 0.915, and 0.870), and extreme gradient boosting decision tree (0.963, 0.967, 0.972, and 0.945), respectively. In general, the novel approach with better predictive performance can help decision makers to develop policies that reduce the loess of landslides and apply to similar geological events. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Catena,10.1016/j.catena.2023.106940,2,2,Yes,KNN,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They directly threaten human lives and properties every year. Landslide susceptibility maps are useful tools for risk mitigation, land-use planning, and early warning systems for local areas. It is necessary to update these maps continuously because of the complexity of landslide events. This fact requires further extending the approach techniques with practical implications. Therefore, this study aimed to develop landslide susceptibility prediction maps based on advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. Five state-of-the-art hybrid ML models were developed: bagging MLP, dagging MLP, decorate MLP, rotation forest MLP, and random subspace MLP with multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a base classifier. Sixteen causative factors were collected to build landslide susceptibility maps based on the relationship between historical landslide locations and specific local geo-environmental conditions. The model performance was verified using various statistical indexes. Based on the area under ROC curve (AUC) analysis results of the testing dataset, the rotation forest MLP model has the greatest predictive accuracy of AUC = 0.818. It is followed by the decorate MLP and bagging MLP (AUC = 0.804), the random subspace MLP model (AUC = 0.796), the dagging MLP (AUC = 0.789), and the single MLP (AUC = 0.698).

Previous studies have proposed support vector machine (SVM) as a small-sample learning method. However, those studies demonstrated that different parameters can affect model performance. We optimized the SVM and obtained models as 5-fold cross validation (5-CV) SVM, genetic algorithm (GA) SVM, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) SVM. This study compared the prediction performances of logistic regression (LR), 5-CV SVM, GA SVM, and PSO SVM on landslide susceptibility mapping, to explore the spatial distribution of landslide susceptibility in the study area in Tibetan Plateau, China. A geospatial database was established based on 392 historical landslides and 392 non-landslides in the study area. We used 11 influencing factors of altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to road, distance to river, distance to fault, peak ground acceleration (PGA), and rainfall to construct an influencing factor evaluation system. To evaluate the models, four susceptibility maps were compared via receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the results showed that prediction rates for the models are 84% (LR), 87% (5-CV SVM), 85% (GA SVM), and 90% (PSO SVM). We also used precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy to assess the quality performance of these models.

Then, a single machine learning model can easily become overfitting, thus reducing the accuracy and robustness of the evaluation model. This paper proposes a combined machine-learning model to address the issues. The landslide susceptibility in mountain roads were mapped by using factor analysis to normalize and reduce the dimensionality of the initial condition factor and generating six new combination factors as evaluation indexes. The mountain roads in the Youxi County, Fujian Province, China were used for the landslide susceptibility mapping. Three most frequently used machine learning techniques, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) models, were used to model the landslide susceptibility of the study area and validate the accuracy of this evaluation index system. The global minimum variance portfolio was utilized to construct a machine learning combined model. 5-fold cross-validation, statistical indexes, and AUC (Area Under Curve) values were implemented to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the landslide susceptibility model. The mean AUC values for the SVM, RF, and ANN models in the training stage were 89.2%, 88.5%, and 87.9%, respectively, and 78.0%, 73.7%, and 76.7%, respectively, in the validating stage. In the training and validation stages, the mean AUC values of the combined model were 92.4% and 87.1%, respectively.

This research proposes a method combining a self-organizing-map (SOM) and a one-class SVM (SOM-OCSVM) to generate more reasonable non-landslide samples. We designed two steps: first, a random selection, a SOM network, a one class SVM model, and a SOM-OCSVM model were used to generate non-landslide sample datasets. Second, four machine learning models (MLs)—namely logistic regression (LRG), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)—were used to verify the effects of four non-landslide sample datasets on LSM. From the region along the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, we selected 11 conditioning factors and 1186 investigated landslides to perform the aforementioned experiments. The results show that the SOM-OCSVM method achieves the highest AUC (>0.94) and minimum standard deviation (<0.081) compared with other methods. Moreover, RF achieves the best performance in different datasets compared with other ML models. The aforementioned results prove that the proposed method can enhance the performance of ML models to produce more reliable LSM.

To create a comprehensive inventory of landslide occurrences, high-resolution satellite imagery, topographic maps, historical records, and GPS data gathered through fieldwork were employed. In total, 402 known landslide sites were used for modeling and validating the landslide occurrences in the study area. Sixteen factors were integrated: topography, hydrology, soil type, geology, and ecology. The training dataset comprised 72% of all landslide locations, while the remaining 28% was used to validate the generated landslide occurrences. The different models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The analysis of both the training and validation datasets was used to determine the model’s accuracy. To improve the performance of the multilayer perceptron neural network architecture, the HS, ERWCA, SFLA, and WOA algorithms were applied to improve its efficiency. The accuracy of the applied prediction models was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) measure before creating landslide vulnerability charts in a GIS framework. The results showed that the HS-MLP had the greatest estimated AUCs for population sizes in training databases equal to 50, with values of 0.9921 and 0.9828 for training databases and testing databases, respectively. Similar to this, in the training and testing databases, the AUC values for the ER_WCAMLP with a 200-swarm swarm size were determined to be 0.9998 and 0.9821, respectively. For population sizes of 150 and 500, respectively, the training and testing AUCs for the SFLA-MLP were determined to be 0.984 and 0.9821, and 0.9867 and 0.9873, respectively, for the WOA-MLP. The best solution was found after 50, 200, 150, and 500 iterations for the models that used the population in the best fit HS, ER_WCA, SFLA, and WOA algorithms, respectively. In light of these findings, managers and planners can benefit from this research's findings in pre-crisis management as it demonstrates how optimization algorithms have improved the neural network’s accuracy and performance in the evaluation and detection of problematic areas. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Environment, Development and Sustainability",10.1007/s10668-023-04117-9,2,2,Yes,ANN,,"China,United States,Iran,Viet Nam",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The global prediction results were then validated using additional regional landslide inventories, including three countries, three provinces, and two prefecture-level datasets. Moreover, the global prediction results of 90 m are used to improve the performance of regional LSP. Specifically, the low-and very low-prone areas in the global prediction results were used as non-landslide samples for susceptibility modeling. Results demonstrated that the model achieved a better performance than original global prediction results.

Considering the time-consuming compilation of landslide inventories as a prerequisite for landslide susceptibility mapping, model transferability can be key to making hazard-related information available to stakeholders in a timely manner. In this paper, we compare and combine two important transfer-learning strategies for landslide susceptibility modeling: case-based reasoning (CBR) and domain adaptation (DA). Care-based reasoning gathers knowledge from previous similar situations (source areas) and applies it to solve a new problem (target area). Domain adaptation, which is widely used in computer vision, selects data from a source area that has a similar distribution to the target area. We assess the performances of single- and multiple-source CBR, DA, and CBR-DA strategies to train and combine landslide susceptibility models using generalized additive models (GAMs) for 10 study areas with various resolutions (1, 10, and 25 m) located in Austria, Ecuador, and Italy. The performance evaluation shows that CBR and combined CBR-DA based on our proposed similarity criterion were able to achieve performances comparable to benchmark models trained in the target area itself. Particularly the CBR strategies yielded favorable results in both single- and multi-source strategies. Although DA tended to have overall lower performances than CBR, it had promising results in scenarios where the source-target similarity was low. We recommend that future transfer-learning research for landslide susceptibility modeling can build on the similarity criterion we used, as it successfully helped to transfer landslide susceptibility models by identifying suitable source regions for model training. © 2022 Zhihao Wang et al.",Geoscientific Model Development,10.5194/gmd-15-8765-2022,4,2,Yes,GAM,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Landslide susceptibility evaluation (LSE) is a vital and effective technique for the prevention and control of disastrous landslides. Moreover, about 80% of disastrous landslides had not been discovered ahead and significantly impeded social and economic sustainability development. However, the present studies on LSE mainly focus on the known landslides, neglect the great threat posed by the potential landslides, and thus to some degree constrain the precision and rationality of LSE maps. Moreover, at present, potential landslides are generally identified by the characteristics of surface deformation, terrain, and/or geomorphology. The essential disaster-inducing mechanism is neglected, which has caused relatively low accuracies and relatively high false alarms. Therefore, this work suggests new synthetic criteria of potential landslide identification. The criteria involve surface deformation, disaster-controlling features, and disaster-triggering characteristics and improve the recognition accuracy and lower the false alarm. Furthermore, this work combines the known landslides and discovered potential landslides to improve the precision and rationality of LSE. This work selects Chaya County, a representative region significantly threatened by landslides, as the study area and employs multisource data (geological, topographical, geographical, hydrological, meteorological, seismic, and remote sensing data) to identify potential landslides and realize LSE based on the time-series InSAR technique and XGBoost algorithm. The LSE precision indices of AUC, Accuracy, TPR, F1-score, and Kappa coefficient reach 0.996, 97.98%, 98.77%, 0.98, and 0.96, respectively, and 16 potential landslides are newly discovered. Moreover, the development characteristics of potential landslides and the cause of high landslide susceptibility are illuminated.

To validate the model performance, a landslide inventory containing 1147 historical landslide polygons and the data of 12 landslide factors in the Wenchuan area in southwestern China, was presented and separated into training and validating dataset using a 7:3 randomly sampling ratio strategy. Based on AUC and Accuracy, GL-ResNet (0.96 and 0.909) outperformed logistic regression (0.92 and 0.851), support vector machines (0.94 and 0.884), deep belief networks (0.95 and 0.884), gated recurrent unit (0.94 and 0.884) and ResNet (0.95 and 0.894). We also explored the robustness of GL-ResNet for LSM. The results suggested that although GL-ResNet is sensitive to initial training conditions, it showed good robustness to model training method and sample ratios.

In the present study, a novel deep learning-based landslide susceptibility assessment method named deep random neural network (DRNN) is proposed. In DRNN, a random mechanism is constructed to drop network layers and nodes randomly during landslide modeling. We take the Lushui area (Southwest China) as the case and select 12 landslide conditioning factors to perform landslide modeling. The performance evaluation results show that our method achieves desirable generalization performance (Kappa = 0.829) and outperforms other network models such as the convolution neural network (Kappa = 0.767), deep feedforward neural network (Kappa = 0.731), and Adaboost-based artificial neural network (Kappa = 0.732). Moreover, the robustness test shows the advantage of our DRNN, which is insensitive to variations in training data size. Our method yields an accuracy higher than 85% when the training data size stands at only 10%.

However, most of the existing articles only utilize visual features. Even if the advanced FCNN models are applied, there is still a certain amount of falsely detected and miss detected landslides. In this article, we innovatively introduce landslide susceptibility as prior knowledge and propose an innovative susceptibility-guided landslide detection method based on FCNN (SG-FCNN) to detect landslides from single temporal images. In addition, an unsupervised change detection method based on the mean changing magnitude of objects (MCMO) is further proposed and integrated with the SG-FCNN to detect newly occurred landslides from bitemporal images. The effectiveness of the proposed SG-FCNN and MCMO has been tested in Lantau Island, Hong Kong. The experimental results show that the SG-FCNN can significantly reduce the amount of falsely detected and miss detected landslides compared with the FCNN. It can conclude that applying landslide susceptibility as prior knowledge is much more effective than using visual features only, which introduces a new methodology of landslide detection and lifts the detection performance to a new level. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,10.1109/jstars.2022.3233043,2,2,Yes,CNN,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that the recall rate, F1-score, and mIoU of the model were improved by 0.08, 0.09, and 0.15, respectively, compared to FCN. It also demonstrated advantages over U-Net and SegNet. The results prove that the method proposed in this study can solve the problem of imbalanced sample in landslide inventory mapping.

The first task to be done was to evaluate the vulnerability of shallow landslides based on a machine learning model (random forest (RF), a support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (Log)), and a physical model (SINMAP) in the loess tableland area. By comparing the differences, the best method for evaluating the vulnerability of shallow landslide was selected. The nonlinear response relationship between shallow landslides and environmental factors was quantified based on the frequency ratio. Multicollinearity analysis was used to identify 10 factors that were applied on ML to construct the spatial distribution model. The SINMAP model used a DEM and soil physical parameters to determine the stability coefficient of the study area. The results showed that (1) shallow landslides in Dongzhiyuan mainly occurred on shady slopes with an elevation of 1068–1249 m, a slope gradient of 36°–60° and a concave shape. The stream power and stream transport indexes increased with increasing rainfall erosion, making shallow landslides likely. The susceptibility of shallow landslides changed parabolically with the change in the NDVI and mainly occurred in grassland and shrubland. (2) The four methods performed similarly in predicting the sensitivity of shallow landslides. The high-incidence areas were on both sides of eroded gully slopes. The tableland and gully bottom areas were not prone to shallow landslides.

Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) is a crucial tool for landslide prevention. This paper’s primary objective is to compare the performances of conventional shallow machine learning methods and deep learning methods in LSA based on imbalanced data to evaluate the applicability of the two types of LSA models when class-weighted strategies are applied. In this article, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), deep fully connected neural network (DFCNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were employed for modeling in the Zigui-Badong area of the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. Eighteen landslide influence factors were introduced to compare the performance of four models under a class balanced strategy versus a class imbalanced strategy. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) was applied for factor correlation analysis. The results reveal that the elevation and distance to rivers play a dominant role in LSA tasks. It was observed that DFCNN (AUC = 0.87, F1-score = 0.60) and LSTM (AUC = 0.89, F1-score = 0.61) significantly outperformed LR (AUC = 0.89, F1-score = 0.50) and RF (AUC = 0.88, F1-score = 0.50) under the class imbalanced strategy. The RF model achieved comparable outcomes (AUC = 0.90, F1-score = 0.61) to deep learning models under the class balanced strategy and ran at a faster training speed (up to 63 times faster than deep learning models). The LR model performance was inferior to that of the other three models under the balanced strategy. Meanwhile, the deep learning models and the shallow machine learning models showed significant differences in susceptibility spatial patterns.

Therefore, it is crucial to have reliable prediction models for landslide susceptibility in order to identify high-risk areas and implement proactive measures to prevent or mitigate their impacts. The purpose of this study is to propose and evaluate a novel approach called BCMO-DeepNeuralNets for spatial prediction of the areas most susceptible to landslides. The study focuses on a tropical cyclone area in three districts of central Vietnam, namely Nam Tra My, Bac Tra My, and Phuoc Son. Accordingly, ten input factors were considered: slope, aspect, elevation, relief amplitude, land use, soil type, road distance, geology, fault distance, and rainfall. The proposed BCMO-DeepNeuralNets method leverages the power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to develop a deep-learning model capable of inferring landslide susceptibility indices. To optimize this model, the study employs the Balancing Composite Motions Optimization (BCMO) technique. Additionally, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used as benchmark models to confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach. To evaluate the prediction performance of the models, popular metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), accuracy (Acc), and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are employed. The results show that the BCMO-DeepNeuralNets model exhibits high prediction performance, with an MSE of 0.038, Acc of 93.4%, and AUC of 0.971. This model outperforms the benchmark models, LR and SVM. Consequently, BCMO-DeepNeuralNets emerges as a new tool with significant potential for landslide susceptibility mapping. The landslide susceptibility map generated by this research aids in the identification of landslide-prone areas, providing a more accurate understanding of associated risks. As a result, it can be instrumental in policy and decision-making processes, enabling the implementation of appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of landslides in the study area. © 2013 IEEE.",IEEE Access,10.1109/access.2023.3291411,2,2,Yes,"LOGR,SVM",,"Viet Nam,Norway",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Landslide databases at times lack information on the underlying triggering mechanism, making these inventories almost unusable in hazard models. We developed a Python-based unique library, Landsifier, that contains three different machine-Learning frameworks for assessing the likely triggering mechanisms of individual landslides or entire inventories based on landslide geometry. Two of these methods only use the 2D landslide planforms, and the third utilizes the 3D shape of landslides relying on an underlying digital elevation model (DEM). The base method extracts geometric properties of landslide polygons as a feature space for the shallow learner - random forest (RF). An alternative method relies on landslide planform images as an input for the deep learning algorithm - convolutional neural network (CNN). The last framework extracts topological properties of 3D landslides through topological data analysis (TDA) and then feeds these properties as a feature space to the random forest classifier. We tested all three interchangeable methods on several inventories with known triggers spread over the Japanese archipelago. To demonstrate the effectiveness of developed methods, we used two testing configurations. The first configuration merges all the available data for the k-fold cross-validation, whereas the second configuration excludes one inventory during the training phase to use as the sole testing inventory. Our geometric-feature-based method performs satisfactorily, with classification accuracies varying between 67ĝ€¯% and 92ĝ€¯%. We have introduced a more straightforward but data-intensive CNN alternative, as it inputs only landslide images without manual feature selection. CNN eases the scripting process without losing classification accuracy. Using topological features from 3D landslides (extracted through TDA) in the RF classifier improves classification accuracy by 12ĝ€¯% on average. TDA also requires less training data. However, the landscape autocorrelation could easily bias TDA-based classification. Finally, we implemented the three methods on an inventory without any triggering information to showcase a real-world application. © Copyright:",Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences,10.5194/nhess-22-3751-2022,3,2,Yes,"RF,CNN",,"Germany,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research applies three machine learning algorithms composed of RF (random forest), NB (naïve Bayes), and KNN (k-nearest neighbor) and 12 conditioning factors. The conditioning factors consist of slope, elevation, aspect, NDVI, geological type, soil type, distance from the fault, distance from the river, river density, TWI, land cover, and annual rainfall. This research performs seven models over three ratios between the training and testing dataset encompassing 50:50, 60:40, and 70:30 for KNN and NB algorithms and 70:30 for the RF algorithm. This research measures the performance of each model using eight parameters (ROC, AUC, ACC, SN, SP, BA, GM, CK, and MCC). The results indicate that RF 70:30 generates the best performance, witnessed by the evaluation parameters ACC (0.884), SN (0.765), GM (0.863), BA (0.857), CK (0.749), MCC (0.876), and AUC (0.943). Overall, seven models have reasonably good accuracy, ranging between 0.806 and 0.884. Furthermore, based on the best model, the study area is dominated by high susceptibility with an area coverage of 51%, which occurs in the areas with high slopes.

However, relict landslide mapping is complex in tropical regions covered with rainforest vegetation. A new CNN framework is proposed for semi-automatic detection of relict landslides, which uses a dataset generated by a k-means clustering algorithm and has a pre-training step. The weights computed in the pre-training are used to fine-tune the CNN training process. A comparison between the proposed and the standard framework is performed using CBERS-04A WPM images. Three CNNs for semantic segmentation are used (Unet, FPN and Linknet) with two augmented datasets. A total of 42 combinations of CNNs are tested. Values of precision and recall were very similar between the combinations tested. Recall was higher than 75% for every combination, but precision values were usually smaller than 20%. False positives (FP) samples were addressed as the cause for these low precision values. Predictions of the proposed framework were more accurate and correctly detected more landslides.

Landslide detection methods based on semantic segmentation can be used to delineate the scope of landslides while detecting their location.

Therefore, this article proposes Reg-SA-UNet++, a model for landslide detection, which uses a single-temporal image captured postlandslide. Reg-SA-UNet++ is based on UNet++ with the following modifications: deep supervised pruning is removed for fewer model parameters and increased detection accuracy; RegNet is employed to replace the convolutional blocks in the encoding process to reduce the number of parameters and improve feature acquisition and attention modules are added at the connection of the convolutional blocks of each layer to strengthen the model's attention to landslide features.

Accordingly, the construction of forest roads through forests should be carefully planned, especially in protection forests. Forest areas in Turkey are generally widespread in mountainous and high sloping areas that are susceptible to landslides-landslide susceptibility is one of the most important criteria for the selection of protected forests. As such, it is important to evaluate detailed and applicable alternatives regarding special areas and private forests. The aim of this study is to determine alternative routes for forest roads in protected forests through the use of geographic information systems (GIS), particularly in areas with high landslide susceptibility. To this end, a landslide susceptibility map (LSM) was created using logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) modeling methods, which are widely used in machine learning (ML). Two models with the highest receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) values were selected, and ten factors (slope, elevation, lithology, distance to road, distance to fault, distance to river, curvature, stream power index, topographic position index, and topographic wetness index) were used. The best LSM modeling method was AUC. The AUC value was 90.6% with the RF approach and 80.3% with the LR approach. The generated LSMs were used to determine alternative routes that were calculated through cost path analysis. It is hoped that the susceptibility to landslides and selection of alternative forest road routes determined through the approaches and techniques in this study will benefit forest road planning as well as plan and decision makers. © 2022 Hrvatsko Sumarsko Drustvo.

Even though the acquiring and processing of remote sensing images are costly and time- and labor-consuming, the development of open source data platforms relieved these burdens by providing free imagery. The open source images also accelerate the generation of algorithms with large datasets. Thus, this study evaluated the generalizability of forest change detection by using open source airborne images and the U-Net model.

The airborne and tree annotation images of the capital area in South Korea were processed for building U-Net input, while the pre-trained U-Net structure was adopted and fine-tuned for model training.

This method comprehensively considered the geological and dynamic surface deformation information, and was applied in some areas of Maoxian County. We selected twelve influencing factors (elevation, slope, relief amplitude, curvature, aspect, engineering geological rock group, distance to fault, distance to river, land type, vegetation type, and topographic wetness index, rainfall) and used the traditional machine learning method for landslide susceptibility. Then, the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology was introduced to modify the unsuitable zoning of the traditional landslide susceptibility. Based on the improved landslide susceptibility mapping, field investigation and UAV models were used to verify. The results showed that the introduction of InSAR technology and UAV multi-source data can rationalize the inappropriate zoning in traditional landslide susceptibility, and landslides (L1 and L7) with very high susceptibility were identified. The field investigation and spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of typical landslides indicated that both L1 and L7 were severely damaged and in the deformation stage. L1 showed significant deformation during road construction. However, the deformation of L1 reacted on the pavement, resulting in many tensile cracks. The deformation of L7 was mainly affected by rainfall and presented the characteristics of seasonal variation, and the deformation was accelerated in the rainy season.

However, the overall extent of this widespread type of plateau collapse remains unknown and incompletely captured in local maps. To detect giant slope failures consistently throughout the region, we train two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), AlexNet and U-Net, with Sentinel-2 optical data and TanDEM-X topographic data on elevation, surface roughness, and curvature. We validated the performance of these CNNs with independent testing data and found that AlexNet performed better when learned on topographic data, and UNet when learned on optical data. AlexNet predicts a total landslide area of 12,000 km2 in a study area of 450,000 km2, and thus one of Earth's largest clusters of giant landslides. These are mostly lateral spreads and rotational failures in effusive rocks, particularly eroding the margins of basaltic plateaus; some giant landslides occurred along shores of former glacial lakes, but are least prevalent in Quaternary sedimentary rocks. Given the roughly comparable topographic, climatic, and seismic conditions in our study area, we infer that basalts topping weak sedimentary rocks may have elevated potential for large-scale slope failure. Judging from the many newly detected and previously unknown landslides, we conclude that CNNs can be a valuable tool to detect large-scale slope instability at the regional scale. However, visual inspection is still necessary to validate results and correctly outline individual landslide source and deposit areas.

The available literature is composed of a wealth of published studies and that has identified a large variety of challenges and innovations in this field. This review presents a comprehensive up-to-date overview focusing on the topic of DdLSM. This research begins with an introduction of the theoretical aspects of DdLSM research and is followed by an in-depth bibliometric analysis of 2585 publications. This analysis is based on the Web of Science, Clarivate Analytics database and provides insights into the transient characteristics and research trends within published spatial landslide assessments. Following the bibliometric analysis, a more detailed review of the most recent publications from 1985 to 2020 is given. A variety of different criteria are explored in detail, including research design, study area extent, inventory characteristics, classification algorithms, predictors utilized, and validation technique performed. This section, dealing with a quantitative-oriented review expands the time-frame of the review publication done by Reichenbach et al. in 2018 by also accounting for the four years, 2017â2020. The originality of this research is acknowledged by combining together: (a) a recap of important theoretical aspects of DdLSM; (b) a bibliometric analysis on the topic; (c) a quantitative-oriented review of relevant publications; and (d) a systematic summary of the findings, indicating important aspects and potential developments related to the DdLSM research topic. The results show that DdLSM are used within a wide range of applications with study area extents ranging from a few kilometers to national and even continental scales. In more than 70% of publications, a combination of the predictors, slope angle, aspect and geology are used. Simple classifiers, such as, logistic regression or approaches based on frequency ratio are still popular, despite the upcoming trend of applying machine learning algorithms. When analyzing validation techniques, 38% of the publications were not clear about the validation method used. Within the studies that included validation techniques, the AUROC was the most popular validation metric, being used accounting for 44% of the studies. Finally, it can be concluded that the application of new classification techniques is often cited as a main research scope, even though the most relevant innovation could also lie in tackling data-quality issues and research designs adaptations to fit the input data particularities in order to improve prediction quality.

Fast and accurate mapping of coseismic landslides is important for earthquake disaster emergency rescue and landslide risk analysis. Machine learning methods provide automatic solutions for landslide detection, which are more efficient than manual landslide mapping. Deep learning technologies are attracting increasing interest in automatic landslide detection. CNN is one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks for landslide detection. However, in practice, the performance of the existing CNN-based landslide detection models is still far from practical application. Recently, Transformer has achieved better performance in many computer vision tasks, which provides a great opportunity for improving the accuracy of landslide detection. To fill this gap, we explore whether Transformer can outperform CNNs in the landslide detection task. Specifically, we build a new dataset for identifying coseismic landslides. The Transformer-based semantic segmentation model SegFormer is employed to identify coseismic landslides. SegFormer leverages Transformer to obtain a large receptive field, which is much larger than CNN. SegFormer introduces overlapped patch embedding to capture the interaction of adjacent image patches. SegFormer also introduces a simple MLP decoder and sequence reduction to improve its efficiency. The semantic segmentation results of SegFormer are further improved by leveraging image processing operations to distinguish different landslide instances and remove invalid holes. Extensive experiments have been conducted to compare Transformer-based model SegFormer with other popular CNN-based models, including HRNet, DeepLabV3, Attention-UNet, U2Net and FastSCNN. SegFormer improves the accuracy, mIoU, IoU and F1 score of landslide detectuin by 2.2%, 5% and 3%, respectively. SegFormer also reduces the pixel-wise classification error rate by 14%.

Compared to a traditional landslide detection approach, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proven to have powerful capabilities in reducing the time consumed for selecting the appropriate features for landslides. Currently, the success of transformers in natural language processing (NLP) demonstrates the strength of selfattention in global semantic information acquisition. How to effectively integrate transformers into CNN, alleviate the limitation of the receptive field, and improve the model generation are hot topics in remote sensing image processing based on deep learning (DL). Inspired by the vision transformer (ViT), this paper first attempts to integrate a transformer into ResU-Net for landslide detection tasks with small datasets, aiming to enhance the network ability in modelling the global context of feature maps and drive the model to recognize landslides with a small dataset. Besides, a spatial and channel attention module was introduced into the decoder to effectually suppress the noise in the feature maps from the convolution and transformer. By selecting two landslide datasets with different geological characteristics, the feasibility of the proposed model was validated. Finally, the standard ResU-Net was chosen as the benchmark to evaluate the proposed model rationality. The results indicated that the proposed model obtained the highest mIoU and F1-score in both datasets, demonstrating that the ResU-Net with a transformer embedded can be used as a robust landslide detection method and thus realize the generation of accurate regional landslide inventory and emergency rescue.

Preparation of landslide inventory maps is a prerequisite in the assessment of landslide hazards and risks. The conventional methods for acquiring landslide inventory maps involve extensive field surveys and photograph interpretation, making it tedious and highly reliant on expert judgment. To this aim, an object-based approach is proposed to prepare landslide inventory map, which ensures faster acquisition and assimilation of landslide data. As a first step toward the approach, the digital terrain model (DTM) is obtained from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data for the study area. Wavelet transform technique is performed in tandem with machine learning (ML) algorithms (random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM)) to measure the texture of DTM and to train and predict the landslide objects. A small area (area = 1.16 km2) from the Western Ghats, India, is selected for this case study. The results indicate that the RF and SVM algorithms predict landslide objects with 88.64% and 87.45% accuracy, respectively. This study also investigated the effect of texture (wavelet coefficient) on the accuracy of ML algorithms. An important observation from this study is that the curvature mean is the most influential object feature to demarcate a landslide event. The proposed approach generates output in the form of landslide inventory map for the study area.

However, such methods are highly labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly over large areas. This paper proposed an automated co-seismic landslide mapping approach, which has three main advantages compared to state-of-the-art methods. First, it removes the dependence on the manual labeling for training samples through an unsupervised change detection process. Second, the approach takes the lead in introducing multi-scale extended morphological profiles to comprehensively describe the characteristics of various landslides induced by earthquake. Third, it is also the first attempt to employ ensemble strategy in landslide identification, which integrates the advantages of different machine learning-based classifiers, further improving the accuracy of recognition. Three experiments were carried out through multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images acquired in China and Haiti.

Those studies are mainly morphologic analysis, estimates of landslide deposit volumes, thermal properties of the landslides, spectral analyses, and mapping and classifying landslides. But, this study created a robust landslide inventory of 682 incidents by collation of data from different sources, apart from our own mapping. This mapping was done for the completeness and accuracy of the landslide inventory. This inventory consists of 141 debris flows, 291 rock avalanches, and 250 slumps. This classification was based on the available literature, and these landslides covered Hebes, Ophir, Candor, Melas, Coprates, Ius and Tithonium chasmas. Landslides were mapped with the aid of images from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Context Camera (CTX), Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) Mars Colour Camera (MCC), and high-resolution Google Mars. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Mars Express (MEX) High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), Thermal Inertia (TI) from Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), and available geological map were used to define 15 critical parameters of the landslide inventory viz., length (L), width (W), relative relief (RR), area, L/W ratio, RR/L ratio, TI of landslide (mean, minimum, maximum), and slope statistics (mean, minimum, maximum), TI of the scarp, the slope of the scarp, and geology. These 15 parameters were subjected to a multicollinearity testing, which excluded the dependent variable TI (mean). Further, the rest of the variables were analyzed using multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), where the parameters RR/L, L/W, and RR showed higher canonical discriminant function coefficients of 1.245, 0.461 and 0.159, respectively, suggesting that these are the parameters that primarily discriminates the landslides. The classification of landslides was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation method using different machine learning algorithms. The five models that provided the best results are simple logistic, logistic regression, meta-classifier, multi-layer perceptron, and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). Of these, simple logistics has the maximum classification accuracy of 81.09%. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of using machine learning models to classify extra-terrestrial landslides, especially the long-runout landslides that are characteristics of other planets and satellites.

In case of high-intensity events, landslide mitigation is not always possible so that the best way to prevent disasters is to reduce the exposed value in susceptible areas. Landslide risk assessment is a fundamental tool for reducing loss induced by landslides, especially considering the impact of high-intensity landslides on the socioeconomic development of developing countries. Risk mitigation requires, at least, to be based on a susceptibility scenario and on inventory of existing settlements. On this basis, a study concerning landslide impacting settlements in the city of Cuenca (Ecuador) has been carried out using a landslide inventory database (LID) and supply energy contract database representing a proxy of buildings presence. The susceptibility analysis indicates that most of the slope surrounding the city of Cuenca, where the greatest urban expansion has taken place, is highly prone to instability. In addition, multi-temporal supply energy contract analysis highlights that expansion of urban areas is occurring at a steady rate and such extension is corresponding to an increase in areas susceptible to landslide.

To reflect the advantages of the transfer learning method more intuitively, this study not only tested the accuracy of the evaluation model but also used ANN to train another evaluation model based on the small sample datasets. And the model accuracy was compared with that of the previous model. The results showed that the frequency ratio (FR) accuracy of the model obtained by transfer learning was higher than that of the model directly trained on a small sample dataset. Additionally, the area under curve (AUC) of the model directly trained on a small sample dataset was only 0.84, whereas the AUC of the model obtained by transfer learning was close to 0.90.

The validation has been performed in the context of the Metropolitan City of Florence, data from 2013 to 2019. The method based on XGBoost achieved best results, demonstrating that it is the most reliable and robust against false alarms. Finally, we applied explainable artificial intelligence techniques locally and globally to derive a deep understanding of the predictive model's outputs and features' relevance, and relationships. The analysis allowed us to identify the best feature for short term predictions and their impact in local cases and global prediction model. Solutions have been implemented on Snap4City.org infrastructure. Â© 2013 IEEE.",IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3158328,2,1,No,,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A critical step in managing landslide risks is to predict the time, locations, and consequences of slope failures in future rainstorms. Based on comprehensive databases of in-service man-made slopes, rainstorms, and landslides in Hong Kong in the past 35 years, a spatio-temporal landslide forecasting model for man-made slopes is developed in this study within a unified machine learning framework. With a storm-based data integration strategy and multiclass classification on landslide scales, the framework incorporates landslide time and consequences into landslide susceptibility mapping to successfully achieve spatio-temporal landslide forecasting. The machine learning-based landslide forecasting model is validated against historical landslide incidents both temporally and spatially and through a case study of the June 2008 storm, and significantly outperforms the prevailing statistical rainfall-landslide correlations in the prediction accuracy. The model can predict the real-time evolution of probabilities, scales, and spatial distribution of landslides during the progression of a rainstorm, which can never be achieved by statistical methods. It can serve as an essential module for state-of-the-art landslide risk assessment and early warning.

However, the effects of using different training datasets and causative factors combinations on the accuracy of the results are rarely discussed. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of training data and computation technique selection on the accuracy and performance of LSMs. Results show that including relict landslides in the training data diminishes the accuracy of the LSMs compared to models that exclude such processes from the input. As for the effect of choosing different combinations of predictive variables, it was shown to be less significant. After investigating association and causality between predictive variables, the best performing models produced using frequency ratio and logistic regression tend to be more accurate than those including all variables.

It is imperative to explore a low-cost and highly applicable method to manage and prevent landslide disasters. As a hot spot in the current artificial intelligence field, deep learning can better simulate the formation of landslide disasters and accurately predict potential slopes. Thus, to explore the application potential of deep learning, this paper constructs one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional forms of landslide data, and then introduces three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based landslide susceptibility analysis frameworks, including CNN-based classifiers, integrated models, and ensemble models. The proposed deep learning methods were applied to Yanshan County, Jiangxi Province for experiments. 16 landslide influencing factors were first selected for modelling based on the geomorphological, hydrological, and geological environment conditions of the study area. These factors include altitude, aspect, distance to faults, land use, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index, plan curvature, profile curvature, rainfall, distance to rivers, distance to roads, slope, soil, stream power index, sediment transport index, and topographic wetness index. Then, the multi-collinearity analysis and relief-F algorithm were used to analyze and screen the influencing factors. All CNN-based methods were constructed and validated based on several statistical measures of accuracy, root mean square error, mean absolute error, sensitivity, specificity, and the receiver operation characteristic curve. Finally, the susceptibility value of each pixel in the study area was predicted based on the CNN-based methods, and the entire study areas were reclassified into five susceptibility categories: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The factor analysis results show that the plan curvature, profile curvature, stream power index, and sediment transport index are redundant factors and should be removed from further modelling process. The model evaluation results demonstrate that all CNN-based models can obtain accurate and reliable landslide susceptibility mapping results. The two-dimensional CNN model achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 78.95% among single CNN models. Moreover, the performance of logistic regression was effectively improved by combining the two-dimensional CNN for feature extraction, with an accuracy improvement of 7.9%. Besides, the heterogeneous ensemble strategy can greatly improve landslide prediction accuracy when using CNN classifiers, with an accuracy improvement between 4.35% and 8.78%. Generally, the CNN has been proven to have huge application potential in landslide susceptibility analysis and can be implemented in other landslide-prone areas with similar geo-environmental conditions.

The aim of this work is to apply the Supervised ML technique to train a model able to classify a particular gravity-driven coastal hillslope geomorphic model (slope-over-wall) in-volving most of the soft rocks of Cilento (southern Italy). To train the model, only geometric data have been used, namely morphometric feature maps computed on a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. Morphometric maps were computed using third-order polynomials, so as to obtain products that best describe landforms. Not all morphometric parameters from literature were used to train the model, the most significant ones were cho-sen by applying the Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) method. Different models were trained and the main indicators derived from the confusion matrices were compared. The best results were obtained using the Weighted k-NN model (accuracy score = 75%). Analysis of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves also shows that the discriminating capacity of the test reached percentages higher than 95%. The model, resulting more accurate in the training area, will be extended to similar areas along the Tyrrhenian coastal land. Â© 2021 by the authors.

To solve this problem, this study develops the Absence Point Generation (APG) toolbox which is a Python-based ArcGIS toolbox for automated construction of absence-datasets for geospatial studies. The APG employs a frequency ratio analysis of four commonly used and important driving factors such as altitude, slope degree, topographic wetness index, and distance from rivers, and considers the presence locations buffer and density layers to define the low potential or susceptibility zones where absence-datasets are generated. To test the APG toolbox, we applied two benchmark algorithms of random forest (RF) and boosted regression trees (BRT) in a case study to investigate groundwater potential using three absence datasets i.e., the APG, random, and selection of absence samples (SAS) toolbox. The BRT-APG and RF-APG had the area under receiver operating curve (AUC) values of 0.947 and 0.942, while BRT and RF had weaker performances with the SAS and Random datasets. This effect resulted in AUC improvements for BRT and RF by 7.2, and 9.7% from the Random dataset, and AUC improvements for BRT and RF by 6.1, and 5.4% from the SAS dataset, respectively. The APG also impacted the importance of the input factors and the pattern of the groundwater potential maps, which proves the importance of absence points in environmental binary issues. The proposed APG toolbox could be easily applied in other environmental hazards such as landslides, floods, and gully erosion, and land subsidence.

These natural disasters are related to geological and extreme meteorological phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes) occurring in regions that have already suffered similar previous natural catastrophes. Therefore, to effectively mitigate the landslide risks, new methodologies must better identify and understand all these landslide hazards through proper management. Within these methodologies, those based on assessing the landslide susceptibility increase the predictability of the areas where one of these disasters is most likely to occur. In the last years, much research has used machine learning algorithms to assess susceptibility using different sources of information, such as remote sensing data, spatial databases, or geological catalogues. This study presents the first attempt to develop a methodology based on an automatic machine learning (AutoML) framework. These frameworks are intended to facilitate the development of machine learning models, with the aim to enable researchers focus on data analysis. The area to test/validate this study is the center and southern region of Guerrero (Mexico), where we compare the performance of 16 machine learning algorithms. The best result achieved is the extra trees with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.983.

First, using the MIL framework, the network is trained only by the scene-level samples and it reduces the need for pixel-level samples. Second, a change-detection network architecture using a two-stream U-Net with shared weights is designed to learn the deep features of the landslide from the two-period aerial images, reducing the false-positive results. Third, integrating a gated attention-based pooling layer and a fast level-set evolution algorithm can finally produce the pixel-level results. Experimental results show that the proposed CDMI-Net achieves comparable and even better performance on the testing image pairs than all other methods and has great potential for the landslide mapping application.

Taking the landslides in Ningdu County of Jiangxi Province as examples, the frequency ratios of various environmental factors under different spatial resolutions(15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 m) are firstly calculated. Then, the landslide and non-landslide samples are divided into different model training and testing datasets with the proportions of 9/1, 8/2, 7/3, 6/4 and 5/5, and the model input and output variables under 25 combined conditions are obtained. Furthermore, these input and output variables are imported into the Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Random Forest(RF) models to carry out LSP. Finally, the uncertainties of LSP modeling under the 25 combined conditions are discussed using the accuracy assessment as well as the distribution characteristics of landslide susceptibility indexes. The results show that the landslide susceptibility accuracy predicted by the RF model under the spatial resolution of 15 m and training and testing dataset proportion of 9: 1 is the highest, and that the more important environmental factors under each condition are elevation, slope and topographic relief, etc. With decreasing the spatial resolution and/or the proportion of training and testing dataset, the LSP accuracies of both SVM and RF models decrease gradually, and the mean values of landslide susceptibility indexes increase with a decrease of the corresponding standard deviation value. For all combined conditions, as the spatial resolutions and the proportions of training and testing dataset decrease, the LSP accuracies decrease gradually while the corresponding uncertainties increase. It is also indicated that the LSP accuracy of the RF model is better than that of the SVM model under various combined conditions, and that the influence of the spatial resolution on the RF model is significantly greater than that of the proportion of training and testing dataset while there is little difference between the effects of the two factors on the SVM model.

We then applied a deep learning neural network method to incorporate other spatial geo-environmental data such as topographic, hydrologic, soil, forest, and geology, i.e., independent variables that can be used to predict the factor of safety in the catchment scale.

The disaster associated with slope failures is among the most challenging ones due to the multiple driving factors and complicated mechanisms between them. In this study, a modern space remote sensing technol-ogy, InSAR, was introduced as a direct observable for the slope dynamics. The InSAR-derived displacement fields and other in situ geological and topographical factors were integrated, and their correlations with the landslide susceptibility were analyzed. Moreover, multiple machine learning approaches were applied with a goal to construct an optimal model between these complicated factors and landslide susceptibility. Two case studies were performed in the mountainous areas of Taiwan Island and the model performance was evaluated by a confusion matrix. The numerical results revealed that among different machine learning approaches, the Random Forest model out-performed others, with an average accuracy higher than 80%. More importantly, the inclusion of the InSAR data resulted in an improved model accuracy in all training approaches, which is the first to be reported in all of the scientific literature. In other words, the proposed approach provides a novel integrated technique that enables a highly reliable analysis of the landslide susceptibility so that subsequent management or reinforcement can be better planned.

In this article, we present a positive unlabeled learning method coupled with adaptive sampling and random forest (AdaPU-RF) to predict landslide susceptibility in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. This method can make full use of the landslide and nonlandslide information contained in unlabeled areas. Experimental results show that the AdaPU-RF method achieves desirable predication outcomes in terms of accuracy analysis, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty analysis.

To prevent this disastrous problem, researchers have used several approaches for landslide susceptibility modeling, for the purpose of preparing accurate maps marking landslide prone areas. Among the most frequently used approaches for landslide susceptibility mapping is the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method. However, the effectiveness of ANN methods could be enhanced by using hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, which are scarcely applied in landslide mapping. In the current study, nine hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, genetic algorithm (GA)-ANN, evolutionary strategy (ES)-ANN, ant colony optimization (ACO)-ANN, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ANN, biogeography based optimization (BBO)-ANN, gravitational search algorithm (GHA)-ANN, particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA)-ANN, grey wolves optimization (GWO)-ANN, and probability based incremental learning (PBIL)-ANN have been used to spatially predict landslide susceptibility in Algiersâ Sahel, Algeria. The modeling phase was done using a database of 78 landslides collected utilizing Google Earth images, field surveys, and six conditioning factors (lithology, elevation, slope, land cover, distance to stream, and distance to road). Initially, a gamma test was used to decrease the input variable numbers. Furthermore, the optimal inputs have been modeled by the mean of hybrid metaheuristic ANN techniques and their performance was assessed through seven statistical indicators. The comparative study proves the effectiveness of the co-evolutionary PSOGSA-ANN model, which yielded higher performance in predicting landslide susceptibility compared to the other models. Sensitivity analysis using the step-by-step technique was done afterward, which revealed that the distance to the stream is the most influential factor on landslide susceptibility, followed by the slope factor which ranked second. Lithology and the distance to road have demonstrated a moderate effect on landslide susceptibility. Based on these findings, an accurate map has been designed to help land-use managers and decision-makers to mitigate landslide hazards.

As a classical supervised non-parametric machine learning model, support vector machine (SVM) has been widely used in landslide susceptibility prediction in recent years. However, most studies focus on the application of general SVM methods, or compare SVMs as benchmark methods. SVMs with different kernel functions are rarely used in this field. In this study, we apply the general SVM and its popular variants (i.e., multiple kernel learning, infinite ensemble SVM and semi-supervised SVM) to predict landslide susceptibility, and compare their prediction performance. The experimental results show that the Laplacian-SVM has the highest prediction performance (AUC = 0.8815) among SVM-based methods. SVMs with RBF kernel can achieve higher performance than SVMs with linear kernel, indicating that RBF kernel is more suitable for solving susceptibility prediction problems. Furthermore, SVM-based methods have higher sensitivity (0.8543â0.9288) than deep learning methods (0.8237â0.8271), which proves the advantage of SVMs in finding potential landslide areas.

Results show that SVM performs better than LGR and LR among ML models. On the other hand, the performance of AHP was better than TOPSIS.

For this purpose, we constructed an optimization method that combines a convolutional neural network with the machine learning algorithm of support vector machines, quadratic discriminant analysis, Bayesian optimized gradient boosting tree, and Bayesian optimized random forest. The model inputs were 13,886 historical seismic-induced landslide events interpreted from remote sensing imagery and ten evaluation features: elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to roads, distance to rivers, distance to faults, land use pattern, and soil texture. The output was the probability of landslide occurrence for each prediction unit. Finally, we evaluated the assessed outcomes using both the receiver operating characteristic curve and 1074 latest recorded landslide dataset (2013â2020). The calculations showed that the overall susceptibility values to landslides in the highâvery high interval produced by the hybrid convolutional neural networks was 9.95%â16.91%, which is close to the actual landslide susceptibility of the region. The receiver operating characteristic curve and statistical analysis of the latest landslide event outcomes demonstrated that the hybrid Bayesian optimized gradient boosting tree model had a higher classification accuracy than the other classifiers presented in this study.

Of late, a high-level convolutional neural network (CNN) has been applied with the intention of raising the forecast precision of LSM. The primary contribution of the research was to present a model which was based on the CNN for LSM and methodically compare its capability with the traditional machine learning approaches, namely, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF). Subsequently, we used this model in the Wenchuan region, where a catastrophic earthquake happened on 12 May 2008 in China. There were 405 valuable landslides in the landslide inventory, which were divided into a training set (283 landslides) and validation set (122 landslides). Furthermore, 11 landslide causative factors were selected as the modelâs input, and each modelâs output was reclassified into five intervals according to the sensitivity. We also evaluated the modelâs performance by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and several statistical metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and other measures.

Hence, this study aims to compare the predicted performance of statistical and popular machine learning models to explore robust landslide prediction model in the landslide-prone area of NW Himalaya and investigate the compensations and limitations of these models to grasp a more precise and consistent result. This study presented machine learning approaches based on the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) and the statistical methods based on the frequency ratio (FR), information value (InfoV) and weight of evidence (WoE). For this purpose, first an inventory map of 1507 landslides was prepared and randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) dataset. Furthermore, 12 landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were extracted from geospatial dataset to prepare thematic layers in ArcGIS. Thereafter, factor analysis was performed to eliminate colinear and least important variables which can mislead the results. The results showed that all selected LCFs are noncolinear and have significant contribution on landslides initiation, however, lithology, slope angle, annual rainfall and landuse were most influential factors. For modeling purpose, landslide inventory was correlated against all LCFs and trained into six models to produce respective LSMs. Finally, the performance of produced LSM models was validated and compared through area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), Accuracy, Recall, F 1-score and Cohenâs Kappa coefficients to assess the robustness of employed models. The results exhibit that the performance scores of machine learning models were considerably superior than statistical models. While, the AUROC values based on validation dataset indicate that LR (0.89) has better prediction ability followed by SVM (0.86), ANN (0.84), FR (0.83), InfoV (0.82) and WoE (0.81) in this study. Therefore, it is reasoned out that the machine learning methods are more reliable in generating adequate LSMs. However, the LR is recommended as most efficient model for predicting landslide susceptible zones in study region and thus can be considered as robust model for landslide susceptibility assessment in similar geo-environmental regimes.

On 17 December 2017, a catastrophic flood of 7 Ã 106 m3 almost destroyed Villa Santa LucÃ­a and approximately 3 km of the southern highway (Route 7), the only land route in Chilean Patagonia that connects this vast region from north to south, exposing the vulnerability of the population and critical infrastructure to these natural hazards. The 2017 flood produced a paradigm shift on the analysis scale to understand the danger to which communities and their infrastructure are exposed. Thus, in this study, we sought to evaluate the susceptibility of landslides in the Yelcho and Rio Frio basins, whose intersection represents the origin of this great flood. For this, we used two approaches, (1) geospatial data in combination with machine learning methods using different training configurations and (2) a qualitative analysis of the landscape considering the geological and geomorphological conditions through fieldwork. For statistical modeling, we used an inventory of landslides that occurred between 2008 and 2017 and a total of 17 predictive variables, which are geoenvironmental, climatological and environmental triggers derived from volcanic and seismic activity. Our results indicate that soil moisture significantly impacted spatial susceptibility, followed by lithology, drainage density and seismic activity. Additionally, we observed that the inclusion of climatic predictors and environmental triggers increased the average performance score of the models by up to 3-5%. Based on our results, we believe that the wide distribution of volcanic-sedimentary rocks hydrothermally altered with zeolites in the western mountains of the Yelcho and Rio Frio basin are highly susceptible to generating large-scale landslides. Therefore, the town of Villa Santa Lucia and the âCarretera Australâ (Route 7) are susceptible to new landslides coming mainly from the western slope. This requires the timely implementation of measures to mitigate the impact on the population and critical infrastructure. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Current mega infrastructure development projects in the region have further boosted the importance of the area at national and international scales, yet detailed studies of landslide susceptibility in upper Indus River Basin (UIRB) is still lacking. The aim of this study is to generate and compare landslide susceptibility maps from machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and a traditional geographic information system (GIS) based approach. Past landslide locations are used for model training and testing with data of eleven controlling factors in MLAs, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) classifiers. Among the three MLAs, average accuracy of RF model is found between 89 and 90.5%, for SVM the range is between 88 and 90% and for NB the range is between 86 and 87%. The results show that the traditional GIS based weighted overlay technique overestimated vulnerable areas with most of the study area falling in moderate to high susceptible zones. The machine learning models performed much better than the traditional technique as only areas that were identified as most susceptible were locations where landslides had occurred in the past. Within the three ML techniques, RF modelâs performance is marginally better than that of the SVM model, but RF and SVM performed significantly better compared to the NB model. The resultant susceptibility maps highlight the areas where safety measures should be taken before installing mega infrastructure projects.

Precise and timely landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is significant for landslide hazard assessment and mitigation in earthquake-affected areas. State-of-the-art LSM approaches connect causative factors from various sources without considering the fusion of different information at the data modal level. To exploit the complementary information of different modalities and boost LSM accuracy, this study presents a new LSM model that integrates data modality and machine learning methods. The presented method first groups causative factors into different modal types based on their intrinsic characteristics, followed by the calculation of the pairwise similarity of modal data. The similarities of different modalities are fused using nonlinear graph fusion to generate a unified graph, which is subsequently classified using different machine learning methods to produce final LSM. Experimental results suggest that the presented method achieves higher performance than existing LSM methods. This study provides a new solution for producing precise LSM from a fusion perspective that can be applied to minimize the potential landslide risk and for sustainable use of erosion-prone slopes.

The accuracy of machine learning-based LSA often hinges on the ratio of landslide to non-landslide (or positive/negative, P/N) samples. A proper ratio of the P/N samples will significantly improve the performance of machine learning-based LSA, but an improper ratio can cause inadequate training or data pollution. Conventionally, the determination of the P/N sample ratio is based on experience or by trials and errors, which has substantial uncertainties. This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization method to optimize the P/N sample ratio for machine learning models. Firstly, Anhua County in Hunan province of China is selected as the study area because of numerous landslide disasters that occurred in recent years. Secondly, three representative machine learning models of the support vector machine (SVM), the random forest (RF) and the gradient boost decision tree (GBDT) are adopted to assess the landslide susceptibility. Subsequently, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to obtain the optimal P/N sample ratio, considering the effects of various ratios of training/test set. Finally, the improved models and the corresponding landslide susceptibility maps are established using the obtained optimal P/N sample ratio. The results show that the performance of SVM, RF and GBDT are all improved with the optimized P/N sample ratio. The highest AUC value is for the RF model (0.840, improved by 1.3%), followed by GBDT (0.831, improved by 1.3%), and SVM (0.775, improved by 0.7%). However, the RF and GBDT are more suitable than SVM to address sample unbalance issues in LSA. It is suggested to use the Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize the P/N sample ratio in machine learning-based LSA model.

Accordingly, the construction of forest roads through forests should be carefully planned, especially in protection forests. Forest areas in Turkey are generally widespread in mountainous and high sloping areas that are susceptible to landslides-landslide susceptibility is one of the most important criteria for the selection of protected forests. As such, it is important to evaluate detailed and applicable alternatives regarding special areas and private forests. The aim of this study is to determine alternative routes for forest roads in protected forests through the use of geographic information systems (GIS), particularly in areas with high landslide susceptibility. To this end, a landslide susceptibility map (LSM) was created using logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) modeling methods, which are widely used in machine learning (ML). Two models with the highest receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) values were selected, and ten factors (slope, elevation, lithology, distance to road, distance to fault, distance to river, curvature, stream power index, topographic position index, and topographic wetness index) were used. The best LSM modeling method was AUC. The AUC value was 90.6% with the RF approach and 80.3% with the LR approach. The generated LSMs were used to determine alternative routes that were calculated through cost path analysis. It is hoped that the susceptibility to landslides and selection of alternative forest road routes determined through the approaches and techniques in this study will benefit forest road planning as well as plan and decision makers.

The present research aims to evaluate as well as compare the proficiencies of six advanced machine learning techniques (MLTs) for mapping the landslide susceptibility of northern parts of Pakistan. The considered MLTs include Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), along with Random Forest. The present research was performed applying GIS and R programming language (an open-source software). Primarily, the landslide inventory map was formulated with the help of an overall 3251 historical landslide events obtained through a variety of data sources. All the historical landslide locations were arbitrarily split into two groups with a proportion of 70% for training plus 30% for validating purposes. In total, sixteen landslide influencing factors were considered for modeling landslide susceptibility. These factors comprise aspect, elevation, slope, lithology, fault density, land cover classification system, topographic wetness index, earthquake, sediment transport index, normalized difference vegetation index, rainfall, soil, stream power index, road density, profile curvature, and plan curvature. The receiver operating characteristic, the area under curve (AUC), and root mean square error approaches were employed to appraise, validate, and relate the performance of the practiced MLTs. The outcomes demonstrated that AUC for six MLTs vary from 88.5% for LDA to 92.3% for ANN. The results reveal that among the six practiced MLTs, ANN (AUC = 92.3%) and MARS (AUC = 91.7%) have shown outstanding performances.

Landslides cause huge losses to the economy as well as human beings every year around the globe. Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) plays a key role in the prevention of landslides and has been under investigation for years. Although new machine learning algorithms have achieved excellent performance in terms of prediction accuracy, a sufficient quantity of training samples is essential. In contrast, it is hard to obtain enough landslide samples in most the areas, especially for the county-level area. The present study aims to explore an optimization model in conjunction with conventional unsupervised and supervised learning methods, which performs well with respect to prediction accuracy and com-prehensibility. Logistic regression (LR), fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) and factor analysis (FA) were combined to establish four models: LR model, FCM coupled with LR model, FA coupled with LR model, and FCM, FA coupled with LR model and applied in a specific area. Firstly, an inventory with 114 landslides and 10 conditioning factors was prepared for modeling. Subsequently, four models were applied to LSP. Finally, the performance was evaluated and compared by k-fold cross-validation based on statistical measures. The results showed that the coupled model by FCM, FA and LR achieved the greatest performance among these models with the AUC (Area under the curve) value of 0.827, accuracy of 85.25%, sensitivity of 74.96% and specificity of 86.21%. While the LR model performed the worst with an AUC value of 0.736, accuracy of 77%, sensitivity of 62.52% and specificity of 72.55%. It was concluded that both the dimension reduction and sample size should be considered in modeling, and the performance can be enhanced by combining complementary methods. The combination of models should be more flexible and purposeful.

However, the extensive amount of labeled training data required by machine learning, particularly the precise negative data (i.e., non-landslide area), cannot be easily and efficiently collected. To address this issue, this study presents a one-class-classifier-based negative data generation method for rapid earthquake-induced LSM. First, an incomplete landslide inventory (i.e., positive data) was produced with the aid of change detection using before-and-after satellite images and the Geographic Information System (GIS). Second, a one-class classifier was utilized to compute the probability of landslide occurrence based on the incomplete landslide inventory followed by the negative data generation from the low landslide susceptibility areas. Third, the positive data as well as the generated negative data (i.e., non-landslide) were compounded to train a traditional binary classifier to produce the final LSM. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method is capable of achieving a result that is comparable to methods using the complete landslide inventory, and it displays good correspondence with recent landslide events, making it a suitable method for rapid earthquake-induced LSM. The findings in this study would be useful in regional disaster planning and risk reduction.

In ACO-DBN, DL optimization strategies were added to DBN and their combined parameters were optimized with ACO. Next, Pearson's correlation coefficient and random forest importance ranking methods were utilized to optimize landslide causative factors.

The AHP model incorporates 11 geo-hydrological and environmental variables as predictors sourced from remote-sensing datasets to generate the LS susceptibility as output. Twenty-three field-based validation locations validate the test result. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the observed (? COMPUTED) and predicted (? PREDICTED) values of LS susceptibility is 0.928 at 0.01 level of significance. At the next stage, the LS risk is evaluated considering the ârisk trio,â i.e., the combination of the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. This stage involves the transformation of a range of qualitative datasets to the virtual workspace of machine learning. The landslide risk output has been predicted with an initial fuzzy model, incorporating a set of 32 rules for membership functions (MF). This initial model uses randomly selected 20% datasets to tailor the fuzzy rules through the adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface (ANFIS). The training to ANFIS results in framing 120 fuzzy rules for the best possible prediction of the outcome. The final LS risk map from the ANFIS output shows that more than 70% area is under high-to-very high LS risk. The model is tested in a 5? Ã 5? grid around the famous hill station Mussoorie in the state of Uttarakhand, India. The model exhibits a satisfactory level of accuracy for the present-study area, which has made us confident to recommend it. The multistage model is worthy of being applied for landslide risk mapping for the similar kinds of study areas, and also for other areas of landslide with necessary customization as deemed necessary.

Therefore, the main aim of this study is to develop a novel deep learning model namely landslide net (LSNet) to assess the landslide susceptibility in Hanyin County, China, meanwhile, support vector machine model (SVM) and kernel logistic regression model (KLR) were employed as reference model. The inventory map was generated based on 259 landslides, the training dataset and validation dataset were, respectively, prepared using 70% landslides and the remaining 30% landslides. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was applied to optimize each landslide predisposing factor. Three benchmark indices were used to evaluate the result of susceptibility mapping and area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) was used to compare the models. Result demonstrated that although the processing speed of LSNet model is the slowest, it still significantly outperformed its corresponding benchmark models with validation dataset, and has the highest accuracy (0.950), precision (0.951), F1 (0.951) and AUROC (0.941), which reflected excellent predictive ability in some degree.

This study designed a multi-hazard map for three important hazards (earthquakes, floods, and landslides) to identify endangered areas in Kermanshah province located in western Iran using ensemble SWARA-ANFIS-PSO and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO models. In the first step, flood and landslide inventory maps were generated to identify at-risk areas. Then, the occurrence places for each hazard were divided into two groups for training susceptibility models (70%) and testing the models applied (30%). Factors affecting these hazards, including altitude, slope aspect, slope degree, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to the faults, rainfall, lithology, and land use, were used to generate susceptibility maps. The SWARA method was used to weigh the subclasses of the influencing factors in floods and landslides. In addition, a peak ground acceleration (PGA) map was generated to investigate earthquakes in the study area. In the next step, the ANFIS machine learning algorithm was used in combination with PSO and GWO meta-heuristic algorithms to train the data, and SWARA-ANFIS-PSO and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO susceptibility maps were separately generated for flood and landslide hazards. The predictive ability of the implemented models was validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean square error (MSE) methods. The results showed that the SWARA-ANFIS-PSO ensemble model had the best performance in generating flood susceptibility maps with ROC = 0.936, RMS = 0.346, and MSE = 0.120. Furthermore, this model showed excellent results (ROC = 0.894, RMS = 0.410, and MSE = 0.168) for generating a landslide map. Finally, the best maps and PGA map were combined, and a multi-hazard map (MHM) was obtained for Kermanshah Province. This map can be used by managers and planners as a practical guide for sustainable development.

An effective multi-hazard risk mitigation strategy includes assessing individual hazards as well as their interactions. However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, multi-hazard susceptibility prediction techniques based on machine learning has encountered a huge bottleneck. In order to effectively solve this problem, this study proposes a multi-hazard susceptibility mapping framework using the classical deep learning algorithm of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). First, we use historical flash flood, debris flow and landslide locations based on Google Earth images, extensive field surveys, topography, hydrology, and environmental data sets to train and validate the proposed CNN method. Next, the proposed CNN method is assessed in comparison to conventional logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor methods using several objective criteria, i.e., coefficient of determination, overall accuracy, mean absolute error and the root mean square error. Experimental results show that the CNN method outperforms the conventional machine learning algorithms in predicting probability of flash floods, debris flows and landslides. Finally, the susceptibility maps of the three hazards based on CNN are combined to create a multi-hazard susceptibility map. It can be observed from the map that 62.43% of the study area are prone to hazards, while 37.57% of the study area are harmless. In hazard-prone areas, 16.14%, 4.94% and 30.66% of the study area are susceptible to flash floods, debris flows and landslides, respectively. In terms of concurrent hazards, 0.28%, 7.11% and 3.13% of the study area are susceptible to the joint occurrence of flash floods and debris flow, debris flow and landslides, and flash floods and landslides, respectively, whereas, 0.18% of the study area is subject to all the three hazards.

The landslide inventory and ten conditioning factors were first constructed, based on data availability and climate. Subsequently, three tree-based models, decision tree (DT), DT-Boosting, and random forest (RF), were established and compared with the support vector machine (SVM) to analyze the difference in model prediction. Finally, the effect and causes of tree-based algorithms on prediction results were explored based on the working mechanism of the susceptibility model. Results show that there is no multicollinearity among the conditioning factors. The predicted results produced by the tree-based model display the discontinuous distribution compared with the SVM, not only presented in the point-based prediction but the surface-based heterogeneity. Moreover, heterogeneity on the susceptibility map relates to the tree-based algorithm and factor grading, especially the classification of important factors. Besides, DT-Boosting appears the highest numerical features, with large values of AUC (0.981), specificity (0.960), sensitivity (0.956) and accuracy (0.958) in the training phase, and high prediction of AUC (0.862), specificity (0.759), sensitivity (0.843) and accuracy (0.801) in the validation phase. In terms of fluctuation, the RF is smaller than that of DT-Boosting. Further, the susceptibility map generated by RF, with the largest D-value of 7.81, can well capture the difference in landslide susceptibility.

The landslide susceptibility map (LSM) usually helps to mitigate disasters. However, how to accurately predict the susceptibility of landslides is still a difficult point in the field of disaster research. In this study, five advanced machine learning technologies (MLTs), including the Light Gradient Boosting Machine, extreme gradient boost, categorical boosting (CatBoost), support vector machine, and random forest, are utilized to landslide susceptibility modeling and their capabilities are compared through evaluation indicators. The northern part of Yanping, Fujian Province, China, is selected as the research object, because this area experienced mass landslide events due to extremely heavy rainfall in June 2010, resulting in many casualties and a large number of public facilities destroyed. The influencing factors for landslides, namely topographic, hydrological, geologic and human activities, are prepared from various data sources based on the availability. Through the analysis of the actual situation in the study area, 13 suitable landslide condition factors are considered and the availability of relevant factors is checked according to the multicollinearity test. The landslide inventory including 631 samples in this study area is obtained from historical information, satellite data in Google earth and performed field surveys. The landslide inventory is randomly divided into two datasets for model training and testing with a 7:3 ratio. The area under the curve of ROC, accuracy rate, Kappa index and F1 score are applied to compare the MLTs capabilities. In this paper, the results of factor importance analysis show that the first three important condition factors are the distance to faults, the distance to drainages and the slope. According to the LSMs, in the study area, the central and western regions are at high and very high landslide susceptibility levels, while almost all the eastern and northeastern regions are at medium and low landslide susceptibility levels. The CatBoost model is a very promising technology in landslide research according to the evaluation results, which means that for landslide susceptibility research, gradient boosting algorithms may get more accurate results and show better prospects in the future. Finally, the results of this paper will contribute to environmental protection to a certain extent.

Long-term interactions between rock uplift and river undercutting developed widely distributed landslides in this catchment, which recorded the typical tectonic geomorphology in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we examined the landslides in the Minjiang catchment and aimed to compare the prediction ability of the statistical and machine learning (ML) models in landslide susceptibility assessment. We adopted the statistical models of the frequency ratio (FR) and information value (IV) models, and the ML models represented by a logistic model tree (LMT) and radial basis function classifier (RBFC) for landslide prediction. An inventory map of 668 landslides was compiled, and the landslides were randomly divided into training (80%) and validation (20%) datasets. Furthermore, 11 control factors of landslides based on topography, geology, hydrology, and other environments were applied for the analysis. The comprehensive performance of the four models was validated and compared using accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results indicated that both sides of the valley along the Mingjiang and Heishuihe Rivers are in the high and very high susceptibility zones; in particular, the river segment from Wenchuan to Maoxian County has the highest susceptibility. The AUC values of the FR, IV, LMT, and RBFC models with the training data were 0.842, 0.862, 0.898, and 0.894, respectively, while the validation dataset illustrated the highest AUC value of 0.879 in the LMT model, followed by the RBFC (0.871), IV (0.869), and FR (0.839) models. Moreover, the LMT and RBFC models had higher accuracy values than the FR and IV models. This suggests that the ML models are superior to the statistical models in generating adequate landslide susceptibility maps, and the LMT model is the most efficient one for landslide prediction in the study region.

This concept is widely known as landslide susceptibility. And, it has seen a vast improvement from old bivariate statistical techniques to modern deep learning routines. Despite all these advancements, no spatially-explicit data-driven model is currently capable of also predicting how large landslides may be once they trigger in a specific study area. In this work, we exploit a model architecture that has already found a number of applications in landslide susceptibility. Specifically, we opt for the use of Neural Networks. But, instead of focusing exclusively on where landslides may occur, we extend this paradigm to also spatially predict classes of landslide sizes. As a result, we keep the traditional binary classification paradigm but we make use of it to complement the susceptibility estimates with a crucial information for landslide hazard assessment. We will refer to this model as Hierarchical Neural Network (HNN) throughout the manuscript. To test this analytical protocol, we use the Nepalese area where the Gorkha earthquake induced tens of thousands of landslides on the 25th of April 2015. The results we obtain are quite promising. The component of our HNN that estimates the susceptibility outperforms a binomial Generalized Linear Model (GLM) baseline we used as benchmark. We did this for a GLM represents the most common classifier in the landslide literature. Most importantly, our HNN also suitably performed across the entire procedure. As a result, the landslide-area-class prediction returned not just a single susceptibility map, as per tradition. But, it also produced several informative maps on the expected landslide size classes. Our vision is for administrations to consult these suite of model outputs and maps to better assess the risk to local communities and infrastructure. And, to promote the diffusion of our HNN, we are sharing the data and codes in a githubsec repository in the hope that we would stimulate others to replicate similar analyses.

As a result, the present study intends to assess the effect of future landslide on different ecosystem services in Aqabat Al-Sulbat regions. In the present study, landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) at different return periods as a proxy of future landslide have been generated with integration of ensemble machine learning algorithms. Stacking framework based on bagging, dagging, and artificial neural network (ANN) along with random forest has been proposed to generate LSMs. Also, bagging, dagging, and ANN have been applied individually. Receiver operational characteristics (ROC curve)Â were used to validate the LSM model against reality. The best LSM predicting model determined by the ROC curve was used to create future LSM maps by combining rainfall at 2â100Â year return periods (using Gumble extreme value distribution). The potential loss of ecosystem services value in the Aqabat Al-Sulbat region was estimated. All models anticipate 6â16Â km2 and 27â41Â km2 of the study region as very high and high land susceptibility (LS) zones, respectively. According to the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve, stacking-bagging outperformed all other models (AUC: 0.91). While the region encompassed by very high LS zones would steadily rise from 2 to 100Â year return periods (6.1â20.44Â km2). As a result, ecosystem services (ES) would be destroyed as well. The results revealed that the ES generating region with zero value will steadily expand with increasing return periods (39â42Â km2) owing to the expansion of high LS zones.

Landslide susceptibility mapping is an essential tool for predicting landslides and mitigating landslide-associated damage in areas prone to these events. This study aims to investigate the combination of using an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with metaheuristic optimization algorithms: gray wolf optimizer (GWO), particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) in mapping landslide potential. The study area was Pyeongchang-gun, South Korea, for which an accurate landslide inventory dataset is available. A landslide inventory map was organized, and the data were separated randomly into training data (70%) and validation data (30%). In addition, 16 landslide-related factors consisting of geo-environmental and topo-hydrological factors were considered as predictive variables. This landslide susceptibility model was be evaluated based on the value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) to measure its accuracy. Based on the maps, the validation results showed that the optimized models of ANFIS-ICA, ANFIS-PSO, and ANFIS-GWO had AUC accuracies of 0.927, 0.947, and 0.968, respectively. The result from the hybrid algorithms model of ANFIS with metaheuristic algorithms outperformed the standalone ANFIS model in terms of accuracy in predicting landslide potential. Therefore, the ML algorithm and optimization algorithm models proposed in this study are more suitable for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area.

Previous studies have shown that no single model performs best across diverse geoenvironmental conditions. To seek better prediction accuracy and reliability, this study proposes three different ensemble methods to take advantage of multiple landslide susceptibility models: qualitative matrix ensemble method, semi-quantitative partition ensemble method, and quantitative probability-weighted ensemble method. To illustrate the effectiveness of the three ensemble methods proposed, a case study is carried out in Fengjie County in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China. First, with the support of geographic information system, a total of 1550 historical landslides and the associated 12 conditioning factors are compiled, which are used for the training and validation of four selected single landslide susceptibility models, including two statistical approaches (i.e. frequency ratio and fuzzy assessment) and two machine learning approaches (i.e. backpropagation neural network and support vector machine). Then, the three ensemble methods are applied to integrate the outcomes of the four single models. Finally, an extensive comparative analysis is performed between the ensemble methods and single models using the receiver operating characteristics curve and information entropy. The results demonstrate that all the three ensemble methods achieve higher overall prediction accuracy (> 80%) than the four single models (< 80%), and the matrix ensemble method provides the best improvement. Besides, the ensemble methods can also enhance reliability by reducing the statistical discrepancy between distinct single models.

Therefore, it is of great significance to build a collapse and landslide susceptibility evaluation model in Wenchuan County for local disaster prevention and mitigation. Taking Wenchuan County as the research object and according to the data of 1081 historical collapse and landslide disaster points, as well as the natural environment, this paper first selects six categories of environmental factors (13 environmental factors in total) including topography (slope, aspect, curva-ture, terrain relief, TWI), geological structure (lithology, soil type, distance to fault), meteorology and hydrology (rainfall, distance to river), seismic impact (PGA), ecological impact (NDVI), and impact of human activity (land use). It then builds three single models (LR, SVM, RF) and three CF-based hybrid models (CF-LR, CF-SVM, CF-RF), and makes a comparative analysis of the accuracy and reliability of the models, thereby obtaining the optimal model in the research area. Finally, this study discusses the contribution of environmental factors to the collapse and the landslide susceptibility prediction of the optimal model. The research results show that (1) the areas prone to extremely high collapse and landslide predicted by the six models (LR, CF-LR, SVM, CF-SVM, RF and CF-RF) have an area of 730.595 km2, 377.521 km2, 361.772 km2, 372.979 km2, 318.631 km2, and 306.51 km2, respectively, and the frequency ratio precision of collapses and landslides is 0.916, 0.938, 0.955, 0.956, 0.972, and 0.984, respectively; (2) the ranking of the comprehensive index based on the confusion matrix is CF-RF&gt;RF&gt;CF-SVM&gt;CF-LR&gt;SVM&gt;LR and the ranking of the AUC value is CF-RF&gt;RF&gt;CF-SVM&gt;CF-LR&gt;SVM&gt;LR.

Most of the recent publications focused on quantitative analysis, i.e., improving data processing methods, comparing and perfecting the data-driven model itself, but rarely taking the qualitative aspects of the local landslide occurrences into consideration and the further analysis of the key features was always lacking. This study aims to combine qualitative and quantitative analysis and examine its effect on mapping accuracy; based on the feature importance ranks and the related literature, the key features for identifying landslide/non-landslide points of different sub-zones were further analyzed. Before modeling, the study area Yunyang County, Chongqing City, China, was manually divided into four sub-zones based on the information from geological hazards explo-ration in Chongqing, including the mechanism of landslide formation and sliding failure and geo-morphic unit characteristics. Upon the qualitative analysis basis, five grid searches tuned random forest models (one for the whole region and four for the sub-zones independently) were established by 1654 data points and 20 conditioning features. Compared with the conventional data-driven method, the integrated quantitative evaluation based on the qualitative analysis results showed higher reliability, which not only improved the mapping accuracy but also increased the AUC val-ues of all four sub-models, which were 8.8%, 2.3%, 1.9% and 9.1% higher than that of the parent model. Moreover, the quantitative evaluation based on the qualitative analysis revealed the key factors affecting local landslide formation. Therefore, qualitative analysis is recommended in future landslide susceptibility modeling with the additional combination of data-driven methods. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Seventeen landslide influential causative factors (LICFs) were used, which included slope, aspect, elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), terrain ruggedness index (TRI), drainage density, distance to drainage, seismic zone, soil texture, geology, and land use and land cover (LULC). The machine learning (ML) neural network and deep learning models, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), artificial neural network (ANN), deep learning neural network (DLNN), and Getis-Ord GI*, have been applied for landslide susceptibility (LS) maps, and earthquake and landslide hotspot maps respectively of the Himalayas. The LS maps were compared with the earthquake and landslide hotspot zones, and there is valid agreement among these. The results of the susceptibility mapping were validated by the confusion matrix table and sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precession, F score, and kappa statistical indices. The validation result showed that all the landslide susceptibility models (LSMs) have a near 90% prediction rate. Among the four models, the DLNN models have the highest prediction accuracy followed by LDA, QDA, and ANN.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in deep learning have been successfully applied to LSM studies and have been shown to improve the accuracy of LSM. Although optimizing the quality of negative samples at the input step of a deep learning model can improve the accuracy of the model, the risk of model overfitting may increase. In this study, an LSM method based on the Gaussian heatmap sampling technique and a CNN was developed from the perspective of LSM dataset sampling. A Gaussian heatmap sampling technique was used to enrich the variety of landslide inventory at the input step of the deep learning model to improve the accuracy of the LSM results. This sampling technique involved the construction of a landslide susceptibility Gaussian heatmap neural network model, LSGH-Net, by combining a CNN. A series of optimization strategies such as attention mechanism, dropout, etc., were applied to improve the model structure and training process. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach outperformed the benchmark CNN-based algorithm in terms of metrics (Accuracy = 95.30%, F1 score = 95.13%, and Sensitivity = 91.79%). The Gaussian heatmap sampling technique effectively improved the accuracy of frequency histograms of the landslide susceptibility index, which provided finer-grained mapping details and more reasonable landslide density. By analyzing Gaussian heatmap at different scales, the approach proposed in this paper is an important reference for different regions and other disaster susceptibility studies as well.

In some cases, the complex behaviors of some such phenomena cause that single machine learning models fail in modeling them well. To overcome this issue, this paper presents two novel genetic-algorithm (GA)-based ensemble models constructed with the decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB) models based on the bagging and random sub-space (RS) methods for landslide susceptibility assessment and mapping in Ajloun and Jerash governorates in Jordan. Sixteen factors, including topographic, climatic, human, and geological factors were used as possible factors that influence landslide occurrence in the study area. In addition to this, one hundred and ninety two landslide locations were employed for training and testing the models. The GA was used in this study for feature selection based on three models: DT, KNN, and NB. Model performance evaluation based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve indicated that the ensemble models outperform the standalone ones. The values of the AUROC curves in the validation phases for the five models, namely, the GA-based DT, KNN, NB, bagging-based, and RS-based ensemble model, were 0.63, 0.69, 0.63, 0.89, and 0.95, respectively.

The development of urbanisation has led to the expansion of residential areas in mountainous areas, and human activities have accelerated slope instability. However, the limited data records in mountainous zones have resulted in low-precision landslide rainfall thresholds. Establishing a landslide early warning model in areas with scarce data is an unresolved problem. This study uses the Bailong River Basin in western China as an example. By downscaling Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data to a daily resolution of 1 km and conditionally merging it with ground station rainfall, we obtain high-precision rainfall data to establish rainfall threshold curves based on Bayes' theorem and the frequency method. Subsequently, a landslide susceptibility map based on deep learning was integrated to construct a regional landslide early warning model. The results are as follows: First, compared with downscaling rainfall and rain gauge interpolation data, the daily rainfall data with a resolution of 1 km that combines the two has better overall performance and higher accuracy. Second, we generated the event-rainfall-and-duration threshold curves of 5%, 20%, and 50% probability by combining the frequency method and Bayesian theorem, and show that with a probability of landslide occurrence of 50%, while the intercept of Bayes' theorem is greater than that of the frequency method, the overall trend is consistent. Finally, by using a typical mass rainfall event to test the performance, the results show that the early warning capability of the model integrated with the rainfall threshold and landslide susceptibility map is more accurate than that of using a separate rainfall threshold. The outcomes of this research are expected to provide efficient support for early warning and risk management of geological disasters in mountainous areas with scarce data.

The existing research has not fully consid-ered the potential impact of the spatial agglomeration and dispersion of landslides on assessments. This issue may cause a systematic evaluation bias when the field investigation data are insufficient, which is common due to limited human resources. Accordingly, this paper proposes two novel strate-gies, including a clustering algorithm and a preprocessing method, for these two ignored features to strengthen assessments, especially in high-susceptibility regions. Multiple machine learning models are compared in a case study of the city of Bijie (Guizhou Province, China). Then we generate the optimal susceptibility map and conduct two experiments to test the validity of the proposed methods. The primary conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) random forest (RF) was superior to other algorithms in the recognition of high-susceptibility areas and the portrayal of local spatial features; (2) the susceptibility map incorporating spatial feature messages showed a noticeable improvement over the spatial distribution and gradual change of susceptibility, as well as the accurate delineation of critical hazardous areas and the interpretation of historical hazards; and (3) the spatial distribution feature had a significant positive effect on modeling, as the accuracy increased by 5% and 10% after including the spatial agglomeration and dispersion consideration in the RF model, respectively. The benefit of the agglomeration is concentrated in high-susceptibility areas, and our work provides insight to improve the assessment accuracy in these areas, which is critical to risk assessment and prevention activities.

The study investigated the importance of the conditioning factors in predicting landslide occurrences using the mentioned models. In this paper, we evaluated the importance of the conditioning factors in the overall prediction capabilities of the statistical and ML algorithms. By the trial-and-error method, we eliminated the least ""important""features by using a common threshold of 0.30 for statistical and 0.03 for ML algorithms. Conclusively, we found that removing the least important features does not impact the overall accuracy of LSM for all three models. Based on the results of our study, the most commonly available features, for example, the topographic features, contributes to comparable results after removing the least important ones, namely the aspect plan and profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic roughness index (TRI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the case of the statistical model and the plan and profile curvature, TWI, and topographic position index (TPI) for ML algorithms.

RF algorithm showed the best performance; therefore, hybridized genetic random forest (GRF) was employed in order to optimize the hyperparameters (number of trees, number splits and depth) of the model, which can affect the performance of model. As a result, GRF has best performance among all mentioned algorithms with AUC = 0.93. As a conclusion, genetic algorithm was found to be suitable in optimizing the performance of machine learning algorithms, which is crucial when it comes to landslide susceptibility mapping.

In northern Pakistan, landslides due to vigorous seismic zones, monsoon rainfall, extremely sheer slopes, and unfavorable geological conditions present a considerable threat to the mountain areas. This study targets and advances the research in mapping landslide susceptibility in northern Pakistan (Mansehra and Muzaffarabad districts). The central objective of the analysis is to analyze different convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks and residual network (ResNet) that were constructed by developing distinct data representation algorithms for landslide susceptibility assessment and compare the results. This study considers sixteen landslide conditioning factors related to the incident of landslides centered on the literature review and geologic attributes of the pondered area. The marked historical landslide positions in the deliberated area were arbitrarily split into training and testing datasets, with the earlier containing 70% and the former having 30% of the total datasets. Several commonly exploited measures were used to validate the CNN architectures and ResNet by comparing them with the most prevalent machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The outcomes of this study revealed that the proportions of regions having very high susceptibility in all the landslide susceptibility maps of the ResNet model and CNN models are considerably alike and less than 20%, which implies that the CNN models are significantly helpful in managing and preventing landslides as to the orthodox techniques. Moreover, the suggested CNN architectures and ResNet attained greater or similar prediction accuracy than other orthodox ML and DL techniques. The values of OA (overall accuracy) and MCC (Matthewâs correlation coefficient) of proposed CNNs and ResNet were greater than those of the optimized SVM (support vector machine) and DNN (deep neural network).

The need to initially specify the number of clusters, difficulty in handling noise and quantifying rainfall data, limits the application of traditional clustering models in landslide susceptibility assessment which then lowers their performance accuracy. Thus, to overcome these limitations, this study proposed an improved clustering algorithm titled the DBSCAN-AHD algorithm, which combines the traditional DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise) algorithm and an Adaptive Hausdorff Distance (AHD) for landslide susceptibility modeling. Firstly, AHD was introduced to the traditional DBSCAN to quantify rainfall. Then, the DBSCAN-AHD grouped the mapping units with similar topology and geology characteristics into subclasses without specifying the number of clusters in advance for its ability to handle noise in the data. Furthermore, the LD-EV (landslide density or eigenvalues) approach was introduced to obtain the susceptibility levels using K-means algorithm. Finally, to verify the modelâs performance, statistical indices and the area under the curve (AUC) were applied and compared to the traditional DBSCAN, KPSO, K-means and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms, whereby, the proposed model outperformed the others.

However, this increased performance is often accompanied by increased model complexity and decreased interpretability, resulting in critiques of their âblack boxâ nature, which highlights the need for algorithms that can offer both strong predictive performance and interpretability. This is especially true when the global model and predictions for specific data points need to be explainable in order for the model to be of use. Explainable boosting machines (EBM), an augmentation and refinement of generalize additive models (GAMs), has been proposed as an empirical modeling method that offers both interpretable results and strong predictive performance. The trained model can be graphically summarized as a set of functions relating each predictor variable to the dependent variable along with heat maps representing interactions between selected pairs of predictor variables. In this study, we assess EBMs for predicting the likelihood or probability of slope failure occurrence based on digital terrain characteristics in four separate Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) in the state of West Virginia, USA and compare the results to those obtained with LR, kNN, RF, and SVM. EBM provided predictive accuracies comparable to RF and SVM and better than LR and kNN. The generated functions and visualizations for each predictor variable and included interactions between pairs of predictor variables, estimation of variable importance based on average mean absolute scores, and provided scores for each predictor variable for new predictions add interpretability, but additional work is needed to quantify how these outputs may be impacted by variable correlation, inclusion of interaction terms, and large feature spaces. Further exploration of EBM is merited for geohazard mapping and modeling in particular and spatial predictive mapping and modeling in general, especially when the value or use of the resulting predictions would be greatly enhanced by improved interpretability globally and availability of prediction explanations at each cell or aggregating unit within the mapped or modeled extent.

To this end, 10 landslide disaster-related variables including digital elevation model (DEM)-derived, meteorology-derived, Landsat8-derived, geology-derived, and human activities factors were provided. Of 345 landslide disaster locations found, 70% were used to train the models, and the rest of them were performed for model verification. The aforementioned four models were run, and landslide susceptibility evaluation maps were produced. Then, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, statistical analysis, and field investigation were performed to test and verify the efficiency of these models. Analysis and comparison of the results denoted that all four landslide models performed well for the landslide susceptibility evaluation as indicated by the area under curve (AUC) values of ROC curves from 0.863 to 0.934. Among them, it has been shown that the PSO-RF model has the highest accuracy in comparison to other landslide models, followed by the PSO-SVM model, the RF model, and the SVM model. Moreover, the results also showed that the PSO algorithm has a good effect on SVM and RF models. Furthermore, the landslide models devolved in the present study are promising methods that could be transferred to other regions for landslide susceptibility evaluation.

The AHC-OLID algorithm is proposed to combat the limitations of many clustering algorithms in modelling and assessing landslide susceptibility, including: pre-defining the number of clusters; sensitivity to the clusters properties and noisy data; as well as difficulty in processing rainfall data. The proposed algorithm addresses these issues by integrating the traditional Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) and Overlapped Interval Divergence distance measure (OLID) methods into landslide susceptibility assessment to enhance its performance. It considers the clusters sizes as well the distances between them and tends to avoid taking into consideration small clusters which are very far from other clusters in the dataset. It is also insensitive to the variation in sizes, variances and shapes of the clusters, which makes the algorithm more advantageous. Besides, the AHC-OLID algorithm makes use of the OLID distance function to process the rainfall data, which takes two factors into consideration: distance between their centers as well as relative size of their overlapped area. Applying this new approach in Baota District, China, produced significant improvement in assessment of landslide susceptibility than previous models. Moreover, the Landslide susceptibility map constructed based on AHC-OLID algorithm can be a useful tool for landslide controlling strategies for proper land use and planning.

Landslides occur in hilly and mountainous areas all over the world. Single, ensemble, and hybrid machine learning (ML) models have been used in landslide studies for better landslide susceptibility mapping and risk management. In the present study, we have used three single ML models, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), and radial basis function network (RBFN), for landslide susceptibility mapping at Pithoragarh district, as these models are easy to apply and so far they have not been used for landslide study in this area. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of these single models for correctly identifying landslide susceptible zones for their further application in other areas. For this, ten important landslide affecting factors, namely, slope, aspect, curvature, elevation, land cover, lithology, geomorphology, distance to rivers, distance to roads, and overburden depth based on the local geoenvironmental conditions, were considered for the modeling. Landslide inventory of past 398 landslide events was used in the development of models. The data of past landslide events (locations) was randomly divided into a 70/30 ratio for training (70%) and validation (30%) of the models. Standard statistical measures, namely, accuracy (ACC), specificity (SPF), sensitivity (SST), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), Kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results indicated that the performance of all the models is very good (AUC > 0.90) and that of the LR model is the best (AUC = 0.926). Therefore, these single ML models can be used for the development of accurate landslide susceptibility maps. Our study demonstrated that the single models which are easy to use and can compete with the complex ensemble/hybrid models can be applied for landslide susceptibility mapping in landslide-prone areas.

Generally, it takes high effort to populate a landslide inventory with relevant data. In this context, the present work investigated an effective way to handle vast amounts of automatically acquired digital data for landslide inventories by the use of machine learning algorithms and information filtering. Between July 2017 and February 2019, a keyword alert system provided 4381 documents that were automatically processed to detect landslide events in Germany. Of all those documents, 91% were automatically recognized as irrelevant or duplicates; thereby, the data volume was significantly reduced to contain only actual landslide documents. Moreover, it was shown that inclusion of the documentâs images into the automated process chain for information filtering is recommended, since otherwise unobtainable important information was found in them. Compared with manual methods, the automated process chain eliminated personal idiosyncrasies and human error and replaced it with a quantifiable machine error. The applied individual algorithms for natural language processing, information retrieval, and classification have been tried and tested in their respective fields. Furthermore, the proposed method is not restricted to a specific language or region. All languages on which these algorithms are applicable can be used with the proposed method and the training of the process chain can take any geographical restriction into account.

Wildfires weaken the shear strength of the soil, forming a layer of soil that is vulnerable to landslides. It is important to identify the severity of a wildfire as well as the burned area to sustainably manage the forest. Although satellite remote sensing has been widely used to map wildfire severity, it is often difficult to determine the severity using only the temporal change of satellite-derived indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). In this study, we proposed an approach for determining wildfire severity based on machine learning through the synergistic use of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar-C data and Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument data. Three wildfire cases-Samcheok in May 2017, Gangreung Â· Donghae in April 2019, and Gosung Â· Sokcho in April 2019-were used for developing wildfire severity mapping models with three machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine). The results showed that the random forest model yielded the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy of 82.3%. The cross-site validation to examine the spatiotemporal transferability of the machine learning models showed that the models were highly sensitive to temporal differences between the training and validation sites, especially in the early growing season. This implies that a more robust model with high spatiotemporal transferability can be developed when more wildfire cases with different seasons and areas are added in the future.

Numerous studies and methods have been published on this subject; however, these methods are difficult to apply in the real world because they are mainly based on remotely sensed landslides from a single sensor with a specific spatial resolution. Additionally, models built within deep learning frameworks tend to adopt similar encoder-decoder network structures, wherein many landslide features are easily filtered out by continuous convolutions. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deconvolution network to detect landslides. The model enlarges input feature maps by a deconvolution operation and convolutes the enlarged feature maps to learn to detect landslides. Moreover, the hierarchical structure enables the proposed network to better synthesize landslide features at a higher spatial resolution. An attention module is also proposed to enhance multiscale landslide features.

To mimic practical applications, the trained model is evaluated over three areas that recently experienced landslides.

In collaboration with the Asian Disasters Preparedness Center and NASA's SERVIR Programme, we are regionalizing the global Landslide Hazard Assessment System for Situational Awareness model for the LMR (LHASA-Mekong). A robust set of landslide inventories are needed to effectively train the machine learning-based LHASA-Mekong model. In this study, the Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection (SALaD) system was modified by incorporating a change detection module (SALaD-CD) to produce rainfall event-based landslide inventories using pre- and post-imagery from RapidEye and PlanetScope for various locations in the LMR that were identified based on media and government reports. These rainfall-induced landslides are published as initiation points for ease of use. In total, we created 22 inventories: 2 in Laos, 4 in Myanmar, 1 in Thailand and 15 in Vietnam. These inventories are being used to train the LHASA-Mekong model and quantify the effects of Land use/Land cover change on landslide susceptibility. These open data will be a valuable resource for advancing landslide studies in this region.",GEOSCIENCE DATA JOURNAL,10.1002/gdj3.145,5,1,No,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we consider a more realistic and practical setting for large-scale heterogeneous landslide data collection and DL-based labeling. In this setting, remotely sensed images are collected sequentially in temporal batches, where each batch focuses on images from a particular ecoregion, but different batches can focus on different ecoregions with distinct landscape characteristics. For such a scenario, we study the following questions: (1) How well do DL models trained in homogeneous regions perform when they are transferred to different ecoregions? (2) Does increasing the spatial coverage in the data improve model performance in a given ecoregion? and (3) Can a landslide pixel labeling model be incrementally updated with new data, but without access to the old data and without losing performance on the old data? We address these questions by developing a mechanism for incremental training of semantic segmentation models. We call the resulting extension task-specific model updates (TSMU). A national compilation of landslide inventories by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) was used to develop a global database for this study. Our results indicate that the TSMU framework can be used to aid in the creation of new landslide inventories or expanding existing datasets, and also to rapidly develop hazard maps for situational awareness following a widespread landslide event.",IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING,10.1109/jstars.2022.3177025,1,1,No,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work has been accomplished through field investigations and analysis of field data. While commonly, studies in India lay emphasis on the geological aspects and anthropogenic factors associated with landslides, the present work intended to study in detail the hydrological aspects of the disaster, which wreaked havoc in the region characterised by deep soils, very heavy rainfall and a dense vegetation cover. All the slides of significant magnitude along a 25-km stretch of the Payaswini valley, draining the western slopes of the Madikeri hill range, were identified, and their land characteristics delineated using field surveys and maps. Soil characteristics of the region were determined through tests on samples collected from ten slide sites. Results from tests on texture, density and permeability were used to learn about the part played by subsurface water. Characteristics of rainfall during the year were investigated using field data from the worst affected region. Studies on progress of the Monsoon rain, an analysis of probability of extreme values and establishment of intensity-duration relationships were accomplished. A variable source area watershed model incorporating MODFLOW, the popular ground water flow simulation model, has been applied on a typical micro-catchment in order to study the growth of the saturated zone during rains. It has been inferred from the investigations that an unprecedented combination of extremely wet catchment and a very heavy spell of rainfall, rather than any commonly attributed factor, has been the primary cause of the disaster in the district. It is concluded that it would be a futile exercise working on this natural phenomenon devoid of extensive field studies, because of the uniqueness of the region.",LANDSLIDES,10.1007/s10346-020-01589-y,2,1,No,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data were gathered through a series of open available reports obtained from different government and institutional sources. Afterwards, data consolidation and summarization were carried out using Excel and Python. The datasets include 9 types of disaster, such as flash floods, landslides and droughts, and the corresponding number of affected people during an 18-year or a 218-month observation period for 5,402 Brazilian municipalities, totaling more than 65,0 0 0 observations. Data on relevant geographical, demographic and socioeconomic aspects of the affected municipalities are also provided. These encompass geographic coordinates, regions, population, income, development indicators, amongst other information. From a statistical point of view, the data on disasters can address a number of applications using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as, for time series analysis or other dynamic models using socioeconomic data as explanatory variables, i.e. data on the size of the poor population, income, education and gen eral development. The geographic dataset can be useful for aggregating analyses concerning the various forms of territorial organization and allows for the visualization of data in maps. All the aforementioned data can be also used to devise realistic optimization instances related to diverse humanitarian logistics and/or disaster management problems, such as facility location, location-allocation, vehicle routing, and so forth. In particular, we describe two real-world instances for the location-allocation problem studied in [1]. For that purpose, we partially use the given datasets and included other information such as costs and distances relevant to the optimization model. Although using real-world cases to test optimization approaches is a common and encouraged practice in Operations Research, comprehensive datasets and practical optimization instances, as presented in this article, are rarely described and/or available in the academic literature.

There has been a rapid increase in studies to identify ground dynamics in areas with the potential for landslides. Landslide susceptibility maps are created using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms based on geographic information systems to identify possible failures in selected areas. The aim of this study is to train different spatial data with machine learning algorithms to determine susceptible landslide areas, so as to analyze soil properties with the Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) method, which is a fundamental shallow surface seismic surveying method in geophysical engineering. Also Refraction Microtremor (Re-Mi) method applied in some stations to detect shear wave velocity (V s) up to engineering bedrock level. Obtained velocity values of soil layers from different seismic methods and historical records were used together to train the model. The seismic surveying results were used for the first time to train the machine learning algorithms to detect high susceptible areas for landslides. Some of the MASW applications were carried out in landslide areas and others in areas considered to be risky. Thus, with the contribution of the seismic method, the dynamic behavior that may occur was analyzed. All the measurements carried out in the Girne (Kyrenia) Mountains terrane. Consequently, it has been determined that the northeast-facing slopes of the Girne Mountains are the highest sensitivity for landslide, in other words, the most active in terms of ground dynamics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",International Journal of Geosynthetics and Ground Engineering,10.1007/s40891-023-00471-w,1,1,Yes,"SVM,RF",,Turkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, Muchuan County was selected as the study area, and four well-known machine learning models were adopted, namely, rotation forest (RF), J48 decision tree (J48), alternating decision tree (ADTree) and random forest (RaF). They and their ensembles (RF-J48, RF-ADTree and RF-RaF) were applied to landslide spatial prediction in Muchuan County. Eleven landslide conditioning factors, including plan curvature, profile curvature, slope angle, elevation, topographic wetness index, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, soil, lithology, distance to roads and distance to rivers, were established. In addition, 279 landslide datasets were compiled and randomly divided into 195 landslide training datasets and 84 landslide verification datasets. The contributions of the eleven conditioning factors were analyzed by J48, ADTree, and RaF models, respectively. The results show that lithology, slope angle, elevation, land use, soil, and distance to roads were the six principal landslide conditioning factors. Then, the Jenks natural break method was used to divide the landslide susceptibility maps into five grades. In addition, the accuracy of the above six models was verified by implementing the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The RF-RaF model achieved the best performance, and the rest were ranked as follows: RF-ADTree model, RaF model, RF-J48 model, ADTree model and J48 model.

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) was widely used in landslide prediction. The former research focused on the algorisms to improve its accuracy, which is relatively complete and left little room for further improvement. In this paper, new factors, including RQD and numerical simulation (NS), are selected to solve the limitation of traditional LSM on the integrity and stress state of the slope. The RQD value was obtained by machine learning and converted into rasters by the ordinary Kriging interpolation method. The slope stress was calculated by the finite difference method and converted into raster data using a program written by Fish language. Based on the information value (INV) method, gradient boosting decision tree (GDBT) was used as the main algorism to generate the LSM-NS. Finally, because LSM-NS contains landslides that have already occurred and those in high susceptibility due to its stress state, commonly used validation methods such as AUROC could no longer be used. Multiple validation methods were applied, such as stress monitoring and UAV tilt photography. The result indicates that the stress increases with crack generating in the high susceptibility area of LSM-NS, where traditional LSM could not predict. Therefore, the addition of RQD and NS could further improve the accuracy using existing algorism. LSM-NS is recommended as the more suitable model for landslide susceptibility assessment in a small area due to its excellent accuracy and efficiency. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment,10.1007/s10064-023-03250-z,1,1,No,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the potential uncertainty of susceptibility changes in mountain environments due to different precipitation thresholds related to climate change, it becomes important to evaluate these changes. In this study, we employed a machine learning approach (logistic models) to assess susceptibility changes to landslides in the Central Andes. We integrated geomorphological features such as slope and slope curvature, and precipitation data on different days before the landslide. We then split the data into a calibration and validation database in a 50/50% ratio, respectively. The results showed an area under the curve (AUC) performance of over 0.790, indicating the model’s capacity to represent prone-landslide changes based on geomorphological and precipitation antecedents. We further evaluated susceptibility changes using different precipitation scenarios by integrating Intensity/Duration/Frequency (IDF) products based on CHIRPS data. We concluded that this methodology could be implemented as a Rainfall-Induced Landslides Early Warning System (RILEWS) to forecast RIL occurrence zones and constrain precipitation thresholds. Our study estimates that half of the basin area in the study zone showed a 59% landslide probability for a return of two years at four hours. Given the extent and high population in the area, authorities must increase monitoring over unstable slopes or generate landslide early warning at an operational scale to improve risk management. We encourage decision-makers to focus on better understanding and analysing short-duration extreme events, and future urbanization and public infrastructure designs must consider RIL impact. © 2023 by the authors.",Water (Switzerland),10.3390/w15142514,1,1,Yes,LOGR,,Chile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the extremely difficult problem of automatic forested landslide detection, airborne remote sensing technologies, such as LiDAR and optical cameras, can obtain more accurate landslide monitoring data. In practice, however, airborne LiDAR data and optical images are treated independently. The complementary information of the remote sensing data from multiple sources has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this deficiency, we investigate how to use LiDAR data and optical images together to develop an automatic detection model for forested landslide detection. First, a new dataset for detecting forested landslides in the Jiuzhaigou earthquake region is compiled. LiDAR-derived DEM and hillshade maps are used to mitigate the influence of forest cover on the detection of forested landslides. Second, a new deep learning model called DemDet is proposed for the automatic detection of forested landslides. In the feature extraction component of DemDet, a self-supervised learning module is proposed for extracting geometric features from LiDAR-derived DEM. Additionally, a transformer-based deep neural network is proposed for identifying landslides from hillshade maps and optical images. In the data fusion component of DemDet, an attention-based neural network is proposed to combine DEM, hillshade, and optical images. DemDet is able to extract key features from hillshade images, optical images, and DEM, as demonstrated by experimental results on the proposed dataset. In comparison to ResUNet, LandsNet, HRNet, MLP, and SegFormer, DemDet obtains the highest mean accuracy, mIoU, and F1 values, namely 0.95, 0.67, and 0.777. DemDet is therefore capable of autonomously identifying the forest-covered landslides in the Jiuzhaigou earthquake zone.

The intrinsic vulnerability of settlements, due to poverty and poor governance, as well as the lack of tools for urban occupation planning and mitigation protocols, has made such impacts particularly severe. Cuenca (Ecuador) is a significant example of a city that in recent decades has experienced considerable population growth (i.e. exposure) and an associated increase in loss due to landslide occurrence. Despite such effects, updated urban planning tools are absent, so an evaluation of multitemporal exposure to landslides and related risks is required. In this perspective, a potential urban planning tool is presented based on updated data depicting the spatial distribution of landslides and their predisposing factors, as well as population change between 2010 and 2020. In addition, a multitemporal analysis accounting for changes in exposure between 2010 and 2020 and an estimation of relative landside risk was carried out. Due to the absence of spatially distributed population data, energy supply contract data have been used as a proxy of the population. The results show that the current higher exposure and related relative risk are estimated for parishes (parroquias) located in the southern sector of the study area (i.e. Turi, Santa Ana, Tarqui, Nulti, Baños and Paccha). Moreover, the exposure multitemporal analysis indicates that most parishes located in the hilly areas bounding the city centre (i.e. Sayausi, San Joaquin, Tarqui, Sidcay, Baños, Ricaurte, Paccha and Chiquintad) are experiencing sustained population growth and will be potentially exposed to an increased risk with a consistently growing trend. The obtained relative risk map can be considered a valuable tool for guiding land planning, land management, occupation restriction and early warning strategy adoption in the area. The methodological approach used, which accounts for landslide susceptibility and population variation through proxy data analysis, has the potential to be applied in a similar context of growing population cities in low- to mid-income countries, where data usually needed for a comprehensive landslide risk analysis are non-existing or only partially available. © 2023, The Author(s).",Landslides,10.1007/s10346-023-02065-z,1,1,Yes,MENT,,"Italy,Ecuador",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the significant progress in LSM research over the past two decades, several long-standing issues, such as uncertainties related to training samples and model selection, remain inadequately addressed in the literature. In this study, we employed a physically based susceptibility model, PISA-m, to generate four different non-landslide data scenarios and combine them with mapped landslides from Magoffin County, Kentucky, for model training. We utilized two Bayesian network model structures, Naïve Bayes (NB) and Tree-Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN), to produce LSMs based on regional geomorphic conditions. After internal validation, we evaluated the robustness and reliability of the models using an independent landslide inventory from Owsley County, Kentucky. The results revealed considerable differences between the most effective model in internal validation (AUC = 0.969), which used non-landslide samples extracted exclusively from low susceptibility areas predicted by PISA-m, and the models’ unsatisfactory performance in external validation, as manifested by the identification of only 79.1% of landslide initiation points as high susceptibility areas. The obtained results from both internal and external validation highlighted the potential overfitting problem, which has largely been overlooked by previous studies. Additionally, our findings also indicate that TAN models consistently outperformed NB models when training datasets were the same due to the ability to account for variables’ dependencies by the former. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15123200,1,1,Yes,NB,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study is to find whether classification algorithms of machine learning are suitable for obtaining safety factor based on a high-risk-area (HRA) model, composed of eight geotechnical properties. Each property value is designated as an input value for machine learning, and the output value is determined as a safety factor. The data are transformed into continuous data after preprocessing with label encoding since the data have a discontinuous pattern. The DT, KNN, LR, RF, and SVM algorithms are selected to perform the classification with train and validation ratio of 7:3. To improve the reliability of the results, the classification is also performed after applying the PCA technique, which can reduce eight dimensions to two principal components. In addition, the number of data is equally oversampled using the SMOTE technique to solve the data imbalance problem for each class, and the results of classification are also compared. The PCA shows a limited ability to reflect the characteristics of the original data, and the oversampled data by the SMOTE provides high reliability. The results show that the RF is suitable for performing classification with high accuracy in the range of 1.2–2.4 of safety factors. This study demonstrates that it is possible to classify even discontinuous data through a preprocessing technique, and SMOTE can improve the accuracy of landslide risk mapping. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment,10.1007/s10064-023-03403-0,1,1,No,,,South Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yanshan County was selected as the case study. The multicollinearity diagnoses Spearman’s and ReliefF were applied to judge the proper factors for modeling landslide susceptibility, and the results demonstrate that plan curvature and topographic wetness index are not proper factors in Yanshan County; hence, these factors were not used. Based on several statistical indices, the three integrated models achieve better results than the MLP model. MultiboostAB-MLP is a more stable and effective model, and the three integrated models were better than the existing machine learning algorithm.

Modeling and predicting the possibility of landslides are important in order to monitor and prevent their negative consequences. In this study, landslides are the primary research object. Further, the frequency ratio (FR) method was applied to the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT) regression algorithms for landslide sensitivity assessment. It was also applied to landslide risk assessment mapping in the Longmen Mountain area. Therefore, taking into account the positive and negative sample balance, 7774 historical landslide points and 7774 non-landslide points were selected and divided them into training sets and test sets. The influence factors were selected and analyzed through multicollinearity analysis and the FR method. To improve the performance of the model and the accuracy of the findings, the individual environmental factors are normalized. Subsequently, the LSI (landslide susceptibility index), was obtained by calculating the frequency ratio. Following this, the RF, SVM, and DT were used to construct the model. The trained model calculates the landslide probability of each cell in the study area and generates the resultant susceptibility map. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and R 2 of this region were calculated to evaluate the model’s performance. The results indicate that RF obtained the highest predictive performance (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82) in landslide risk prediction, followed by SVM (AUC = 0.8) and DT (AUC = 0.69). The results of this study serve as a predictive map for landslide susceptibility areas and provide critical support for the security of lives and property for the human and socio-economic development in the Longmen Mountain region. In addition, the experiment results reveal that the machine learning model based on the FR method can improve the accuracy and performance of methods in studies related to landslide susceptibility.

We extract geospatial features such as slope, aspect, and rainfall over Guangxi, China, and apply an extreme gradient boosting model pre-trained on contiguous United States datasets. The model produces susceptibility maps that indicate landslide probability at different scales. However, the lack of accurate data on historical landslides in Guangxi challenges the model evaluation and comparison between regions. To overcome this, we calibrate the model to fit the local conditions in Guangxi. The calibrated model agrees with the observed landslide locations, implying its capability to capture regional variations in landslide mechanisms. We apply the model at a 30 m resolution along the Heba Expressway and validate it against reports from July 2021 to March 2022. The model correctly predicts five of seven landslide events in this period with a reasonable alarm rate. This framework has the potential for large-scale landslide risk management by informing transportation planning and infrastructure maintenance decisions.

With the development of remote sensing technology, many scholars have applied it to landslide susceptibility assessment to improve model accuracy; however, how to couple these two to obtain the optimal susceptibility assessment model remains to be studied. Based on Sentinel-1 data, relevant data, and existing research results, the information value method (IV), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) models were selected to analyze landslide susceptibility in the urban area of Wanzhou. Models with superior performance will be coupled with PS-InSAR deformation data using two methods: joint training and weighted overlay. The accuracy of different models was assessed and compared with the aim of determining the optimal coupling model and the role of InSAR in the model. The results indicate that the accuracy of different landslide susceptibility prediction models is ranked as RF > SVM > CNN > IV. Among the coupled dynamic models, the performance ranking was as follows: InSAR jointly trained RF (IJRF) > InSAR weighted overlay RF (IWRF) > InSAR jointly trained SVM (IJSVM) > InSAR weighted overlay SVM (IWSVM). Notably, the IJRF model, which combines InSAR deformation data through joint training, exhibited the highest accuracy, with an AUC value of 0.995. In the factor importance analysis within the IJRF model, InSAR deformation data ranked third after hydrological distance (0.210) and elevation (0.163), with a value of 0.154. A comparison between landslide dynamic susceptibility mapping (LDSM) and landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) revealed that the inclusion of InSAR deformation data effectively reduced false positives around the landslide areas. The results suggest that joint training is the most suitable coupling method, allowing for the optimal expression of InSAR deformation data and enhancing the predictive accuracy of the model.

As a significant area for disaster prevention and control, it is crucial to assess the susceptibility of landslides for effective geological disaster prevention, urban planning, and development. This research focuses on eleven influencing factors, including elevation, slope, slope direction, rainfall, NDVI, and distance from faults, selected as evaluation indexes. The assessment model is constructed using the information quantity method and the information quantity logistic regression coupling method to analyze the landslide susceptibility in Shuangbai County. The entire region’s landslide susceptibility is classified into four categories: not likely to occur, low susceptibility, medium susceptibility, and high susceptibility. The accuracy and reasonableness of the models are tested and compared. The results indicate that the coupled information–logistic regression model (80.0% accuracy) outperforms the single information model (74.2% accuracy). Moreover, the density of disaster points in the high-susceptibility area of the coupled model is higher, making it more reasonable.

This study investigates the influence of different absence sampling methods, including buffer control sampling (BCS), controlled target space exteriorization sampling (CTSES), information value (IV), and mini-batch k-medoids (MBKM), on landslide susceptibility mapping in Songyang County, China, using support vector machines and random forest algorithms. Various evaluation metrics are employed to compare the efficacy of these sampling methods for susceptibility zoning. The results demonstrate that CTSES, IV, and MBKM methods exhibit an expansion of the high susceptibility region (maximum susceptibility mean value reaching 0.87) and divergence in the susceptibility index when extreme absence samples are present, with MBKM showing a comparative advantage (lower susceptibility mean value) compared to the IV model. Building on the strengths of different sampling methods, a novel integrative sampling approach that incorporates multiple existing methods is proposed. The integrative sampling can mitigate negative effects caused by extreme absence samples (susceptibility mean value is approximately 0.5 in the same extreme samples and presence-absence ratio) and obtain significantly better prediction results (AUC = 0.92, KC = 0.73, POA = 2.46 in the best model).

MLAs provide insights for reliable prediction and understanding of the processes and risk of hazards at various scales. This paper integrated multiple MLAs, including hierarchical clusters (HCs) and multilayer perceptron networks (MPN1, MPN2 and MPN3), in investigating soil erosion and landslide susceptibility in Southeast Nigeria. The developed HCs efficiently ranked the susceptibility and risks of the studied gullies. MPN1 predicted the cohesion and ϕ of the gully soils, with its area under curve ranging from 0.857 to 1.000 for cohesion and R2 for ϕ at 0.643. MPN2 predicted the factor of safety (FS) for dry and wet climatic conditions (based on geotechnical variables), having R2 in the range of 0.880–0.902. MPN3 predicted the FS for both conditions (based on estimated geometrical variables and porewater pressures) and expressed R2 ranging from 0.655 to 0.685. The findings of this study bear positive significances for erosion and landslide risk analysts and managers. Moreover, the MPN models support the motion that high accuracy thresholds would be realized when the findings are utilized for risk planning and management. The use of these MLAs has proven to be economical and much more usable and manageable than tedious and expensive conventional experimental works.

In this study, we develop a feature enhancement framework that integrates attention and multiscale mechanisms with U-Net (AMU-Net) for landslide detection. The framework has four steps. First, the attention module in the convolutional block enhances the feature response of landslides when extracting high-level feature representations. Second, the multiscale module in skip connection captures more contextual information when concatenating fine and coarse features. Third, the U-Net architecture encodes feature mapping and decodes semantics representations. Fourth, the shifted window was applied to enhance the receptive field of pixels in the prediction process, which reduced the errors of landslide boundaries. Besides, we explored the effect of random split and regional split methods on model training. In the upper reach of the Jinsha River, data on unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) images and digital surface model (DSM) were prepared for landslide detection. The design of the framework and experiments considers the disparities in data between UAV and satellite remote sensing. The controlled experiments reported that the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for the proposed AMU-Net achieved 0.797, which was over 2% higher than other models. Furthermore, the visualized feature maps revealed that the proposed method can effectively restrain irrelevant feature responses in backgrounds and capture features from various receptive fields.

An inventory and detailed analysis of 2506 landslides has been carried out, in which five basic typologies have been differentiated: avalanches, debris flows, slides, earth flows and creeping areas. Debris avalanches and debris flows occur mainly in metamorphic materials (phyllites, schists and quartz-sandstones), areas with sparse vegetation, steep slopes and lower sections of hillslopes; meanwhile, slides, earth flows and creep occur in Cretaceous lutites, crop/grass lands, medium and low slopes and lower-middle sections of the hillslopes. Based on this analysis, landslide susceptibility models have been made for the different typologies and with different methods (matrix, discriminant analysis, random forest and neural networks) and input factors.

Considering demands for the future large-scale landslide mapping, this study aims to develop a new deep learning–based method to detect landslides using medium-resolution imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) data which are free-access and covered globally. Firstly, a workflow for constructing the landslide dataset is developed. Then, we design a semantic segmentation model to learn deep features and generate per-pixel landslide predictions. Specifically, the proposed network has a dual-encoder architecture with feature fusion to hierarchically represent deep features from the optical bands and DEM data. We also employ a self-attention module in the decoder of the proposed network to improve the performance. Experiments on two regions demonstrate that our method achieves the best F1 score of 79.24%, outperforming SegNet, U-Net, and Attention U-Net, the models popularly used in the semantic segmentation–based landslide detection.

Firstly, a dataset consisting of 1531 historical landslides was collected from field investigations and historical records, and a spatial database containing 16 predisposing factors was established. The dataset was divided into a training set and a test set in a ratio of 7:3. The results showed that SWA effectively improved the Accuracy, AUC, and robustness of the model compared to a single ML model. The SWA achieved the best classification results (Accuracy = 91.39% and AUC = 0.967). To verify the generalization ability of SWA, we selected published landslide datasets from Yanshan country and Yongxin country in China for testing. SWA also performed well, with an AUC of 0.871 and 0.860, respectively.

However, the obvious surface rupture zones usually do not occur in some buried-fault earthquake cases, which means information about the distance to the surface rupture is lacking. In this study, a new influencing factor named coseismic ground deformation was added to remedy this shortcoming. The Mid-Niigata prefecture earthquake was regarded as the study case. To select a more suitable model for generating the landslide susceptibility map, three commonly used models named logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) were also conducted to assess landslide susceptibility. The performances of these three models were evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic curve. The calculated results showed that the ANN model has the highest area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.82.

For this, the main aim of the current research is to synthesize the three natural resources (groundwater, wetland, and forest) into one multi-resource (MR) potentiality map and three natural hazards (flood, landslide, and shoreline erosion) into one multi-hazard (MH) susceptibility map. To achieve this goal, several inventories, geo-environmental factors, satellite bands, and indices have been taken as input data sets. Random forest (RF) model has been considered for individual mapping (except shoreline erosion mapping) due to its high precision. For shoreline erosion mapping, digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) model has been employed. The accuracies of the model have been determined from the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, producer accuracy (PA), and user accuracy (UA). RF model has more than 90% prediction accuracy in different resource and hazard mapping, whereas for the forest mapping, PA and UA are 90% and 80%, respectively. The results of this study for multi-resource mapping show forest (24.05%) and groundwater (22.28%) as the major resources, whereas flood (17.27%) is the most destructive in comparison with other hazards. The multi-resource and multi-hazard maps of the research area provide an important tool to land managers and policymakers for sustainable development and management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Earth Sciences,10.1007/s12665-023-10901-7,1,1,Yes,RF,,"India,Democratic Republic Congo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Landslide susceptibility evaluation (LSE) can predict where landslides may occur and has caught the attention of scientists all over the world. This work establishes integrated criteria of potential landslide recognition and combines the historical landslides and newly-identified potential landslides to improve the accuracy, rationality, and practicability of a LSE map. Moreover, slope units can well reflect the topographic constraint to landslide occurrence and development, and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can well portray the topological and feature relation among various slope units. The combination of slope units and GCN is for the first time employed in LSE. This work focuses on Wanzhou District, a famous landslide-serious region in the Three Gorges reservoir area, and employs multisource data to conduct potential landslide recognition and LSE and to reveal the distribution characteristics of high landslide susceptibility. Some new viewpoints are suggested as follows. 1) The established criteria of potential landslide recognition consist of the characteristics of active deformation, stratum and lithology, tectonics, topography, micro-geomorphology, environment, meteorology, earthquakes, and human engineering activity. These criteria can well eliminate 4 types of false alarm regions and is successfully validated by field survey. 2) 34 potential landslides are newly discovered, and the movement of these potential landslides were controlled or induced by the combined action of soft-hard interbedding rock mass, steep topography, frequent tectonic movement, strong fluvial erosion, abundant precipitation, and intensive road and building construction. 3) The GCN algorithm reaches a relatively high accuracy (AUC: 0.941) and outperforms the other representative machine learning algorithms of Convolutional Neural Network (AUC: 0.926), Support Vector Machine (AUC: 0.835), and CART Tree (AUC: 0.762). 4) High landslide susceptibility is caused by the coupled action of weathered rock cavities, soft rock and swelling soil, strong river erosion, abundant rainfall, and intensive human engineering activity.

Landslides lead to severe economic damage and property loss, as well as fatalities. Furthermore, they tend to increase in the context of climate change. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively assess landslide susceptibility across the Hengduan Mountain Region in southwest China. Specifically, the analysis is focused on the eastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau within the context of future climate change scenarios, which are based on the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) global climate model ensemble. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) were selected in order to map landslide susceptibility within the context of 1.5–4.0 °C warming scenarios. This was achieved by considering the changes in extreme rainfall that exceeded the landslide triggering thresholds. The results show that the frequency over extreme rainfall thresholds (FOERT) tend to increase in conjunction with warming targets, thereby ranging from 2.3/a (at a 1.5 °C warming) to 9.0/a (at a 4.0 °C warming) on average. Such elevated extreme precipitation events contribute to an increase in projected future zones of high landslide susceptibility when compared to the historical baseline period ranging from −1.2% (at a 1.5 °C warming) to 4.0% (at a 4.0 °C warming) using different machine learning models. Moreover, the extent of high susceptibility zones increases more significantly in the context of 4.0 °C warming when compared to the historical baseline results. These results indicate the importance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 as well as 2 °C. The high landslide susceptibility zones estimated by the CMIP6 multi-models ensemble are mainly located in the central and southeastern regions of the Hengduan Mountain Region. The possible changes in terms of introducing extreme precipitation in order to assess landslide susceptibility in the context of climate change that is proposed in this study may be further applied to additional study areas. These projections under different targets can provide scientific guidelines for the purposes of the development of climate change adaptation strategies. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14020214,1,1,Yes,"GAM,RF,LGBM",,"China,South Korea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is important to understand or predict the probability of landslide occurrence at potentially risky sites. A commonly used means is to carry out a landslide susceptibility assessment based on a landslide inventory and a set of landslide contributing factors. This can be readily achieved using machine learning (ML) models such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), or deep learning (DL) models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short time memory (LSTM). As the input data for these models, landslide contributing factors have varying influences on landslide occurrence. Therefore, it is logically feasible to select more important contributing factors and eliminate less relevant ones, with the aim of increasing the prediction accuracy of these models. However, selecting more important factors is still a challenging task and there is no generally accepted method. Furthermore, the effects of factor selection using various methods on the prediction accuracy of ML and DL models are unclear. In this study, the impact of the selection of contributing factors on the accuracy of landslide susceptibility predictions using ML and DL models was investigated. Four methods for selecting contributing factors were considered for all the aforementioned ML and DL models, which included Information Gain Ratio (IGR), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operators (LASSO) and Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO). In addition, autoencoder-based factor selection methods for DL models were also investigated. To assess their performances, an exhaustive approach was adopted, testing all possible selection cases of contributing factors, the results of which served as the benchmark. The results confirmed that using more important contributing factors improved the prediction accuracy of the ML models considered. However, it was interesting to find that the selection of contributing factors using IGR and RFE reduced the predictive accuracy of the DL models. For the DL models, using an autoencoder architecture improved their prediction performance. The study also found that the choice of factor selection methods was far more effective than the selection of contributing factors in improving the prediction accuracy of landslide susceptibility. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,10.1007/s00477-023-02556-4,1,1,Yes,"LOGR,SVM,RF,XGB,CNN,LSTM",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence and recurrence of landslides are conditioned by several aspects related to soil properties, geological structure, climatic conditions, soil cover, and water flow. Precisely, Colombia is one of the most affected by this type of natural hazard, as well as by floods, since they are the natural phenomena that bring with them the most severe risks for communities. In this work, we articulated the statistical approach of the landslide conditioning factors, Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA), and Geographic Information System (GIS), evaluating a flexible and agile methodology to estimate the landslide susceptibility defining areas prone to the landslide occurrence. The MLA were validated in a case study in the “La Liboriana” River basin, located in the Municipality of Salgar in the Colombian mountains Andes where Landslide Susceptibility Maps (LSMs) were obtained. The obtained MLA results hold immense potential in the field of regional landslide mapping, facilitating the development of effective strategies aimed at minimizing the devastating impacts on human lives, infrastructure, and the natural environment. By leveraging these findings, proactive measures can be devised to safeguard vulnerable areas, mitigate risks, and ensure the safety and well-being of communities. Seven supervised MLA were employed, two regression algorithms (Logistic) and five decision tree algorithms (Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees [RPART], Conditional Inference Trees [CTREE], Random Forest [RF], Ranger, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm [XGBoost]). The LSMs were produced for each MLA. Considering different performance metrics, the RF model yields the best classification accuracy with an area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 95% and 90% of accuracy, providing the most representative results.

Second, the landslide points were randomly divided into two groups (70%/30%) for training and validation. Then, 16 landslide conditioning factors were selected, namely slope aspect, slope angle, elevation, topographic roughness index (TRI), slope length (SL), convergence index (CI), terrain positioning index (TPI), profile curvature, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, lithology, soil, rainfall, land use, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Variance inflation factors (VIF), tolerance (TOL), and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) were used to detect potential multicollinearity problems between these factors.

Firstly, we identified 169 landslides through field surveys and image interpretation. Then, a landslide inventory map was built. These 169 historical landslides were randomly classified into two groups: 70% for training data and 30% for validation data. Then, 15 landslide conditioning factors were considered for mapping landslide susceptibility. The three ensemble outputs were estimated with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and statistical tests, as well as a new approach, the improved frequency ratio accuracy. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) for the training data (success rate) of the three algorithms were 0.722 for BFT, 0.869 for BagBFT, and 0.895 for RFBFT. The AUCs for the validating groups (prediction rates) were 0.718, 0.834, and 0.872, respectively.

Site-specific landslide inventories are often more accurate and complete than national or worldwide databases. For these reasons, detailed landslide inventory and predisposing variables must be collected to derive reliable LS products. However, high-quality data are often rare, and risk managers must consider lower-resolution available products with no more than informative purposes. In this work, we compared different ML models to select the most accurate for large-scale LS assessment within the Municipality of Rome. The ExtraTreesClassifier outperformed the others reaching an average F1-score of 0.896.

The main objective of this study was to propose an application of artificial intelligence systems, then evaluate and compare their efficiency for developing accurate landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). The present study aims to explore and compare the frequency ratio (FR) method with three machine learning (ML) techniques, namely, random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and multiple layer neural networks (MLP), for landslide susceptibility assessment in East Azerbaijan, Iran. To achieve this goal, 20 landslide-occurrence-related influencing factors were considered. A sum of 766 locations with landslide inventory was recognized in the context of the study, and the relief-F method was utilized in order to measure the conditioning factors’ prediction capacity in landslide models. In the forthcoming phase, three ML models (SVM, RF, and MLP) were trained by the training dataset. Lastly, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and statistical procedures were employed to validate and contrast the predictive capability of the FR model with the obtained three models. The findings of the study in terms of the relief-F method for the importance ranking of conditioning factors in the context area uncovered those eleven factors, such as slope, aspect, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and elevation, have the highest impact on the occurrence of the landslide. The results show that the MLP model had the utmost rate of landslide spatial prediction capability (87.06%), after which the SVM model (80.0%), the RF model (76.67%), and the FR model (61.25%) demonstrated the second, third, and fourth rates.

In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted on LSM using machine learning techniques. However, the majority of machine learning models is considered “black box” models due to their lack of transparent explanations. In contrast, the QLattice model serves as a white box model, as it can elucidate the decision-making mechanism while representing a novel approach to whitening machine learning models. QLattice possesses the capability to automatically select and scale data features. In this study, Fengjie County in China was selected as the research area, with slope units serving as evaluation units. A geospatial database was constructed using 12 conditioning factors, including elevation, slope, and annual average rainfall. LSM models were conducted using both the QLattice and random forest (RF) algorithms. The findings demonstrate that the QLattice model achieved an area under curve value of 0.868, while the RF model attained an area under curve value of 0.849 for the test datasets. These results highlight the superior predictive ability and stability of the QLattice model compared with RF. Furthermore, QLattice can explicate and clarify the change processes of conditioning factors, thereby revealing the internal decision-making mechanism and causes behind the LSM model's decisions.

In order to increase confidence in pluvial flood susceptibility mapping, overland flow models need to be intensively evaluated using observations from past events. However, most remote-sensing-based flood detection techniques only focus on the identification of degradations and/or water pixels in the close vicinity of overflowing streams after heavy rainfall. Many occurrences of pluvial-flood-induced damages such as soil erosion, gullies, landslides and mudflows located further away from the stream are thus often unrevealed. To fill this gap, a transferable remote sensing fusion method called FuSVIPR, for Fusion of Sentinel-2 & Very high resolution Imagery for Pluvial Runoff, is developed to produce damage-detection maps. Based on very high spatial resolution optical imagery (from Pléiades satellites or airborne sensors) combined with 10 m change images from Sentinel-2 satellites, the Random Forest and U-net machine/deep learning techniques are separately trained and compared to locate pluvial flood footprints on the ground at 0.5 m spatial resolution following heavy weather events. In this work, three flash flood events in the Aude and Alpes-Maritimes departments in the South of France are investigated, covering over more than 160 km2 of rural and periurban areas between 2018 and 2020. Pluvial-flood-detection accuracies hover around 75% (with a minimum area detection ratio for annotated ground truths of 25%), and false-positive rates mostly below 2% are achieved on all three distinct events using a cross-site validation framework. FuSVIPR is then further evaluated on the latest devastating flash floods of April 2022 in the Durban area (South Africa), without additional training. Very good agreement with the impact maps produced in the context of the International Charter “Space and Major Disasters” are reached with similar performance figures. These results emphasize the high generalization capability of this method to locate pluvial floods at any time of the year and over diverse regions worldwide using a very high spatial resolution visible product and two Sentinel-2 images. The resulting impact maps have high potential for helping thorough evaluation and improvement of surface water inundation models and boosting extreme precipitation downscaling at a very high spatial resolution. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15092361,1,1,No,,,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five continuous landslide impact factor interval attribute classifications (4, 8, 12, 16, 20) and three data-driven models (deep belief networks (DBN), random forest (RF), and neural network (back propagation (BP)) were used for a total of fifteen different scenarios of landslide susceptibility prediction studies in order to investigate the effects of these two factors on modeling and perform a landslide susceptibility index uncertainty analysis (including precision evaluation and statistical law). The findings indicate that: (1) The results demonstrate that for the same model, as the interval attribute value rises from 4 to 8 and finally to 20, the forecast accuracy of landslide susceptibility initially increases gradually, then progressively grows until stable. (2) The DBN model, followed by the RF and BP models, provides the highest prediction accuracy for the same interval attribute value. (3) AIN = 20 and DBN models have the highest prediction accuracy under 15 combined conditions, while AIN = 4 and BP models have the lowest. The accuracy and efficiency of landslide susceptibility modeling are higher when the AIN = 8 and DBN models are combined. (4) The landslide susceptibility index uncertainty predicted by the deeper learning model and the bigger interval attribute value is comparatively low, which is more in line with the real landslide probability distribution features.

Efficient Landslide Early Warning Systems (LEWS) are the best way to reduce the risk due to such events, but the number of operational LEWS is still limited. A new data-driven approach for spatio-temporal landslide forecasting on a regional scale is proposed, integrating Landslide Susceptibility Maps (LSMs) using RF algorithm and probabilistic hydro-meteorological thresholds, considering both rainfall severity and antecedent soil wetness. The proposed method is also compared with two deterministic process-based approaches: Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-based Regional Slope Stability (TRIGRS) and SHALSTAB, considering the spatial variability in soil thickness and properties, along with the rainfall data. The quantitative comparison is carried out for two test areas in the Western Ghats of India (Idukki and Wayanad), for two different spatial resolutions. The efficiency and area under the curve (AUC) values from a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were used to evaluate the performance of different models. The results for Idukki indicate that the efficiency values of the data-driven approach were improved by 4.67 % by using fine resolution DEM (digital elevation model) of 12.5 m resolution, while in the case of TRIGRS and SHALSTAB models, the improvements were 3.39 % and 1.83 %, respectively. For Wayanad, the improvement in efficiencies was further lesser, 2.59 % in the case of data-driven model, and 0.95 % and 0.73 % in the cases of TRIGRS and SHALSTAB, respectively. The maximum efficiency and AUC values were obtained by the data-driven model for both regions, with a spatial resolution of 12.5 m. The maximum efficiency values were obtained as 81.21 % and 83.33 % for Idukki and Wayanad, respectively, and the corresponding AUC values were 0.92 and 0.93.

In this study, a deep learning-based segmentation model called CAM-K-SEG was proposed, which combined Grad-CAM visualization and K-Mean clustering methods to automatically detect landslide areas using satellite images. The methodology involved applying the CAM-K-SEG model to satellite images in the Bijou region of China and comparing its performance with that of K-Mean clustering and U-Net segmentation models. The optimum K value was determined by the elbow method to determine the effective color number. The weighted object was detected by removing small objects from the image, and the convolution process was performed with the mean Kernel method to remove noise or improve features. The performance of the CAM-K-SEG model was evaluated based on Intersection-Over-Union (IoU), the most used metric in semantic segmentation. The results demonstrated that the CAM-K-SEG model performed comparably to the U-Net model in segmenting landslide areas and could help improve the rapid detection of landslide areas after an event. Overall, the study contributed to the development of a new model for landslide image segmentation, which could more precisely and sensitively distinguish landslide regions.

More and more scholars pay attention to the problem of the prevention of landslide disasters. Therefore, the landslide susceptibility prediction is generated, which can play an important role in the design of land development and urban development schemes in mountainous areas. In this paper, the frequency ratio (FR) model is used to quantitatively analyze the relationship between each factor and the occurrence of landslide (elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to faults, rainfall, distance to rivers, soil types, land cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and distance to roads). Based on the analysis of landslide distribution, 12 influencing factors were selected to establish the landslide susceptibility evaluation index system. Historical landslide points were randomly divided into training (70% of the total) and validation (30%) sets. Thereafter, decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF) models were used to generate the landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and the predictive performance of the three models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The FR model results showed that landslides mostly occurred at slopes of 0–15°, elevations of <1000 m, distance to rivers of 0–500 m, rainfall of 750–840 mm, NDVI of 0.8–0.9, distance to roads of 0–500 m, distance to faults of 1500–2000 m and transportation land.

Layer-1 uses topographical, hydrogeological, and meteorological features collected from various sources. The binary classifier in this layer classifies and predicts the probability of landslide occurrence. Layer-2 classifies landslides into debris flow, rockfall, and surficial slides and predicts debris flow through a multi-class classifier. To achieve better prediction accuracy, the landslide features that significantly influence the landslide occurrence of layer-1 are combined with layer-2. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is used to balance the database of minority categories. Classification and prediction are achieved using machine learning models such as the support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient-boosting, and their performances are compared. The feature score for every feature of the model is calculated using the feature importance technique. The machine learning models are validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve and F1-score. On comparison, Extreme Gradient-Boost is found to perform well. Based on the prediction probability, the debris flow is classified into high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk regions. This favored in identifying vulnerable areas and appropriate mitigation measures to reduce life loss and damage to infrastructure. © 2023 IETE.",IETE Journal of Research,10.1080/03772063.2023.2217802,1,1,No,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, eight causative factors were selected for a library of factors, and then a landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) was performed based on the machine learning techniques of Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, respectively. The prediction abilities of the above two LSM models were assessed using the area under curve (AUC) value of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, precision, recall ratio, accuracy, and specificity.

There were still some differences between the models’ performances shown by the results: RF (AUC = 0.966) outperformed ANN (AUC = 0.914). The RF model demonstrated a higher degree of correlation between the areas classified as very low and high susceptibility in comparison to the ANN model. The results provided a theoretical framework upon which machine learning applications could be applied (e.g., RF and ANN), a reliable and low-cost tool to assess landslide susceptibility.

A complete landslide inventory, which is essential but difficult to obtain, should include high-quality landslide and non-landslide samples. The insufficient number of landslide samples and the low purity of non-landslide samples limit the performance of the machine learning models. In response, this study aims to explore the effectiveness of isolated forest (IF) to solve the problem of insufficient landslide samples. IF belongs to unsupervised learning, and only a small share of landslide samples in the study area were required for modeling, while the remaining samples were used for testing. Its performance was compared to another advanced integration model, adaptive boosting integrated with decision tree (Ada-DT), which belongs to two-class classifiers (TCC) and needs a sufficient number of samples. Huangpu District, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province in China, was selected as the study area, and 13 predisposing factors were prepared for the modeling. Results showed that the IF proved its effectiveness with an AUC value of 0.875, although the Ada-DT model performed better (AUC = 0.921). IF outperformed the Ada-DT model in terms of recognizing landslides, and the sensitivity values of IF and the Ada-DT model were 90.00% and 86.67%, respectively, while the Ada-DT model performed better in terms of specificity. Two susceptibility maps obtained by the models were basically consistent with the field investigation, while the areas predicted by IF tended to be conservative as higher risk areas were presented, and the Ada-DT model was likely to be risky. It is suggested to select non-landslide samples from the very low susceptibility areas predicted by the IF model to form a more reliable sample set for Ada-DT modeling. The conclusion confirms the practicality and advancement of the idea of anomaly detection in LSP and improves the application potential of machine learning algorithms for geohazards. © 2022 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su142416692,2,1,Yes,"IF,AB",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to the enormous threat to human life and property caused by the increasing number of mass movements, it is imperative to develop a reliable nationwide mass movement susceptibility model to identify mass movement-prone regions and formulate appropriate disaster prevention strategies. In recent years, the mixed-effects models have shown their unique advantages in dealing with the biased mass movement inventory, yet there are no relevant studies to compare different mixed-effects models. This research compared three mixed-effects models to explore the most plausible and robust susceptibility mapping model, considering the inherently heterogeneously complete mass movement information. Based on a preliminary data analysis, eight critical factors influencing mass movements were selected as basis predictors: the slope, aspect, profile curvature, plan curvature, road density, river density, soil moisture, and lithology. Two additional factors, namely, the land use and geological environment division, representing the inventory bias were selected as random intercepts. Subsequently, three mixed-effects models—Statistical-based generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM), generalized additive mixed-effects model (GAMM), and machine learning-based tree-boosted mixed-effects model (TBMM)—were adopted. These models were used to evaluate the susceptibility of three distinct types of mass movements (i.e., 28,814 debris flows, 54,586 rockfalls and 108,432 landslides), respectively. The results were compared both from quantitative and qualitative perspectives. The results showed that TBMM performed best in all three cases with AUROCs (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) of cross-validation, spatial cross-validation, and predictions on simulated highly biased inventory, all exceeding 0.8. In addition, the spatial prediction patterns of TBMM were more in line with the natural geomorphological underlying process, indicating that TBMM can better reduce the impact of inventory bias than GLMM and GAMM. Finally, factor contribution analysis showed the key role of topographic factors in predicting the occurrence of mass movements, followed by road density and soil moisture. This study contributes to assessing China’s overall mass movement susceptibility situation and assisting policymakers in master planning for risk mitigation. Further, it demonstrates the tremendous potential of TBMM for mass movement susceptibility assessment, despite inherent biases in the inventory. © 2022 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs14236068,1,1,Yes,GBM,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These types of floods are mostly associated with landslides and erosion of roads within a short time.Most of Vietnamis hilly and mountainous; thus, the problem due to flash flood is severe and requires systematic studies to correctly identify flood susceptible areas for proper landuse planning and traffic management. In this study, three Machine Learning (ML) methods namely Deep Learning Neural Network (DL), Correlation-based Feature Weighted Naive Bayes (CFWNB), and Adaboost (AB-CFWNB) were used for the development of flash flood susceptibility maps for hilly road section (115 km length) of National Highway (NH)-6 inHoa Binh province, Vietnam. In the proposedmodels, 88 past flash flood events were used together with 14 flash floods affecting topographical and geo-environmental factors. The performance of themodels was evaluated using standard statisticalmeasures including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, Area Under Curve (AUC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results revealed that all the models performed well (AUC > 0.80) in predicting flash flood susceptibility zones, but the performance of the DL model is the best (AUC: 0.972, RMSE: 0.352). Therefore, the DL model can be applied to develop an accurate flash flood susceptibility map of hilly terrain which can be used for proper planning and designing of the highways and other infrastructure facilities besides landuse management of the area. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Nowadays, deep learning methods exhibit excellent performance in supervised landslide detection. However, due to differences between cross-scene images, the performance of existing methods is significantly degraded when directly applied to another scene, which limits the application of rapid landslide inventory mapping. In this study, we propose a novel Domain Style and Feature Adaptation (DSFA) method for cross-scene landslide detection from high spatial resolution images, which can leverage labeled source domain images and unlabeled target domain images to mine robust landslide representations for different scenes. Specifically, we mitigate the large discrepancy between domains at the dataset level and feature level. At the dataset level, we introduce a domain style adaptation strategy to shift landslide styles, which not only bridges the domain gap, but also increases the diversity of landslide samples. At the feature level, adversarial learning and domain distance minimization are integrated to narrow large feature distribution discrepancies for learning domain-invariant information. In addition, to avoid information omission, we improve the U-Net3+ model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DSFA has superior detection capability and outperforms other methods, showing its great application potential in unsupervised landslide domain detection. © 2023 The Author(s).

Heterogeneous and homogeneous ensemble types can be distinguished; four ensembles of each approach were implemented in the Djebahia region. The heterogeneous ensembles include stacking (ST), voting (VO), weighting (WE), and a new approach in landslide assessment called meta-dynamic ensemble selection (DES), while the homogeneous ensembles include AdaBoost (ADA), bagging (BG), random forest (RF), and random subspace (RSS). To ensure a consistent comparison, each ensemble was implemented using individual base learners. The heterogeneous ensembles were generated by combining eight different machine learning algorithms, while the homogeneous ensembles only used a single base learner, with diversity achieved through resampling the training dataset. The spatial dataset used in this study consisted of 115 landslide events and 12 conditioning factors, which were randomly divided into training and testing datasets. The models were evaluated through various aspects, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, root mean squared error (RMSE), landslide density distribution (LDD), threshold-dependent metrics (Kappa index, accuracy, and recall scores), and a global visual representation using the Taylor diagram. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis (SA) was conducted for the best performing models to assess the importance of the factors and the resilience of the ensembles. The results revealed that homogeneous ensembles outperformed heterogeneous ensembles in terms of AUC and threshold-dependent metrics, with AUC ranging from 0.962 to 0.971 for the test dataset. ADA was the best performing model for these metrics and the least in terms of RMSE (0.366). However, the heterogeneous ensemble ST provided a finer RMSE (0.272), and DES showed the best LDD, indicating a stronger potential to generalize the phenomenon. The Taylor diagram was consistent with the other results, indicating that ST was the best performing model, followed by RSS. The SA demonstrated that RSS was the most robust (mean AUC variation of − 0.022) and ADA was the least robust (mean AUC variation of − 0.038). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1007/s11356-023-26247-3,1,1,Yes,"AB,BDT,RF,RSS",,Algeria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we overcome the shortcomings of CNN and ViT by fusing these two deep learning models (bottleneck transformer network (BoTNet) and convolutional vision transformer network (ConViT)), and the fused model was used to predict the probability of landslide occurrence. First, we integrated historical landslide data and landslide evaluation factors and analysed whether there was covariance in the landslide evaluation factors. Then, the testing accuracy and generalisation ability of the CNN, ViT, BoTNet and ConViT models were compared and analysed. Finally, four landslide susceptibility mapping models were used to predict the probability of landslide occurrence in Pingwu County, Sichuan Province, China. Among them, BoTNet and ConViT had the highest accuracy, both at 87.78%, an improvement of 1.11% compared to a single model, while ConViT had the highest F1-socre at 87.64%, an improvement of 1.28% compared to a single model. The results indicate that the fusion model of CNN and ViT has better LSM performance than the single model.

To mitigate these hazards, scientists employ landslide susceptibility mapping that evaluates zones prone to landslides and identifies contributing factors. This study aimed to introduce ensemble landslide susceptibility models based on a statistical model (analytical hierarchy process) and a machine learning model (support vector machine) for predicting landslides in a part of the Darjeeling district, West Bengal, India. A total of 114 landslide locations were identified and randomly divided into training and validation databases, with proportions of 70% and 30%, respectively. Ten conditioning factors were considered, including rainfall, soil texture, slope, aspect, geomorphology, lithology, curvature, land use and land cover, drainage density, and lineament density. The AHP-SVM model, employing linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid function algorithms, was applied using the training landslide and non-landslide datasets along with the spatial database of conditioning factors. Four landslide susceptibility maps were generated using this model, and their accuracy was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) tool with the validation dataset. Among the four ensemble methods tested (AHP-SVM_Sigmoid, AHP-SVM_RBF, AHP-SVM_Polynomial, and AHP-SVM_Linear), the AHP-SVM_Sigmoid model demonstrated the highest degree-of-fit and prediction performance, achieving a prediction capability of 86.2%. Consequently, it is concluded that the AHP-SVM_Sigmoid ensemble model holds promise as a novel technique for spatial landslide prediction in future studies. The findings of this study are valuable for local planning and decision-makers and can be utilized to implement landslide susceptibility methods in other regions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,10.1007/s00477-023-02528-8,1,1,Yes,SVM,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In case of high-intensity events, landslide mitigation is not always possible so that the best way to prevent disasters is to reduce the exposed value in susceptible areas. Landslide risk assessment is a fundamental tool for reducing loss induced by landslides, especially considering the impact of high-intensity landslides on the socioeconomic development of developing countries. Risk mitigation requires, at least, to be based on a susceptibility scenario and on inventory of existing settlements. On this basis, a study concerning landslide impacting settlements in the city of Cuenca (Ecuador) has been carried out using a landslide inventory database (LID) and supply energy contract database representing a proxy of buildings presence. The susceptibility analysis indicates that most of the slope surrounding the city of Cuenca, where the greatest urban expansion has taken place, is highly prone to instability. In addition, multi-temporal supply energy contract analysis highlights that expansion of urban areas is occurring at a steady rate and such extension is corresponding to an increase in areas susceptible to landslide.

In order to reduce the probability of these slope instabilities, methods like tension crack mapping, inclinometer measurements, time domain reflectometry, borehole extensometers, piezometer, radar systems and image processing systems are deployed. These systems work efficiently for single site slope failures, but as the number of mining sites increase, dependency of one site slope failure on nearby sites also increases. Current systems are not able to capture this data, due to which the probability of accidents at open cast mines increases. In order to reduce this probability, a high efficiency internet of things (IoT) based continuous slope monitoring and control system is designed. This system assists in improving the efficiency of real-time slope monitoring via usage of a sensor array consisting of radar, reflectometer, inclinometer, piezometer and borehole extensometer. All these measurements are given to a high efficiency machine learning classifier which uses data mining, and based on its output suitable actions are taken to reduce accidents during mining. This information is dissipated to nearby mining sites in order to inform them about any inconsistencies which might occur due to the slope changes on the current site. Results were simulated using HIgh REsolution Slope Stability Simulator (HIRESSS), and an efficiency improvement of 6% is achieved for slope analysis in open cast mines, while probability of accident reduction is increased by 35% when compared to traditional non-IoT based approach. © 2022, (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Although a substantial amount of research has been conducted to address mapping of landslides using Earth observation (EO) data, several gaps and uncertainties remain with developing models to be operational at the global scale. The lack of a high-resolution globally distributed and event-diverse dataset for landslide segmentation poses a challenge in developing machine learning models that can accurately and robustly detect landslides in various regions, as the limited representation of landslide and background classes can result in poor generalization performance of the models. To address this issue, we present the High-Resolution Global landslide Detector Database (HR-GLDD), a high-resolution (HR) satellite dataset (PlanetScope, 3 m pixel resolution) for landslide mapping composed of landslide instances from 10 different physiographical regions globally in South and South-East Asia, East Asia, South America, and Central America. The dataset contains five rainfall-triggered and five earthquake-triggered multiple landslide events that occurred in varying geomorphological and topographical regions in the form of standardized image patches containing four PlanetScope image bands (red, green, blue, and NIR) and a binary mask for landslide detection. The HRGLDD can be accessed through this link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7189381 (Meena et al., 2022a, c). HRGLDD is one of the first datasets for landslide detection generated by high-resolution satellite imagery which can be useful for applications in artificial intelligence for landslide segmentation and detection studies. Five stateof-the-art deep learning models were used to test the transferability and robustness of the HR-GLDD. Moreover, three recent landslide events were used for testing the performance and usability of the dataset to comment on the detection of newly occurring significant landslide events. The deep learning models showed similar results when testing the HR-GLDD at individual test sites, thereby indicating the robustness of the dataset for such purposes. The HR-GLDD is open access and it has the potential to calibrate and develop models to produce reliable inventories using high-resolution satellite imagery after the occurrence of new significant landslide events.

The University of Azuay and highway infrastructure (Cuenca -Ecuador) were affected by slow-moving landslides which in urban areas had more noticeable deformation effects due to their crowns. Furthermore, evidence indicates that the landslide toe was developed in a rural area. To study landslide boundary and deformation kinematics comprehensively, we need to observe two distinct scattering surfaces using SAR imagery (high coherence areas in the urban area and low coherence areas in the rural area). We can also observe different distributions in X-and C-bands due to the rural area covered by vegetation and trees at the toe of the landslide. Two sets of radar images were analyzed and compared for monitoring the aforementioned slow-moving landslide kinematics, including Sentinel1-A (S1 -A) and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK).

The high rate of forest destruction is caused by various factors, including weak law enforcement efforts against forestry crimes, such as illegal logging events. However, in Indonesia, illegal logging is only discovered when the perpetrator has distributed the wood products. The lack of monitoring of the overall condition of the forest has an impact on the current high level of forest destruction. Through this research, the problems related to environmental damage due to illegal logging will be described through remote sensing technology, which is currently mainly developed on the basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning, namely Google Earth Engine (GEE). Monitoring of illegal logging events will be analysed using Sentinel 1 and 2 data. Obtaining satellite imagery with relatively small cloud cover for tropical regions, such as Indonesia, is remarkably difficult. This difficulty is due to the presence of a radar sensor on Sentinel 1 images that can penetrate clouds, allowing for observation of the forest condition even in the presence of clouds. Using the random forest classification algorithm of the GEE platform, data on forest conditions in 2021 were obtained, covering an area of 2,843,938.87 ha or 63% of the total area of Sulawesi Selatan Province. An analysis using a map of the function of forest areas revealed that of the current forest area, 38.46% was non-forest estates and 61.54% was forest areas. The continued identification of illegal logging events also found 1971 spots of forest change events in the vulnerable time of the first period (January-April) with the second period (April-August), and 1680 spots of forest change events in the vulnerable period of the second period (April-August) with the third period (September-December), revealing a total incident area of 7599.28 ha.",FORESTS,10.3390/f14030652,1,1,No,,,Indonesia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taiwan experiences numerous landslides on different scales almost every year. However, Typhoon Morakot (2009), with large-scale landslides that trapped people, demonstrated the importance of an early warning system. The absence of an effective warning system for landslides along with the impossibility of its accurate monitoring highlighted the necessity of landslide rainfall threshold prediction. Accordingly, the prediction of the landslide rainfall threshold as an early warning system could be an effective tool with which to develop an emergency evacuation protocol. The purpose of this study is to present the capability of the deep learning algorithm to determine the distribution of landslide rainfall thresholds in a potential large-scale landslide area and to assess the distribution of recurrence intervals using probability density functions, as well as to assist decision makers in early responses to landslides and reduce the risk of large-scale landslides. Therefore, the algorithm was developed for one of the potential large-scale landslide areas (the Alishan D098 sub-basin), Taiwan, which is classified as a Type II Landslide Priority Area. The historical landslide data, maximum daily rainfall, 11 topographic factors from 2004 to 2017, and the Keras application programming interface (API) python library were used to develop two deep learning models for landslide susceptibility classification and landslide rainfall threshold regression. The predicted result shows the lowest landslide rainfall threshold is located primarily in the northeastern downstream of the Alishan catchment, which poses an extreme risk to the residential area located upstream of the landslide area, particularly if large-scale landslides were to be triggered upstream of Alishan. The landslide rainfall threshold under controlled conditions was estimated at 780 mm/day (20-year recurrence interval), or 820 mm/day (25-year recurrence interval). Since the frequency of extreme rainfall events caused by climate change is expected to rise in the future, the overall landslide rainfall threshold was considered 980 mm/day for the entire area.

Most standard predicting and mapping methods require expert knowledge, supervision, and fieldwork. In this research, the main objective was to analyze the potential of unsupervised machine learning methods and compare the performance of three different unsupervised machine learning models (k-means, spectral clustering, and hierarchical clustering) in modeling the susceptibility of the submarine landslide. Nine groups of geological factors were selected as the input parameters, which were obtained through field surveys. To estimate submarine landslide susceptibility, all input factors were separated into three or four groups based on data features and environmental variables. Finally, the goodness-of-fit and accuracy of models were validated with both internal metrics (CalinskiâHarabasz index, silhouette index, and DaviesâBouldin index) and external metrics (existing landslide distribution, hydrodynamic distribution, and liquefication distribution). The findings of k-means, spectral clustering, and hierarchical clustering performed commendably and accurately in forecasting the submarine landslide susceptibility. Spectral clustering has the greatest congruence with environmental geology parameters. Therefore, the unsupervised machine learning model can be used in submarine-landslide-predicting studies, and the spectral clustering method performed best. Furthermore, machine learning can improve submarine landslide mapping in the future with the development of models and the extension of geological data related to submarine landslides.

Geological data show these bedforms are erosional remnants of older sediments, principally coarse-grained proximal outwash, capped by a thin (<2 m) upper till. Our earlier work ascribed the formation of drumlins and MSGLs to differential erosion of antecedent sediment by a thin layer of deforming subglacial debris (the Erodent Layer Hypothesis) which we now test using new geostatistical and unsupervised machine learning techniques applied to large LiDAR-derived digital topographic datasets. Analysis of more than 1739 streamlined bedforms mapped by Curvature-Based Relief Separation, reveals a statistically-validated continuum of eight morphotypes (M1 to M8) ranging from drumlins to grooved multi-crested drumlins to MSGLs. Furthermore, cluster analysis of the entire morphotype population, reveals three statistically-validated groups that define three streamlined surface types (S1 to S3) which record progressive erosional lowering of the ice stream bed, as drumlins evolve into multi-crested morphotypes, and ultimately MSGLs. Calculation of surface roughness using a technique called Median Absolute Differences (MAD) shows the frictional drag of mega-scale glacially lineated surfaces (S3) is 60% less than drumlinized surfaces (S1). Our findings support earlier ideas that drumlins and MSGLs are âlongitudinal shear marksâ akin to those cut by extended frictional wear on fault planes, to which can now also be added analogous streamlined surfaces cut by wear debris mobilized at the base of landslides, ejecta blankets and pyroclastic flows, and on engineered man-made surfaces.

For instance, capturing historical landslides in densely vegetated areas is still a challenge. This study proposed a deep learning method based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for automatic identification of historical landslides. Additionally, it tested this method in the Jiuzhaigou earthquake-hit region of Sichuan Province (China). Specifically, we generated a Red Relief Image Map (RRIM), which was obtained via high-precision airborne LiDAR data, and on the basis of this information we trained a Lightweight Attention U-Net (LAU-Net) to map a total of 1949 historical landslides. Overall, our model recognized the aforementioned landslides with high accuracy and relatively low computational costs. We compared multiple performance indexes across several deep learning routines and different data types.

Findings indicate that in the early phase, landslide risk management research mainly focused on hazard evaluation and zonation. Then, studies about the spatial predictions of landslides and landslide susceptibility appeared. The research scale of landslides is developing from large scale to fine scale. The use of digital technologies in landslides has been widely discussed since 2009. The use of digital technologies has been developing in the directions of deep learning and artificial intelligence. The monitoring means has been gradually developing from high altitude to low altitude and to ground sensors. Processing technologies are the most widely used in landslide disaster risk research, followed by sensing technologies. Different types of digital technologies play different roles in landslide disasterÂ management. Digital technologies account for a low proportion in the mitigation phase, but contribute the most in the disaster preparation phase. In the future, digital technologies can further strengthen mitigation for and responses to landslide disasters. The application of digital technologies in landslide disaster management should gradually adapt to the needs of the vulnerable group. The government should implement differentiated landslide disaster management according to the regional level of economic development and digital technology development. This study not only reviews the state of the latest technology, but also addresses the future trend of research and provides support for scientists and decision-makers involved in landslide disaster management.

Remote sensing devices are becoming increasingly important in monitoring and assessing natural disaster susceptibility and hazards. The proposed research work pursues an assessment analysis of flood susceptibility in a tropical desert environment: a case study of Yemen. The base data for this research were collected and organized from meteorological, satellite images, remote sensing data, essential geographic data, and various data sources and used as input data into four machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this study, RS data (Sentinel-1 images) were used to detect flooded areas in the study area. We also used the Sentinel application platform (SNAP 7.0) for Sentinel-1 image analysis and detecting flood zones in the study locations. Flood spots were discovered and verified using Google Earth images, Landsat images, and press sources to create a flood inventory map of flooded areas in the study area. Four ML algorithms were used to map flash flood susceptibility (FFS) in Tarim city (Yemen): K-nearest neighbor (KNN), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), random forests (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Twelve flood conditioning factors were prepared, assessed in multicollinearity, and used with flood inventories as input parameters to run each model. A total of 600 random flood and non-flood points were chosen, where 75% and 25% were used as training and validation datasets. The confusion matrix and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were used to validate the susceptibility maps. The results obtained reveal that all models had a high capacity to predict floods (AUC > 0.90). Further, in terms of performance, the tree-based ensemble algorithms (RF, XGBoost) outperform other ML algorithms, where the RF algorithm provides robust performance (AUC = 0.982) for assessing flood-prone areas with only a few adjustments required prior to training the model. The value of the research lies in the fact that the proposed models are being tested for the first time in Yemen to assess flood susceptibility, which can also be used to assess, for example, earthquakes, landslides, and other disasters. Furthermore, this work makes significant contributions to the worldwide effort to reduce the risk of natural disasters, particularly in Yemen. This will, therefore, help to enhance environmental sustainability. Â© 2022 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs14164050,,0,No,,,"China,Morocco,Bangladesh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, this work presents a novel approach, SlideSim, which trains an optical flow predictor for the purpose of mapping 3D landslide displacement using sequential DEM rasters. SlideSim is capable of automated, self-supervised learning by building a synthetic dataset of displacement landslide DEM rasters and accompanying label data in the form of u/v pixel offset flow grids. The effectiveness, applicability, and reliability of SlideSim for landslide displacement monitoring is demonstrated with real-world data collected at a landslide on the Southern Oregon Coast, U.S.A. Results are compared with a detailed ground truth dataset with an End Point Error RMSE = 0.026 m. The sensitivity of SlideSim to the input DEM cell size, representation (hillshade, slope map, etc.), and data sources (e.g., TLS vs. UAS SfM) are rigorously evaluated.

In this study, we evaluated three different locations to assess the generalization capacity of these models in areas with similar and different environmental aspects. The model training consisted of three distinct datasets created with RapidEye satellite images, Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), and a digital elevation model (DEM). Here, we show that larger patch sizes (128 Ã 128 and 256 Ã 256 pixels) favor the detection of landslides in areas similar to the training area, while models trained with smaller patch sizes (32 Ã 32 and 64 Ã 64 pixels) are better for landslide detection in areas with different environmental aspects.

Multicollinearity analysis using the variation inflation factor, tolerance and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) depicted less to no similarity between all factors. Evaluation of variable importance suggests LCFs such as slope, elevation and distance to thrust contributed significantly and consistently for all three models. Model accuracy was determined and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and other statistical signifiers like accuracy, sensitivity, F-measure, accuracy, specificity and recall. The results show that the ensemble algorithms, XGB and RF, yield higher accuracy of approximately 85% compared to the KNN model with 81% accuracy.

On the one hand, we achieve improved feature extraction by utilizing an attention mechanism. On the other hand, based on raw sensing data and labeled results obtained from several regions, we propose a landslide detection model based on the fusion of multisource data, including digital elevation model (DEM), geological mapping data, river distribution data and other data related to earth observation information.

One such climatic extreme, Cyclone Idai (March 2019), caused significant havoc across southeastern Africa, including Mozambique, Malawi, and eastern Zimbabwe, by triggering thousands of landslides and widespread concurrent flooding, both of which resulted in substantial loss of life. The study was conducted in the Chimanimani District of eastern Zimbabwe to understand the impact of Cyclone Idai on landslideÂ initiation, quantify the volume of mobilized hillslope material during the event, and compare the event-triggered material releaseÂ against theÂ annual erosional yield across the study area using machine learning and remote sensing techniques. We evaluated satellite imagery of various resolutions, namely, PlanetScope (3m/px), RapidEye (5m/px), and Sentinel-2 (10m/px) and three machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to identify landslides and compared the efficacy of the models. A total of nine predictor variables derived from the satellite imagery and aÂ 30-m ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model were employed to identify landslides and differentiate them from concurrent hydrological flooding. The models classified the study area into three classes: (i) landslides, (ii) flooding, and (iii) unaffected area. The RF model using PlanetScope satellite data attained the highest prediction accuracy of 97.88%, whereas the accuracy of other machine learningÂ model-satellite data combinations ranged between 94.58 and 97.27%. Subsequently, landslide size thresholds were applied on the initially mapped landslides to eliminate noise and uncertainty from the data before estimating the final Cyclone Idai event-triggered landslide volume. A probability density function, which corresponds to a logarithmic plot of non-cumulative landslide frequency against the mapped landslide area, was employed to calculate landslide size thresholds using divergence and rollover point cutoff values. Finally, a landslide area-to-volume power-law scaling relationship was exploited to derive landslide volumes in the study area that ranged between 6.8 Ã 10 6 to 14.7 Ã 10 6 m3Â and 9.0 Ã 10 6 to 19.6 Ã 10 6 m3 for divergence and rollover point thresholds, respectively, across the different combinations of machine learning models and satellite sensors. The estimated landslide volume indicates hillslope material liberated by Cyclone Idai was 269 to 345 times greater than the estimated annual averageÂ backgroundÂ denudation of the study area computed from a topography-based local erosion model.

They determine not only the positive samples (characterized by the past landslides) but also the negative samples (randomly generated based on past landslides) for training and validating the ML models. However, the number of past landslides is often limited because of the constraints of time, budget, and resources available, etc. In other words, the available data for establishing landslide susceptibility ML models are limited, which indicates that the accuracy and reliability of the corresponding models are insufficient. This article, therefore, proposes using a new landslide susceptibility index-based sampling strategy to enhance the positive and negative samples for model training and validation to reach an improved ML-based LSA. To realize this idea, landslide susceptibility analysis based on initial datasets compiled from landslide inventory by using three ML models, i.e., random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and support vector machine (SVM), are first conducted to obtain the initial landslide susceptibility indices at different space locations. Then, the landslide susceptibility indices are analyzed with the proposed sampling strategy which considers directly the grid units with very high and very low landslide susceptibility indices as potential positive and negative samples, respectively, to enrich the initial dataset; and the number of these positive/negative samples is determined by a Bayesian optimization algorithm. Thereafter, the ML models are updated with the enriched datasets. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, the improved models are applied to assess the landslide susceptibility of Taojiang County, China, and the results are compared with those from initial corresponding models without updating. The results show that compared with the initial RF, GBDT and SVM models, the corresponding improved models have a better performance in accuracy, precision, recall rate, and specificity. In particular, the AUC values of the three models are increased by 11.94%, 10.72% and 0.57%, respectively.

Existing data-driven landslide susceptibility evaluation (LSE) methods overlook environmental heterogeneity and cannot reliably predict regions with few samples. Alternatively, global random negative sampling strategies may produce imbalanced positive and negative samples in some environments, contributing to inaccurate predictions. This article proposes a graph neural network (GNN) constrained by environmental consistency (GNN-EC) to overcome these problems. The GNN-EC consists of graphs with nodes, and edges. A graph represents the environmental relationships in the study area. Nodes are geographic units delineated from terrain polygon approximation. Edges capture the relationships between node-pairs. Additionally, the weights of edges reflect the similarity between two node environments. A GNN aggregates node information in the graph for LSE.

Fast and accurate detection and mapping of these landslides are crucial for rapid risk assessment and humanitarian assistance. Traditional visual interpretation is time-consuming and heavily influenced by human judgement. This paper presents an integrated machine learning (ML) powered method for co-seismic landslide detection, which combines multi-source data, pixel-based and object-based treatments, and ML techniques. The proposed method first fuses multi-source data, including optical images, synthetic aperture radar images and digital elevation models, to produce data layers and reference landslide inventories for learning. After that, ML algorithms are coupled with pixel-based and object-based treatments to produce a series of co-seismic landslide detection models. Powerful models are subsequently recommended after comprehensive evaluation. Two case studies of earthquakes in China are presented. The first is in the epicenter area of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Even trained with only 5% of local data, the proposed method still achieves an accuracy of area (AOA) of 97.77% in the trained area and an AOA of 93.17% in a new area. If trained with the entire local data, an AOA of 99.99% in the trained area and 94.56% in a new area can be obtained. The second case detects the co-seismic landslides induced by the 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake. An AOA of 96.55% is achieved with 5% of local data.

In this study, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for landslide susceptibility assessment, aiming at substantially improving susceptibility prediction using knowledge outside the target domain, especially for regions with limited landslide data. The proposed method first trains a deep learning landslide susceptibility model (i.e., pre-trained model or source model) in a data-rich region (i.e., source domain). Transfer learning techniques are then applied to transfer the knowledge from the source domain to a new region (i.e., target domain) through model transfer and fine-tuning. The transferred model not only carries knowledge from the source domain but is also retrained with data from the target domain, hence achieving a much-improved performance in the new region even with very limited new data. A comprehensive case study in Hong Kong is conducted to investigate the feasibility of the proposed method and the influence of source domain scale on the transfer learning efficiency. Substantial improvements can be found with the proposed method: the accuracies on the test set of the target domain can be increased by 30% and the logarithmic losses can be decreased by 62%. We also reveal that transferring models from larger source domains can accomplish more improvements in both data-rich and data-limited cases. As the very first study that introduces deep transfer learning to landslide susceptibility assessment, the proposed method enables the sharing of landslide knowledge between regions, and is shown to be an intelligent and promising way for improving landslide susceptibility assessment for data-limited regions.

However, the non-landslide samples cannot be directly obtained. In this study, a pattern-based approach is proposed to improve the LSM process, constructing unsupervised machine learning (UML)âsupervised machine learning (SML) collaborative models in which the non-landslide samples can be reasonably selected. Two UML models, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and K-means, are introduced to sample the non-landslide datasets with four sampling selections (abbreviated as A, B, C and D, respectively). Then non-landslide patterns recognised by the UML models are learned by the random forest (RF). A new sensitivity index, accuracy improvement ratio (AIR), is defined to evaluate the superiority of these sampling selections. Compared with the GMM-RF model, the K-means-RF model is more capable of recognising non-landslide patterns and providing sufficient and reliable non-landslide samples. The sampling selection A of the K-means-RF with an AIR value of 2.3 is regarded as the best selection. The results indicate that the UML-SML model based on the pattern-based approach offers an effective strategy to find the non-landslide samples and has a better solution to the LSM.

In the studies of landslide susceptibility, the information of factors used for analysis was usually annual-based content, and it was assumed that the same elements from different years were independent between each year. However, the occurrence of landslides was usually not simply due to the changes within a year. Instead, landslides were triggered because the factors that affected the potential of landslides reached critical conditions after a cumulative change with time. Therefore, this study had well evaluated the influence of temporal characteristics and the ratios of antecedent landslide areas in the past five years in the landslide potential evaluation model. The analysis was conducted through the random forest (RF) algorithm. Additional rainfall events of 2017 were used to test the proposed modelâs performance to understand its practicality. The analysis results show that in the study area, the RF model had considerably acceptable performance.

However, literature review shows that inaccurate landslide point and buffer circle are commonly used as the landslide boundary for landslide susceptibility prediction(LSP), leading to some uncertainties in the LSP results. To study the effects of different landslide boundaries on the LSP modelling, 337 landslides and 10 types of environmental factors in Shangyou County of Jiangxi Province are taken as basic data. The correlations between environmental factors and landslides are built based on different landslide boundaries forms of point, buffer circle and accurate polygonal surface. Next, the multi-layer perceptron(MLP) and random forest(RF) are selected to build six kinds of LSP models, namely, Point, circle and polygon-based MLP and RF models. Finally, three methods are used to analyse the LSP uncertainties, including the ROC accuracy, difference significance analysis and distribution rules of landslide susceptibilityindexs. Results show that:(1) LSP uncertainties will increase under the landslide boundaries of landslide point or buffer circle, while the accuracy and reliability of LSP results will increase under the accurate landslide polygon boundaries. (2) The uncertainty rules of LSP obtained by MLP and RF models are consistent, however, the uncertainty of RF is lower than those of MLP.(3) The LSP results of point and buffer circle based models can also reflect the spatial distribution rules of landslide probability on the whole, and can be used as a substitute scheme in the absence of accurate landslide boundaries.

The presented approach tested a total of 72 runs with different parameter configurations for producing a good outcome among a number of possible solutions by varying population size, tournament group size and mutation probability. The final solution depicted a total of three important variables including slope, wetness index and solar insulation that were used in the prediction. The GP methodology used symbolic expression trees for the development of the predictive models that were tested and validated in the northern portion of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park located in northeast Ohio. The selected solution from the implemented approach showed that the area under the curve from the receiver operating characteristic curves had a high discrimination power in separating the areas with high susceptibility.

In this study, we developed three spatially explicit ensemble predictive models for the prediction of landslide susceptibility in the Muong Nhe district of the Dien Bien Province, Vietnam. The Multiclass Alternating Decision Trees (MADT) method was used as the base classifier with the Dagging, MultiboostAB, and Random Subspace (RSS) as the ensemble learners. The location of past landslides was identified through field surveys and the interpretation of Google Earth images, aerial photographs, and historical archives of the Muong Nhe district. The landslide locations were liked to twelve landslide conditioning factors (slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), geology, flow accumulation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and distance to rivers, roads, and faults) to investigate the spatial patterns of landslide susceptibility across the study area. The results showed that the RSS-MADT model achieved the highest performance in terms of predicting future landslides (AUC = 0.878), followed by DG-MADT (AUC = 0.857), MAB-MADT (AUC = 0.854), and the single MADT model (AUC = 0.828), respectively. Approximately 13% and 10% of the Muong Nhe district were identified as having moderate and severe (high/very high) susceptibility to landslide occurrences. These areas that extend along the rivers, primarily in the central parts of the Muong Nhe district, should be treated with the highest priority to mitigate the negative impacts of future landslides.

Landslide susceptibility analysis is an effective approach for landslide prevention. However, the landslide inventory databases are used when applying current approaches neither contains the potential landslide points in study area nor do they consider ground deformation features in the existing landslide predisposing factors. Therefore, InSAR data were used in this study to substitute the existing landslide databases with 144 historical landside locations in Shuicheng County which could not include potential landslide points. Meanwhile, this study proposed a hybrid deep learning method for landslide susceptibility analysis with the application of InSAR data, involving two parts: (i) The first part concerns the extraction of landslide predisposing factors: in addition to multi-source data such as topography, geomorphology, and hydrology, InSAR data were introduced, and 36 types of landslide predisposing factors with ground deformation features were extracted based on InSAR locations. Multicollinearity test and importance analysis by information gain (IG) for these factors were carried out to obtain landslide predisposing sequence factors. (ii) The second part of the approach followed consists in the construction of prediction model: the hybrid deep learning method integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) and three recurrent neural network (RNN) variants, namely CNN-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), CNN-gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU), and CNN-simple recurrent unit (CNN-SRU). First, the CNN was employed to obtain main affected landslide predisposing sequence factors to reduce the non-influencing features. The landslide prediction model was built with long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) to quantitatively predict landslide susceptibility for generation of landslide susceptibility maps. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), kappa coefficient (KAPPA), and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) were used for model performance evaluation. Compared with the existing methods of CNN-support vector machine (CNN-SVM), CNN-random forest (CNN-RF), and CNN-logistic regression (CNN-LR), the results of the method in this study have higher performance. The CNN-GRU model has the highest precision with an AUC value of 98.4%, an ACC value of 93.7%, a KAPPA value, and a MCC value of 87.4% and 87.5%, respectively, indicating the excellent validity and feasibility of the method in this study.

In view of the problems of the existing landslide hazard susceptibility evaluation model, such as poor effectiveness and inaccuracy of landslide hazard data and the need for experts to participate in the calculation of a large number of evaluation factor weight classification statistics. In this paper, a combined SBAS-InSAR (Small Baseline Subsets-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and PSO-RF (Particle Swarm Optimization-Random Forest) algorithm was proposed to evaluate the susceptibility of landslide hazards in complex mountainous regions characterized by frequent earthquakes, deep river valleys, and large terrain height differences. First, the SBAS-InSAR technique was used to invert the surface deformation rates of the study area and identified potential landslide hazards. Second, the study area was divided into 412,585 grid cells, and the 16 selected environmental factors were analyzed comprehensively to identify the most effective evaluation factors. Last, 2722 landslide (1361 grid cells) and non-landslide (1361 grid cells) grid cells in the study area were randomly divided into a training dataset (70%) and a test dataset (30%). By analyzing real landslide and non-landslide data, the performances of the PSO-RF algorithm and three other machine learning algorithms, BP (back propagation), SVM (support vector machines), and RF (random forest) algorithms were compared.

Due to the severe calamity caused by landslides in the Idukki district during the August 2018 monsoon, the district was listed as one of the top hotspots for landslides, which is why this study focuses on them. Eighteen conditioning factors that influenced the occurrence of the landslides in the Idukki region were considered primarily in this study.

The research focuses on the sensitivity of the causative factors and explores the conditioning parameters that are considered necessary by each machine learning algorithm. Furthermore, the Accuracy, Kappa index, ROC-AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity were computed to estimate the performance of the models. The RF model portrayed the best prediction accuracy in training and testing cases, followed by the AdaBoost and XGBoost models. However, while determining the consistency of the model based on its practical applicability by generating the landslide susceptibility maps, the AdaBoost and NNET model showed better consistency, and the XGBoost model displayed inconsistency.

Firstly, taking Wushan and Wuxi counties in Chongqing as an example, a geospatial dataset comprising 1137 historical landslide locations and preliminary 28 conditioning factors was randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets at each grid resolution. Secondly, spearman correlation coefficient (SCC), recursive feature elimination (RFE) and their combination (SCC-RFE) were chosen to identify the essential conditioning factors out of 28 original factors at five grid resolutions. Subsequently, random forest (RF) model was used to construct landslide susceptibility model with the original and essential conditioning factors, respectively. Finally, the reasonableness of the essential conditioning factors was verified by comparing the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) and other statistical signifiers in multiple grid resolutions. Results show that: (1) Average annual rainfall, elevation, lithology and POI have a significant impact on the occurrence of landslides, while NDVI and land cover has little effect on the occurrence of landslides in Wushan and Wuxi counties. (2) The primary essential factors (i.e., elevation, rainfall) are less affected by the grid resolution, while the subdominant factors (i.e., DEM-derived factors, human activity factors) are strongly influenced. (3) SCC-RFE-RF model performs best with the screened essential conditioning factors at a grid resolution smaller than 2000 m, which indicates choosing the essential conditioning factors or optimum grid resolution can guarantee greater accuracy of landslide susceptibility models.

Mountainous regions are exposed to natural hazards that require modeling to produce multi-hazard maps. Three models were used in this study: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). Seventeen influencing factors are used to map multi-hazards using inventory data. The effectiveness and significance of the factors were determined for both landslides and floods. Model results were compared using area under the curve (AUC), overall hazard accuracy, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and kappa index. The results show that RF has the best performance in predicting landslides with a high AUC of 94.9%, while SVM, LR, and RF have high prediction for floods (AUC of 92.7%, 98%, and 98.7%, respectively).

However, when grid units are used for landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA), the number of landslide samples is quite limited by using geometric points to represent landslides. This situation further leads to a small number of non-landslide samples that are randomly generated based on the landslide samples. This paper proposes a frequency ratio (FR)-based sampling strategy to enhance the information of landslides to achieve an improved machine learning-based LSA. To realize this idea, the FR values of landslide conditioning factors are first calculated, and each grid unit has an attribute dataset composed of FR values. Then, the grid units with the minimum FR value no less than 1 are selected as supplementary positive samples, the grid units with the maximum FR value less than 1 are selected as supplementary negative samples. The enhanced dataset is finally composed of supplementary positive samples and historical landslide points. Thereafter, two typical ML models of the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) are employed to construct the improved LSA models based on the enhanced datasets. Finally, the landslide susceptibility of Anhua County, China, is assessed by the improved ML models, and the results are compared with the ML models trained by the traditional sampling method. The results indicate that compared with traditional RF and SVM models, the corresponding improved models show better performance in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 value.

The Rangit River watershed in Sikkim Himalaya is one of the most landslide-prone areas in India. The main objective of this study was to produce landslide susceptibility maps of the Rangit River watershed using novel ensembles of random forest tree (RFT) with support vector machine (RFT-SVM), artificial neural network (RFT-ANN), naÃ¯ve Bayes tree (RFT-NBT), and logistic model tree (RFT-LMT). An inventory of landslides was created using historical landslide data, government and scientific studies, and Google Earthâs high-resolution satellite images. The landslide/non-landslide locations were split 70/30 for training and validating the models, respectively. Eleven landslide conditioning factors were selected based on their predictive ability, determined using the information gain method, and each factorâs importance was derived. A landslide susceptibility index was then estimated by weighted overlay using a model builder in a GIS (Geographic Information System) environment. Based on the area under the curve and statistical metrics, RFT-LMT was identified as the best model. The results showed that approximately 40% of the Rangit River watershed has high to very high susceptibility to landslides. This studyâs findings will be useful for policy-makers and land use planners in managing and mitigating future landslides in the study area.

The framework of the study comprises two major steps: prediction of geo-hydrological hazard-prone locations (Step-1: hazard/non-hazard), and classification of geo-hydrological hazards by identifying the locations of floods and landslides separately (Step-2: floods/landslides). We used 1326 historically experienced hazard locations (i.e., 726 for floods and 690 for landslides) in the Kentucky River basin, United States, along with the 13 hazard conditioning factors. Extremely randomized trees (ERT) coupled with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) was adopted to provide an effective classification scheme. Based on the predictions of the ERT-PSO in the first step, correctly classified hazard instances were used in the second step of the prediction task to further deepen the machine learning application. The results revealed a strong agreement between the predicted and observed hazard locations with an AUROC of 0.8032 and 0.8845 for geo-hydrological hazard (Step-1) and flood/landslide classifications (Step-2), respectively. The proposed hybrid prediction framework introduced considerably accurate performance as 73.78% and 72.91% of the hazard and non-hazard classes were correctly identified at Step-1, respectively, while at Step-2, 72.31% of the flooding points and 84.85% of the landslide points were ascertained accurately. Overall findings emerged from Step-1 illustrated that nearly 10% of the entire basin is susceptible to geo-hydrological hazards with very high probability, whereas very low susceptible areas cover only 20% of the basin. A model-agnostic game-theory based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was employed to anatomize the contribution of hazard conditioning factors on the incident outcome predictions aiding to increase the interpretability of the adopted methodology. The holistic approach adopted in the present research has significant potential in providing insights into the practical and theoretical grounds of the literature.

Deep belief networks (DBN) is a commonly used deep learning model, and the DBN hyperparameter determination problem is the key to its application. To improve the accuracy of regional landslide susceptibility prediction, this paper introduces the particle swarm algorithm (PSO) to determine the hyperparameters of the DBN; this is applied to regional landslide susceptibility prediction. Firstly, PSO is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the DBN and obtain a set of hyperparameters with the optimal fitness function. A landslide susceptibility prediction model based on PSO-DBN is then constructed and the K-fold cross-validation method is used to determine its accuracy. The model is applied to landslide susceptibility prediction in the most impacted area of the Wenchuan earthquake to analyze the modelâs accuracy. Finally, model susceptibility analysis is performed. The research results show that the final optimal model accuracy of the PSO-DBN model is 95.52%, which is approximately 28.31% and 15.35% higher than that of the logistic regression (LR) model and the common DBN model, respectively. The Kappa coefficient is 0.883, which is higher than that of the LR model. Compared with the LR model and the common DBN model, Kappa coefficient is improved by approximately 0.542 and 0.269 respectively; the area under the curve (AUC) is 0.951, which is improved by approximately 0.201 and 0.080 compared to the LR model and the common DBN model. The susceptibility of the model to the inertia factor is low, the average change in model accuracy (when the inertia factor changes by 0.1) is approximately 0.1%, and the overall stability of the model is high. The landslide susceptibility level is very high. The area includes 219 landslide points, which account for 39.2% of total landslide points. In the area with a high level of landslide susceptibility are 191 landslide points, accounting for 34.2% of total landslide points. Together, the two contain approximately 73.4% of the landslide points. This indicates that the model prediction results agree well with the spatial distribution characteristics of the landslide.

Simultaneous occurrence of rainfall and seismic activity increases the likelihood of landslides. However, the researchers focused on this aspect are not much. In the present research, a hybrid model was developed to predict the landslide occurrences probability in Atsuma, Japan triggered by rainfalls and earthquakes. The proposed model is a combination of a physical and machine learning model for improving the accuracy of the landslide susceptibility mapping. The proposed model consisted of a physical module, a machine learning module and a matrix approach module. The physical module assessed the effects of rainfall and peak ground acceleration (PGA) on landslide occurrence probability based on a pseudo-static model. The machine learning module applied Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks to assess landslide susceptibility, using 611 landslide events caused by strong earthquakes and extreme typhoons. The landslide susceptibility maps obtained from these two modules were then combined into final susceptibility map through a matrix approach. The final susceptibility map included five susceptible levels: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. To evaluate the proposed model performance, the resulting models were assessed using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. The areas under the success rate curves from the physical module, machine learning module and matrix-based approach showed 79.2%, 82.7% and 83.9% accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, the predicted rate curves showed that the areas under the curve for physical module, machine learning module and matrix-based approach were 78.4%, 82.3% and 83.4%, respectively. These results suggest that the proposed hybrid model improves the prediction capability compared to physically-based method or machine learning model and can be readily used to assess spatial probability of landslide.

There are many methods for LSM, including statistical methods, traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods, etc. However, the difference comparison of these methods has been not perfect, especially the comparison of different neural network models for LSM and their application prospects were rarely studied. In this paper, the classical neural net-work multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) four models are selected for comparison. Taking Lanzhou city, Gansu Province, China as an example, eight landslide-related influencing factors and historical landslide and non-landslide locations were selected, and the training set and validation set were divided according to 7:3. Through training the four models, four landslide susceptibility maps were generated. The experimental results were verified and compared by the confusion matrix, Kappa coefficient, F1-score and other statistical indicators. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Precision-Recall (PR) curve were plotted to evaluate the classification effect and generalization capability of four models. The results show that the constructed MSCNN is the optimal model, which has the best performance both in the training process and in the mapping results. MSCNN model has the highest value of Recall (99.93%), Kappa (0.96) and F1-score (0.98) in the confusion matrix. In addition, ROC curve and PR curve of MSCNN model maintain the maximum area under curve (AUC) on different data sets. In the comparison, MLP and GRU accept sequence features, while CNN and MSCNN accept neighborhood features. In general, the prediction model considering neighborhood features contains more information in the limited input data and is better than the prediction model considering sequence features in all evaluation indicators. Therefore, we think that the neighborhood features can better represent the landslide occurrence characteristics. In the future model design process for LSM, more attention should be paid to the neighborhood features of landslide influencing factors.

The implemented method consisted of an artificial neural network multilayer perceptron (ANN MLP), generated with the neuralnet R package, with which, by means of different backpropagation algorithms (RPROP+, RPROP?, SLR, SAG, and Backprop), five landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) were generated for the study area.

Initially, four bivariate approaches, viz., information value (InfoV), evidential belief function (EBF), certainty factor (CF), and index of entropy methods (IoE), were applied to model landslide susceptibility, and the accuracy was estimated. Thereafter, these models were integrated with random forest (RF) to build hybrid models. The computed hybrid models were evaluated using ROCâAUC and confusion matrix-based statistical measures. Hybrid models show higher accuracy with ROCâAUC values ranging from 0.894 to 0.928 in the training phase and 0.906 to 0.925 in the testing phase.

Within this region, northwestern Iran is of high importance. Before proper planning for mitigating the earthquake-induced hazards can be achieved, it is necessary to identify high-risk areas in terms of susceptibility to earthquakes. In this study, landslide susceptibility in Miandoab Country was modeled using the so-called random forest algorithm (RFA) in MATLAB based on records acquired at 67 earthquake hotspots considering 9 factors affecting the earthquake occurrence (i.e., height, slope, direction, distance from fault, distance from river, distance from road, land use, geology, and precipitation). Predictive power of the model and validity of its results were evaluated using relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC). The assessment results showed very good accuracy of the model (0.97). It was further found that digital height layer, geology, and distance from fault impose the largest contributions into earthquake potential. The results also showed that 53%, 8.3%, and 38.4% of the study area were classified as being at low risk, moderate risk, and high risk of earthquake. Among other climatic elements, the precipitation exhibits the largest fluctuations; we proceeded to evaluate precipitation trends in the study area for a statistical period of 30Â years.

First, 159 landslides and 72 debris flows were mapped in the Helong city are based on the geological disaster investigation and regionalization (1:50,000) project of Helong City. Then, twelve landslide conditioning factors and eleven debris flow conditioning factors were selected as the modeling variables. Among them, the transcendental probability of Changbai Mountain volcanic earthquake greater than VI degrees was used to indicate the relationship between the geological hazard-susceptibility and Changbai Mountain volcanic earthquake occurrence. Furthermore, two machine learning models (SVM and ANN) were introduced to geological hazard-susceptibility modeling.

Based on the modeling results, the SVM model is the better model for both the landslide and debris flow susceptibility mapping.

Moreover, the changing climate is assumed to have an impact on landslide occurrences in the future. The aim of this study is to conduct the first landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in Denmark, reducing the geographical bias existing in LSM studies, and to identify areas prone to landslides in the future following representative concentration pathway RCP8.5, based on a set of explanatory variables in an area of interest located around Vejle Fjord, Jutland, Denmark. A subset from the landslide inventory provided by GEUS is used as ground truth data. Three well-established machine learning (ML) algorithmsâRandom Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regressionâwere trained to classify the data samples as landslide or non-landslide, treating the ML task as a binary classification and expressing the results in the form of a probability in order to produce susceptibility maps. The classification results were validated through the test data and through an external data set for an area located outside of the region of interest. While the high predictive performance varied slightly among the three models on the test data, the LR and SVM demonstrated inferior accuracy outside of the study area. The results show that the RF model has robustness and potential for applicability in landslide susceptibility mapping in low-lying landscapes of Denmark in the present. The conducted mapping can become a step forward towards planning for mitigative and protective measures in landslide-prone areas in Denmark, providing policy-makers with necessary decision support. However, the map of the future climate change scenario shows the reduction of the susceptible areas, raising the question of the choice of the climate models and variables in the analysis.

To overcome this problem, the Incremental Learning theory combined with a Bayesian Network (ILBN) model is constructed for LSP. Wencheng County of China is taken as the study area, a landslide inventory from 1985 to 2019 and 10 conditioning factors are mapped and analyzed. Then, the LSP results of the ILBN model are compared with the batch learning-based multilayer perceptron (BL-MLP) and support vector machine (BL-SVM) models. Results show that the LSP accuracies of ILBN_0 (ILBN modeling of initial landslide inventory), ILBN_1 (the first Incremental Learning model), and ILBN_2 (the second Incremental Learning model) increase gradually with the AUC value of 0.807, 0.813, and 0.835, respectively. The LSM produced by the ILBN model is more consistent with the law of landslides distribution in the study area. The mean values of ILBN_0, ILBN_1, and ILBN_2 are 0.307, 0.287, and 0.245, and the standard deviations are 0.278, 0.281, and 0.308, respectively. Meanwhile, the characteristics of LSIs in Wencheng County are in line with the actual landslides distribution with the main controlling factors of lithology, elevation, and normalized difference building indexes determined by the weighted mean method. Furthermore, the LSP results of ILBN model are superior to those of the BL-MLP and BL-SVM models. It is concluded that the ILBN model can better address the long-term, continuous LSP using the new added landslide inventory.

Generally, the main selection methods include randomly selecting from the whole study area or from the specific attribute areas such as low slopes. The negative samples selected by the above methods are often inaccurate or biased, resulting in low accuracy and low reliability of LSP. To solve this problem, the coupling model of ML and information value (IV) method was proposed for LSP. Taking Ruijin City as the study area, the attribute values of the environmental factors were transformed into the IV values of the contribution to the landslide to obtain the very low and low susceptibility areas. The negative samples were randomly selected in the above areas for the training and validation of machine learning models. The new coupling models of IV-SVM and IV-RF were constructed for the LSP of Ruijin. Further, IV-SVM and IV-RF models were compared with the single SVM and RF model with negative samples randomly selected from the whole study area, as well as the low-slope SVM and RF model with negative samples randomly selected from specific attribute areas with a slope less than 2Â°. Finally, Kappa coefficient (KC) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to verify and compare the modeling results. The AUC values of the ROC curve and KC of IV-SVM and IV-RF models were 0.828, 0.920 and 0.876, 0.988, which were higher than those of single SVM, RF model and low-slope SVM, RF model, respectively. Meanwhile, IV-SVM and IV-RF models have a smaller mean value and larger standard deviation of a susceptibility probability distribution. Results showed that: 1) IV-SVM and IV-RF models had the higher LSP accuracies than those of the single SVM, RF model and low-slope SVM, RF model, respectively; 2) RF model had higher LSP accuracy compared to the SVM model; 3) The coupling model such as IV-RF could address the inaccuracy of negative sample sampling existing in the single model and the shortcomings of the low slope model in the selection of slope interval, thus improving the LSP accuracy. In conclusion, this study provided a new idea for the negative sample sampling method for LSP using ML models. Copyright Â©2022 Advanced Engineering Sciences.

One of the possible means of reducing the negative impact of landslides on peopleâs lives or property is to recognize areas that are prone to their occurrence. The most common approach to this problem is preparing landslide susceptibility maps. These can factor in the actual location of landslides or the causal relationship between landslides and selected environmental factors. Creating a classification of landslide-prone areas is a challenging task when landslide density is not high and the area of analysis is large. We prepared shallow 10Â m Ã 10Â m resolution landslide susceptibility maps of the Wi?nickie Foothills (Western Carpathians, Poland) using eleven different machine learning algorithms derived from the Python libraries Scikit-learn and Imbalanced-Learn. The analyzed area is characterized by a mean density of 3.4 surficial landslides (composed of soils and rocks) per km2. We also compared different approaches to imbalanced sets of data: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, ExtraTrees (Extremely Randomized Trees), Easy Ensemble, Balanced Bagging, Balanced Random Forest, RUSBoost and a hybrid model combining Random Under Sampler and Multi-layer Perceptron algorithms. The environmental factors (slope inclination and aspect, distance from rivers, lithology, soil type and permeability, groundwater table depth, profile and plan curvature, mean annual rainfall) were categorized and divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Accuracy, recall, G-mean and area under receiver operating curve (AUC) were used to validate the quality of the models. The results confirmed that algorithms based on decision tree classifiers are suitable for preparing landslide susceptibility maps. We also found that methods that generate random undersampling subsets (Easy Ensemble, Balanced Bagging, RUSBoost) and ensemble methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Extra-Trees) both yield very similar test results to those that use full sets of data for training. Relatively high-quality results can also be obtained by integrating the Random Under Sampler algorithm with the Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm.

In addition, differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) technology was used for a hazard assessment. The accuracy of the random forest is 0.903 and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve is 0.96. The results show that 16% and 22% of the slope units were classified as being at very high and high-susceptibility levels for landslides, respectively, whereas 16% and 24% of the slope units were at very high and high-hazard levels for landslides, respectively. The landslide risk was obtained based on the susceptibility map and hazard map of landslides. The results show that only 26% of the slope units were located at very high and high-risk levels for landslides and these are mainly concentrated in urban centers. Such risk zones should be taken seriously and their dynamics must be monitored.

Recently, algorithms that utilize artificial intelligence have come into prominence. This study attempts to adapt the most fundamental framework of deep learning and introduces fuzzy theory concepts to analyze landslide susceptibility while updating the network parameters with trial-and-error methods. The final analysis results will compare with those of logistic regression (LR). In order to assess the ability of the model to identify landslides in a more objective way, two typhoon events were used as a training event and a validation event, respectively. The results of the analysis show that the area under the curve (AUC) of the fuzzy neural network (FNN) for the training event is 0.915, but the AUC for the validation event drops to 0.746. Although the results of the FNN for training events were better than those of LR, they did not differ much from those of LR in predicting future events. The reason for this is that the difference between the landslide distributions of the training and validation events is too large, making the model biased in its identification. Overall, FNN is still a recommended method for analyzing landslide potential and can be used as a reference for LR. Â© 2022 by the authors.

We evaluated and tested a limit equilibrium approach to produce a local-scale, multi-temporal geographic information system-based landslide hazard map that utilized satellite soil moisture data, soil strength and hydrologic data, and a high-resolution (1.5Â m) LiDAR-derived digital elevation map. The final multi-temporal landslide hazard map was validated temporally and spatially using four study sites at known landslide locations and failure dates. The resulting product correctly indicated low factor of safety values at the study sites on the dates the landslide occurred. Also, we produced a regional-scale landslide susceptibility map using a logistic regression machine learning model using 15 variables derived from the geomorphology, soil properties, and land-cover data. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve was used for the accuracy of the model, which yielded a success rate of 0.84. We show that using publicly available data, a multi-temporal landslide hazard map can be created that will produce a close-to-real-time landslide predictive map. The landslide hazard map provides an understanding into the evolution of landslide development temporally and spatially, whereas the landslide susceptibility map indicates the probability of landslides occurring at specific locations. When used in tandem, the two mapping models are complementary to each other. Specifically, the landslide susceptibility mapping identifies the area most susceptible to landslides, while the landslide hazard mapping predicts when landslide may occur within the identified susceptible area.

Therefore, preparing of landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) with the sound methods is a preliminary task for the safe and sustainable land use planning and design. In this research, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was integrated with the pre-existing machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Radial Basis Functional Neural Network (RBF-net), Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree), Random Tree, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and M5tree to increase their efficiency and accuracy of prediction of landslide susceptibility in Kottiyam town of Kerala. For the advancement of the ongoing research, a total of 189 landslide locations were analysed and datasets were obtained. To prepare LSMs, 70% of the total datasets was utilized for training and the rest 30% was used for the validation purposes. In this research, methods like: ROC, Precision, Proportion Incorrectly Classify, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Taylor diagram were applied for the validation of the models. Based on the prior pieces of literature, a total of twelve landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were chosen. However, none of them found to be possessing multi-collinearity. It is challenging to select features from a dataset through optimization. In this regards PSO is effective because, it is straightforward with efficient universal optimization techniques. The PSO algorithm has updated and optimized the weights of models, and as results, the efficiency of the used models in predicting landslide susceptibility has increased. Nearly, 13% of the study area is very highly susceptible to landslide. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the Random Tree-PSO integrated model is the highest, 86.38% for the training dataset and 88.05% for the validation dataset. According to the sensitivity analysis elevation is most sensitive factor (0.285) and curvature is very less sensitive factor (0.115). As a result, it can be concluded that, of all the models evaluated, it is the most suitable for predicting a landslide tragedy.

Subsequently, the temperature difference and precipitation weakening the geotechnical body were regarded as the triggering factors of landslides in cold regions, and their marginal distribution and interdependence were determined based on the copula theory to develop the joint distribution from the perspective of exceedance probability. Landslide hazard under different return periods (T = 5, 10, 20, and 50Â years) was then identified in terms of the product of the permanent environment and the triggering factor.

To facilitate the increased amount of biomass harvesting adequately, the existing road network may require modifications to allow forest transportation within harvesting units that are not yet accessed by the roads. The construction of a forest road can trigger landslides, so the necessary constraints should be considered when the road is being planned to preclude such problems. Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM) has become an integral part of the growing process of machine learning (ML), providing a more effective platform for practitioners, planners, and decision-makers. This study aims to reveal the most suitable alternative routes for a forest road, especially in areas susceptible to landslides, and to provide an effective tool for decision-makers. Results: For this purpose, two models were developed through ML: Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF). Elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), distance from the fault, the road, and the stream, and lithology were considered as the main landslide susceptibility factors in these models. The best model was obtained by the RF approach with an Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) value of 81.9%, while the LR model was 78.2%. LSM data was used as a base, and alternative routes were obtained through CostPath analysis. Conclusion: It has been shown that the ML methods used in this study can positively contribute to decision-making by providing more effective LSM calculations in studies to determine alternative routes in a forest road network.

Fairness, and transparency becomes ever more vital due to ethical concerns and trust. Despite the popularity of machine learning (ML) algorithms in landslide modeling, the explainability of these methods are often considered as black box. This paper aims to propose an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for landslide prediction using synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) time-series data, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) time-series data and other geo-environmental factors such as DEM (digital elevation model) derivatives. We employed a Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) approach to understand how and what decisions ML-based models are making. 37 features were extracted from various sources such as ALOS-PALSAR (ALOS Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar), ALOS-2 (SAR), Landsat-8, topographic maps, and DEM for landslide susceptibility mapping in a landslide prone area in Chukha, Bhutan as a test site. The result was then compared using two standard ML methods: random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). As per results, the RF model outperformed (0.914) the SVM. Moreover, the higher reliability of the RF model was proved by the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.941. XAI results revealed, features like altitude, aspect, NDVI-2014, NDVI-2017, and NDVI-2018 were the most effective features for landslide prediction by both models. Interestingly, among those features, NDVI-2014, aspect, and NDVI-2017 negatively correlated with the landslide prediction; whereas positively correlated when SVM was utilized. This interpretation ability indicates the advantages of XAI over the conventional methods as it measures the impact, interaction and correlation of conditioning factors within a model. The current research finding can provide more transparency and explainability when working with MLs in landslide studies. This could help to build trust among the geoscientists and decision-makers while making geohazard prediction.

Machine learning (ML) techniques are most advanced and precise methods to develop landslide susceptibility model (LSM). The current study was designed to analyze and assess the landslide susceptibility using ML approaches for District Hattian Bala, NW Himalayas, Pakistan. The historical satellite imageries are used to generate spatiotemporal landslide inventories of year 2005, 2007 and 2012. A spatial database was created pertaining to topographic, environmental, geologic, and anthropogenic factors including slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, plane curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, distance to faults, distance to streams, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use/ land cover (LULC). These LCFs were selected to analyze periodic landslide susceptibility in the region. The experimental design utilized 349, 393, and 735 landslide inventory of 2005, 2007, and 2012 respectively. Two ML models, i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) were applied to assess landslide susceptibility determine by thirteen landslide causative factors (LCFs). The spatiotemporal landslide inventory was partitioned into training (70%) and testing (30%) landslides for respective years to check the prediction accuracies of selected ML models. Comparative analysis of different LSMs was performed by the Receiver Operator Curves â Area Under Curves (ROC-AUC). The resultant accuracy, MAE, RMSE, Kappa, Precision, Recall, F1 indicated that RF outperformed the LR model. The study aims to minimize losses to lives and potential economic damage linked with recurrent slope instabilities in the region.

In recent years, a lot of research on LSP has focused on machine learning algorithms, and the ensemble learning algorithm is a new direction to build the optimal prediction. Logistic model tree (LMT) combines the advantages of decision tree and logistic regression, which is smaller and more robust than ordinary algorithms. The main aim of this study is to construct and test LMT-based random forest (RF) and selected ensemble learning algorithms including bagging and boosting algorithms to compare their performance. Firstly, taking the county of Ziyang, China, as the study area, through historical reports, aerial-photo interpretations, and field investigations, 690 inventory maps of landslide locations were constructed and randomly divided into the 70/30 ratio for a training and validation dataset. Secondly, considering geological conditions, and landslide-induced disease and its characteristics, 14 landslide-conditioning factors was selected. Thirdly, the variance-inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance (TOL) were used to analyze the 14 factors, and the prediction ability was calculated with information-gain technology. Ultimately, the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to verify and compare model performance. Results showed that the LMT-RF model (0.897) was superior to other models, and the performance of LMT single model (0.791) was the worst. Therefore, it can be inferred that the LMT-RF model is a promising model, and the outcome of this study will be useful to planners and scientists in landslide sensitivity studies in similar situations.

Understanding the spatial distribution of the landslides triggered by the first earthquake can help us predict the landslide susceptibility for subsequent shakes over a short term. This study used two landslide inventories from the Lombok earthquake sequence in Indonesia in 2018 to construct a short-term secondary disaster prediction model and an overall spatial prediction model using four machine learning algorithms. The average accuracy of the positive samples predicted by the prediction model was 7.1% lower than that of the short-term model. The highest accuracy of the overall prediction model was 14.9% higher, on average, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) score was 8.1% higher, on average, but the corresponding probability thresholds were lower. The reason for this difference is that, in the short-term prediction model, since most of the landslides in the first landslide inventory were prone to fail two or more times due to the effect of multiple earthquakes, the prediction results have a high positive rate. This feature of the short-term prediction model makes it suitable for landslide rescue guidance in a sequence of earthquakes. In contrast, the overall prediction model can better represent the spatial distribution of the earthquake-triggered landslides in the area.

Using a typical mountainous county, Chengkou, as a case study, a landslide inventory was prepared based on field investigations, satellite images, and historical records. In total, 334 landslides were identified. Twenty landslide conditioning factors influenced by topography, geology, environmental conditions, and human activities were initially identified. Less important conditioning factors were identified and eliminated using a geographical detector. Two common non-linear machine-learning models (RF and SVM) were used under the grid and slope units, and on all cells (including landslides and non-landslides); 10-fold cross-validation was utilized to select the training and validation datasets for these models. Subsequently, the trained models were utilized for landslide susceptibility mapping in the entire study area, divided into five classes. Subsequently, the performance of the models under different units was evaluated using a confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve. Finally, partial dependency plots (PDP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) were used to study the interpretability of landslide susceptibility model. The research results show that after removing the noise-generating factors, the model trained by the remaining 11 landslide-conditioning factors can deliver ideal forecast accuracy. In this study, the evaluation results of the slope unit for the RF or SVM model were more accurate and reasonable than those of the grid unit. In this case, the slope unit was found to be ideal. Under both the slope and grid units, the performance of the RF model was better than that of the SVM model. This study provides a reference for the spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility along mountain highways.

This study explores two metaheuristic-algorithms, i.e., artificial bee colony (ABC), and artificial fish swarm (AFS), for the optimization of artificial neural network (ANN) model. These two algorithms are integrated with ANN model to find its optimal computational parameters for landslide susceptibility mapping in the Penang Island, Malaysia. The spatial database contains twelve landslide causative factors. In this study, 382 landslide events occurred, and they are divided into two parts: two-third for train data and one-third for test data. The pre-processing technique is frequently used in machine learning approach to enhance the efficiency of a model. Therefore, the normalization and principal component analysis (PCA) are applied on the spatial database to eliminate the redundant and overlapping instances. The mean squared error (MSE), classification accuracy (Acc), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve are used to evaluate the comprehensive performance of the proposed models. The obtained AUROC value of the ABC-ANN model is 96.99%, which is higher than that of AFS-ANN (96.66%) and ANN (96.43%) models. The integrated models can produce the satisfactory results for this study area. It is deduced from the obtained results that the predictive ability of ABC-ANN model is better in optimizing the computational parameters and structure of ANN model as compared to AFS-ANN. The resulting landslide susceptibility maps offer the important information for the assessment of landslide risks in this study area.

This research analyzes the effectiveness of alternative landslide partitioning techniques on LSM in the landslide-prone district, Muzaffarabad, Pakistan. We developed a landslide inventory of 961 landslides and then traditionally divided it into training (672; 70%) and testing (289; 30%) samples. These training samples (672) are processed by the Average Nearest Neighbour Index (ANNI) method to estimate the spatial pattern of landslides in nature. The results provide an ANNI ratio of 0.672 confirming that the landslides distribution pattern is cluster in the complex Himalayan terrain of Muzaffarabad. Among 672, the majority of landslides (529; 79%) depict cluster behaviour, while 189 landslides (21%) depict random behaviour. To evaluate the effectiveness of landslide cluster samples in prediction, five machine learning algorithms (MLAs), that is, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Logistic Regression (LR) using proposed cluster (529) and traditional (672) random training samples along with 17 geo-environmental factors are executed. However, testing samples (289; 30%) separated at the initial stage remained the same to check the modelâs effectiveness. The areas under the curve (AUC-ROC), sensitivity, specificity, Kappa index and accuracy (ACC) have been used to evaluate the MLAâs performances. An alternative partitioning technique (cluster) shows the highest predictive power with AUC-ROC values ranging from 0.96 to 0.86, Kappa index ranges from 0.76 to 0.60 and ACC ranges from 0.90 to 0.83. Conversely, the random partitioning approach performs less well with AUC-ROC values ranging from 0.95 to 0.83, Kappa index ranges from 0.70 to 0.49 and ACC ranges from 0.87 to 0.80. In comparison, the RF cluster sampling-based model outperforms the other models and their counterparts. The RF model achieved the highest accuracy (0.902), highest AUC (0.962) and highest Kappa index (0.755) followed by XGboost having ACC (0.885), AUC (0.95) and Kappa index (0.724) employing proposed cluster training samples. However, traditional random training samples yield comparatively low ACC of RF (0.868) and XGboost (0.862). These results confirm that cluster training sampling performs well in obtaining reliable and precise LSMs for complex Himalayan terrain. Although random landslide partitioning for training datasets is seldom utilized in LSM, this study highlights that cluster partitioning for landslide training datasets might be a realistic and reliable approach.

Therefore, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) can play a critical role in identifying prone areas and reducing the damage caused by landslides in each area. In the present study, deep learning algorithms including convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were used to identify landslide prone areas in Ardabil province, Iran. Then 312 landslide locations were identified and randomly divided into train and test datasets, and according to previous studies and environmental conditions in the study area, twelve factors affecting the occurrence of landslides were selected. The ratio of the importance of each influential factor in landslide occurrence was obtained through information gain ranking filter method and it was found that land-use and profile curvature had the highest and lowest impacts, respectively. Afterwards, LSMs were generated using CNN and LSTM algorithms. In the next step, the performance of the models was evaluated based on the area under curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristics curve and the root mean square error (RMSE) method. The AUC values for CNN and LSTM models were 0.821 and 0.832, respectively. Furthermore, the RMSE values in the CNN model for each of the training and testing dataset were 0.121 and 0.132, respectively. The RMSE values in the LSTM model for each of the training and testing dataset were 0.185 and 0.188, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that LSTM performance is slightly better than CNN; but in general, both models have close performance and the accuracy of both models is acceptable.

The production of landslide maps is mainly based on manual visual interpretation methods of aerial and satellite images combined with field surveys. In recent times, advances in machine learning methods have made it possible to explore new semi-automated landslide detection methodologies using remotely detected images. In this sense, developing new artificial intelligence models based on Deep Learning (DL) opens up an excellent opportunity to automate this arduous process. Although the Andes mountain range is one of the most geomorphologically active areas on the planet, the few investigations that use DL mainly focus on mountain ranges in Europe and Asia. One of the main reasons is the low density of landslide data available in the Andean areas, making it difficult to experiment with DL models requiring large data volumes. In this work, we seek to narrow the existing gap in the availability of landslide inventories in the area of the Patagonian Andes. In addition, the feasibility and efficiency of DL techniques are studied to develop landslide detection models in the Andes from the generated datasets. To achieve this goal, we generated in a manual process a datasets of 10,000 landslides for northern Chilean Patagonia (42-45 degrees S), being the largest freely accessible landslide datasets in this region. We implement a machine learning model, through DL, to detect landslides in optical images of the Sentinel-2 constellation using a model based on the DeepLabv3+ architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning network for semantic segmentation. Our results indicate that the algorithm detects landslides with an accuracy of 0.75 at the object level.

The landslide semantic segmentation of a remote sensing image based on deep learning mainly uses supervised learning, the accuracy of which depends on a large number of training data and high-quality data annotation. At this stage, high-quality data annotation often requires the investment of significant human effort. Therefore, the high cost of remote sensing landslide image data annotation greatly restricts the development of a landslide semantic segmentation algorithm. Aiming to resolve the problem of the high labeling cost of landslide semantic segmentation with a supervised learning method, we proposed a remote sensing landslide semantic segmentation with weakly supervised learning method combing class activation maps (CAMs) and cycle generative adversarial network (cycleGAN). In this method, we used the image level annotation data to replace pixel level annotation data as the training data. Firstly, the CAM method was used to determine the approximate position of the landslide area. Then, the cycleGAN method was used to generate the fake image without a landslide, and to make the difference with the real image to obtain the accurate segmentation of the landslide area. Finally, the pixel-level segmentation of the landslide area on remote sensing image was realized. We used mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) to evaluate the proposed method, and compared it with the method based on CAM, whose mIOU was 0.157, and we obtain better result with mIOU 0.237 on the same test dataset. Furthermore, we made a comparative experiment using the supervised learning method of a u-net network, and the mIOU result was 0.408. The experimental results show that it is feasible to realize landslide semantic segmentation in a remote sensing image by using weakly supervised learning. This method can greatly reduce the workload of data annotation.",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs14153650,0,0,No,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owning to their special advantages, neural network algorithms have been widely used for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in recent decades. In the present study, three advanced neural network models popularly used in relevant studies, i.e. artificial neural network (ANN), one dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), were evaluated and compared for LSM practice over the Qingchuan County, Sichuan province, China. Extensive experimental results demonstrated satisfactory performances of these three neural network models in accurately predicting susceptible regions. Specifically, ANN and 1D CNN models yielded quite consistent LSM results but slightly differed from those of RNN model spatially. Nevertheless, accuracy evaluations revealed that the RNN model outperformed the other two models both qualitatively and quantitatively but its complexity was relatively high. Experiments concerning training hyper-parameters on the performance of neural network models for LSM suggested that relatively small batch size values with Tanh activation function and SGD optimizer are essential to improve the performance of neural network models for LSM, which may provide a thread to help those who apply these advanced algorithms to improve their efficiency.

We determine the locations of shallow landslides across different sites to better understand regional differences and to identify their triggering causal factors. Ten sites across Switzerland located in the Alps (eight sites), in foothill regions (one site) and the Jura Mountains (one site) were selected for statistical evaluations. For the shallow-landslide inventory, we used aerial images (0.25 m) with a deep learning approach (U-Net) to map the locations of eroded sites. We used logistic regression with a group lasso variable selection method to identify important explanatory variables for predicting the mapped shallow landslides. The set of variables consists of traditional susceptibility modelling factors and climate-related factors to represent local as well as cross-regional conditions. This set of explanatory variables (predictors) are used to develop individual-site models (local evaluation) as well as an all-in-one model (cross-regional evaluation) using all shallow-landslide points simultaneously. While the local conditions of the 10 sites lead to different variable selections, consistently slope and aspect were selected as the essential explanatory variables of shallow-landslide susceptibility. Accuracy scores range between 70.2 % and 79.8 % for individual site models. The all-in-one model confirms these findings by selecting slope, aspect and roughness as the most important explanatory variables (accuracy Combining double low line 72.3 %). Our findings suggest that traditional susceptibility variables describing geomorphological and geological conditions yield satisfactory results for all tested regions. However, for two sites with lower model accuracy, important processes may be under-represented with the available explanatory variables. The regression models for sites with an east-west-oriented valley axis performed slightly better than models for north-south-oriented valleys, which may be due to the influence of exposition-related processes. Additionally, model performance is higher for alpine sites, suggesting that core explanatory variables are understood for these areas.

Recently, many remote-sensing-based methods have been developed for landslide detection. However, many existing methods rely on multitemporal/multisource data, which require tedious data collection work and limit their practical capacity in real-time emergencies. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised single-image-based landslide detection (USILD) method to automatically and quickly locate landslides and evaluate landslide risks, which can provide timely data for urban landslide responses. This method is designed to take full advantage of the visual salience and reflectance characteristics of landslides to produce a landslide risk map. Morphological processing is used to refine the final maps. The method is implemented and applied to the recent Ludian landslide event, in which hundreds of landslides occurred, on August 3, 2014. High-resolution satellite and aerial images obtained with sensor technology provided suitable experimental materials for this study. The experimental results show that our method can achieve higher accuracy and more automatic processing than other methods such as change detection using image differencing (CDD), change detection using ratio (CDR), k-means, and support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, the method requires no training samples and has a lower computational cost than supervised learning algorithms.

The main innovations are as follows: (1) A multi-scale feature-fusion (MFF) module is added at the end of the U-Net encoding network to improve the model's ability to extract multi-scale landslide information.

Recently, efforts have been made to use Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) for landslide monitoring. However, it is still difficult to effectively and automatically identify slow-moving landslides distributed over a large area due to phase unwrapping errors, decorrelation, troposphere turbulence and computational requirements. In this study, we develop a new approach combining phase-gradient stacking and a deep-learning network based on YOLOv3 to automatically detect slow-moving landslides from large-scale interferograms. Using Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired from 2014 to 2020, we developed a burst-based, phase-gradient stacking algorithm to sum up phase gradients in short-temporal-baseline interferograms along the azimuth and range directions. The stacked phase gradients clearly reveal the characteristics of localized surface deformation that is mainly caused by slow-moving landslides and avoids the errors due to phase unwrapping in partially decorrelated areas and atmospheric effects. Then, we trained the improved Attention-YOLOv3 network with stacked phase-gradient maps of manually labeled landslides to achieve quick and automatic detection. We applied our method in an similar to 180,000 km(2) area of southwestern China and identified 3,366 slow-moving landslides. By comparing the results with optical imagery and previously published landslides in this region, the proposed method can achieve automatic detection over a large area precisely and efficiently. From the derived landslide density map, we determined that most landslides are distributed along the three large rivers and their branches. In addition to some counties with known high-density landslides, approximately 10 more counties with high landslide density were exposed, which should attract more attention to their risks for geohazards. This application demonstrates the potential value of our newly developed method for slow-moving landslide detection over a nation-wide area, which can be employed before applying more time-consuming time-series InSAR analysis.",FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,10.3389/fenvs.2022.963322,0,0,No,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under such a background, people must accelerate the exploration of complex geological structures. This paper is aimed at using the methods and concepts of deep reinforcement learning.

Predicting the location of deforestation is challenging due to the complexity of the natural and human systems involved but accurate and timely forecasts could enable effective planning and on-the-ground enforcement practices to curb deforestation rates. New computer vision technologies based on deep learning can be applied to the increasing volume of Earth observation data to generate novel insights and make predictions with unprecedented accuracy. 2. Here, we demonstrate the ability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn spatiotemporal patterns of deforestation from a limited set of freely available global data layers, including multispectral satellite imagery, the Hansen maps of annual forest change (2001-2020) and the ALOS PALSAR digital surface model, to forecast deforestation (2021). We designed four model architectures, based on 2D CNNs, 3D CNNs, and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to produce spatial maps that indicate the risk to each forested pixel (similar to 30 m) in the landscape of becoming deforested within the next year. They were trained and tested on data from two similar to 80,000 km(2) tropical forest regions in the Southern Peruvian Amazon. 3. The networks could predict the location of future forest loss to a high degree of accuracy (F-1 = 0.58-0.71). Our best performing model (3D CNN) had the highest pixel-wise accuracy (F-1 = 0.71) when validated on 2020 forest loss (2014-2019 training). Visual interpretation of the mapped forecasts indicated that the network could automatically discern the drivers of forest loss from the input data. For example, pixels around new access routes (e.g. roads) were assigned high risk, whereas this was not the case for recent, concentrated natural loss events (e.g. remote landslides). 4. Convolutional neural networks can harness limited time-series data to predict near-future deforestation patterns, an important step in harnessing the growing volume of satellite remote sensing data to curb global deforestation. The modelling framework can be readily applied to any tropical forest location and used by governments and conservation organisations to prevent deforestation and plan protected areas.",METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1111/2041-210x.13953,0,0,No,,,England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, the geospatial dataset of 21 influencing factors was extracted from 1847 historical landslide InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) points, which were taken as a sample for the Sino-Pakistani Karakorum Highway. Secondly, Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC), random forest feature selection (RFFS), and their combinations (SCC-RFFS) were selected at different grid resolutions to identify the essential influencing factors from the 21 original factors. A random division into training set (70%) and test set (30%) was performed. Then, the LSM models for the original influencing factors and the selected influencing factors were constructed separately using machine learning models. Finally, the reasonableness of the essential influencing factors was verified by comparing the accuracy of the models under different grid resolutions. The results show that (1) relief degree of land surface (RDLS), SPI, and rainfall have significant effects on landslide occurrence. (2) The primary elements (i.e., RDLS, slop, rainfall) are less affected by the grid resolution, while the secondary elements (TWI) are more affected by the grid resolution.

This study is the first in Adama District, Ethiopia, to use deep learning (DL)-based remote sensing to assess LULCC and predict the risk of slope failures and debris flows using numerical simulation methods. This study uses DL and remote sensing to analyse the spatiotemporal changes in LULC and landslide sites. The enhanced detection of debris flow susceptibility areas enabled the precise prediction of these areas’ location and sphere of influence and the precise evaluation of debris flow risk. This led to a reduction in the losses caused by such disasters. Changes in the six classes of LULC were assessed with an overall accuracy of above 87% and an overall kappa statistic of 85%. The results revealed a decreased trend in grassland, shrubland, and bareland over 30 years (1991–2021) of − 31.03 km2, − 38.15 km2, and − 114.19 km2, respectively. Also, a recent analysis of land-use maps from the past three decades reveals that the built-up area has increased significantly, from 0.95% to 5.64%. In contrast, shrubland has decreased notably, from 12.01 to 7.78% since 2021. These changes suggest that human activity significantly impacts the landscape, and that more needs to be done to protect our natural resources.

Landslides are especially common in the mountainous areas of southwest China, where the extreme conditions make the exploration and early identification of landslides difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes a new early landslide identification method based on dynamic landslide susceptibility analysis, extracting accumulative deformation of the land over the past 5 years by SBAS-InSAR (Small Baseline Subset InSAR) technology, divided into 15 stages based on time and modeled using these 15 dynamic conditioning factors at different periods and conventional conditioning factors to get 15 landslide susceptibility maps using a machine learning algorithm. From this, the gradient change index of landslide susceptibility of each grid is calculated, and a gradient change level map of landslide susceptibility is established. In the map, the grids are divided into five susceptibility levels, i.e., very high (VH), high (H), moderate (M), low (L), and very low (VL). The VH and H levels were used for the early identification of landslide prone areas. Thirteen areas exhibiting early signs of landslides were identified, and eight were confirmed through field surveys. This procedure is of great significance as a new method that fully utilizes the change rate of susceptibility values to identify landslides. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment,10.1007/s10064-023-03440-9,0,0,No,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent geospatial practices advocated a multi-hazard analysis approach supported by artificial intelligence. This study proposes the Multi-Geoenvironmental Hazards Susceptibility (MGHS) tool, by combining Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with Machine Learning (ML) over the North-Moungo perimeter (Littoral Region, Cameroon). Methods: Twenty-four factors were constructed from satellite imagery, global geodatabase and fieldwork data. Multicollinearity among these factors was quantified using the tolerance coefficient (TOL) and variance inflation factor (VIF). The AHP coefficients were used to weigh the factors and produce a preliminary map per Geoenvironmental hazard through weighted linear combination (WLC). The sampling was conducted based on events records and analyst knowledge to proceed with classification using Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing interface. Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), were used as basic learners of the stacked hazard factors, whereas, Support Vector Regression (SVR), was used for a meta-learning. Results: The rainfall was ranked as the highest triggering factor for all Geoenvironmental hazards according to AHP, with a coefficient of 1, while the after-learning importance assessment was more varied. The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC/AUC) was always more than 0.96, and F1-score is between [0.86–0.88] for basic classifiers. Landslides, gully erosion and flash floods showed different spatial distributions, confirming then their probability of co-occurrence. MGHS outputs clearly displayed two and three simultaneous occurrences. Finally, the human vulnerability assessed with population layer and SVR outputs showed that high human concentrations are also the most exposed, using the example of Nkongsamba’s extract. Conclusions: Combining AHP with single learners, then a meta-learner, was efficient in modelling MGHS and related human vulnerability. Interactions among geo-environmental hazards are the next step and city councils are recommended to integrate results in the planning process. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Geoenvironmental Disasters,10.1186/s40677-023-00254-5,0,0,Yes,,,"United States,Cameroon,France,United Kingdom,Senegal,Algeria,Morocco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This hinders predictive efforts, leading to significant impacts on human life and economies. Multi-hazard prediction is vital for any natural hazard risk management plan. The main objective of this study was the development of a multi-hazard susceptibility mapping framework, by combining two natural hazards—flooding and landslides—in the North Central region of Vietnam. This was accomplished using support vector machines, random forest, and AdaBoost. The input data consisted of 4591 flood points, 1315 landslide points, and 13 conditioning factors, split into training (70%), and testing (30%) datasets. The accuracy of the models' predictions was evaluated using the statistical indices root mean square error, area under curve (AUC), mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. All proposed models were good at predicting multi-hazard susceptibility, with AUC values over 0.95. Among them, the AUC value for the support vector machine model was 0.98 and 0.99 for landslide and flood, respectively. For the random forest model, these values were 0.98 and 0.98, and for AdaBoost, they were 0.99 and 0.99. The multi-hazard maps were built by combining the landslide and flood susceptibility maps. The results showed that approximately 60% of the study area was affected by landslides, 30% by flood, and 8% by both hazards. These results illustrate how North Central is one of the regions of Vietnam that is most severely affected by natural hazards, particularly flooding, and landslides. The proposed models adapt to evaluate multi-hazard susceptibility at different scales, although expert intervention is also required, to optimize the algorithms. Multi-hazard maps can provide a valuable point of reference for decision makers in sustainable land-use planning and infrastructure development in regions faced with multiple hazards, and to prevent and reduce more effectively the frequency of floods and landslides and their damage to human life and property. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Transactions in GIS,10.1111/tgis.13091,0,0,Yes,,,"Viet Nam,Romania,Moldova",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The modeling process is relatively complicated and multi-models cannot be integrated. With regard to this issue, this study develops a Python system for automatic assessment of regional landslide susceptibility. The Python system implements landslide susceptibility assessment through three modules: geographic data processing, machine learning modeling and result evaluation analysis. For geographic data processing, ten landslide influencing factors can be used to construct an evaluation factor dataset and reclassify the thematic maps based on the frequency ratio method. Four built-in machine learning models (logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) are integrated into the system to complete susceptibility modeling and calculation. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves can be automatically generated to evaluate the accuracy. The system was then applied into Lantian County in Shaanxi Province as a demonstration example. The results show that the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of the four models are 0.838 (LR)、0.882 (SVM)、0.809 (MLP) and 0.812 (XGBoost), respectively, indicating that the SVM model was the most suitable model for landslide susceptibility assessment in Lantian County in the Loess Plateau of China.

The results demonstrate that machine learning techniques using principal components (especially, artificial neural network and support vector machine) yield better results compared to other models. In particular, random forest shows poor results. Artificial neural network and support vector machine approaches are compared to the results of physical-based methods in the same area, suggesting that machine learning methods can provide better results for developing co-seismic landslide susceptibility maps. The application of different advanced statistical models shows the need for validation with an actual inventory of co-seismic landslides to ensure reliability and objectivity.

Their number, however, lies at the lower limit for reliable statistical analyses. By selecting a statistical sample in an area with rather homogeneous conditions (thereby reducing the number of meaningful covariates), significant insights can nevertheless be obtained. We relied on an inventory of 145 landslides which discerns between types of movement and implemented six machine learning algorithms (Decorate, DE-REPTree, Random Subspace, RS-REPTree, Dagging, and DA-REPTree) to produce landslide susceptibility maps. This allowed us to evaluate the relative importance and the effect of covariates in the models and identify factors that are consistently associated with the presence of landslides. Our results demonstrate that, even for a small landslide inventory, reliable susceptibility maps can be produced for homogeneous landscapes. We discuss that our approach could be used to assess the reliability of statistical approaches at small scales, where a distinctive trigger is lacking. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment,10.1007/s10064-023-03328-8,0,0,Yes,,,"China,Iran,Czech Republic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A geographic information system (GIS) has generally been accepted in the correlation analysis between linear hazard-causing factors and landslides; the most common are statistical models based on buffer zone analysis and superposition analysis for linear causative factor distances and landslide counts. However, there is a problem in the process of model building: the buffer distance that is used to build the statistical model and its statistical results can appropriately reflect the correlation between the linear disaster-causing factors and landslides. To solve this problem, a statistical model of landslide density and distance of linear disaster-causing factors under different single-loop buffer distances was established based on Pearson’s method with 12 environmental factors, such as elevation, topographic relief, and distance from the water system and road, in Ruijin City, Jiangxi Province to obtain the most relevant single-loop buffer distance linear disaster-causing factor combinations; random forest (RF) machine learning models were then used to predict landslide susceptibility. Finally, the Kappa coefficient and the distribution characteristics of the susceptibility index were used to investigate the modeling laws. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the most correlated single-loop buffer distance combination reaches 96.65%, the error rate of non-landslide points is 4.2%, and the error of landslide points is 11.3%, which is higher than the same single-loop buffer distance combination, confirming the reasonableness of the method of using correlation to obtain the linear disaster-causing factor buffer distance. © 2023 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su151310180,0,0,Yes,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To properly plan and manage these regions, it is crucial to accurately identify areas susceptible to landslides. In this study, we developed and applied novel hybrid machine learning models, RF-FPA and MAB-FPA, which combine forest by penalizing attribute (FPA), with two ensemble techniques, random forest (RF) and multiboost (MAB), to construct landslide susceptibility maps of Dien Bien province in Vietnam. For the development of hybrid models, we have used data of 665 landslide events and 12 landslide conditioning factors namely distance to rivers, elevations, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index, faults, curvature, slope, flow accumulation, stream power index, geology, topographic wetness index (TWI), and aspect. Standard statistical measures including area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve were used to evaluate predictive performance of the developed models. Results showed that both proposed novel hybrid models performed well in the correct identification of landslide susceptible areas, with RF-FPA (AUC = 0.840) slightly outperforming MAB-FPA (AUC = 0.814). The performance of the proposed hybrid models was also significantly better than that of single base classifier FPA (AUC = 0.807). In conclusion, while all the studied models performed well, the novel RF-FPA model is a more promissing tool for accurate mapping and correct prediction of landslide susceptibile areas compared to MAB-FPA amd FPA models.

Given the necessity of assessing the current seismic conditions for ensuring the safety of life and infrastructure, there is a rising demand worldwide to recognize the extent of landslides and map their susceptibility. This study involved two stages: First, the regions prone to earthquake-induced landslides were detected, and the data were used to train deep learning (DL) models and generate landslide susceptibility maps. The application of DL models was expected to improve the outcomes in both stages. Landslide inventory was extracted from Sentinel-2 data by using U-Net, VGG-16, and VGG-19 algorithms. Because VGG-16 produced the most accurate inventory locations, the corresponding results were used in the landslide susceptibility detection stage. In the second stage, landslide susceptibility maps were generated. From the total measured landslide locations (63,360 cells), 70% of the locations were used for training the DL models (i.e., convolutional neural network [CNN], CNN-imperialist competitive algorithm, and CNN-gray wolf optimizer [GWO]), and the remaining 30% were used for validation. The earthquake-induced landslide conditioning factors included the elevation, slope, plan curvature, valley depth, topographic wetness index, land cover, rainfall, distance to rivers, and distance to roads. The reliability of the generated susceptibility maps was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and root mean square error (RMSE). The CNN-GWO model (AUROC = 0.84 and RMSE = 0.284) outperformed the other methods and can thus be used in similar applications. The results demonstrated the efficiency of applying DL in the natural hazard domain. The CNN-GWO predicted that approximately 38% of the total area consisted of high and very high susceptibility regions, mainly concentrated in areas with steep slopes and high levels of rainfall and soil wetness.

Despite developing numerous deep learning models for landslide detection, a lightweight framework for embedding landslide detection in mobile devices or hardware is yet to be devised. This paper proposes a lightweight deep learning model for pixel-based landslide detection called Separable Factorized Convolution Network (SFCNet). The proposed SFCNet's efficiency is observed in the study area, located on the eastern side of the Western Ghats in the Kodagu district, India, which is known for its landslide endeavor. SFCNet is a lightweight convolutional network that incorporates separable and factorized convolution. The separable convolution and factorized convolution are employed in the proposed SFCNet to lower the number of parameters and the computational complexity. In addition, the SFCNet's performance is examined under various scaling and folding instances. The results prove that the proposed SFCNet minimizes the number of parameters by over 95% compared to the existing deep CNN model. The proposed SFCNet's F1 score and accuracy on landslide detection are 98.34 and 98.36%, respectively. The susceptibility map of landslides for the study area is mapped from the probability of prediction of landslides by the SFCNet. From the SFCNet's performance on landslide detection and mapping, it is observed that it has significant scope for various applications in large area landslide identification. Therefore, it can be suggested for risk analysis and emergency rescue. © 2023, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing,10.1007/s12524-023-01685-1,0,0,Yes,,,"India,China,Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prediction of this phenomenon is of great interest; however, it is a complex task in which traditional methods have limitations. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a successful alternative in the geological field. Most of the related works use classical machine learning algorithms to correlate the variables of the phenomenon and its occurrence. This requires large quantitative landslide datasets, collected and labeled manually, which is costly in terms of time and effort. In this work, we create an image dataset using an official landslide inventory, which we verified and updated based on journalistic information and interpretation of satellite images of the study area. The images cover the landslide crowns and the actual triggering values of the conditioning factors at the detail level (5 × 5 pixels). Our approach focuses on the specific location where the landslide starts and its proximity, unlike other works that consider the entire landslide area as the occurrence of the phenomenon. These images correspond to geological, geomorphological, hydrological and anthropological variables, which are stacked in a similar way to the channels of a conventional image to feed and train a convolutional neural network. Therefore, we improve the quality of the data and the representation of the phenomenon to obtain a more robust, reliable and accurate prediction model. The results indicate an average accuracy of 97.48%, which allows the generation of a landslide susceptibility map on the Aloag-Santo Domingo highway in Ecuador.

A novel method based on deep learning model for national-scale landslide hazard assessment was proposed in this study, which contains three stages: (1) landslide susceptibility analysis using three hybrid neural networks of convolutional neural network-simple recurrent unit (CNN-SRU), convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), and convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU); (2) landslide temporal probability prediction using the proposed spatiotemporal transformer (ST-transformer) to address the time uncertainty of rainfall threshold calculation in landslide temporal probability prediction and the matter without considering the geographical regional differences of landslide spatiotemporal probability weights; and (3) quantitative landslide hazard calculation with the preceding results using the improved landslide hazard formula.

The complexity is not only influenced by specific model frameworks but also by the type and complexity of the modeling data. Therefore, considering the impact of factor data types on the model’s decision-making mechanism holds significant importance in assessing regional landslide characteristics and conducting landslide risk warnings given the achievement of good predictive performance for landslide susceptibility using excellent ML methods. The decision-making mechanism of landslide susceptibility models coupled with different types of factor data in machine learning methods was explained in this study by utilizing the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. Furthermore, a comparative analysis was carried out to examine the differential effects of diverse data types for identical factors on model predictions. The study area selected was Cenxi, Guangxi, where a geographic spatial database was constructed by combining 23 landslide conditioning factors with 214 landslide samples from the region. Initially, the factors were standardized using five conditional probability models, frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV), certainty factor (CF), evidential belief function (EBF), and weights of evidence (WOE), based on the spatial arrangement of landslides. This led to the formation of six types of factor databases using the initial data. Subsequently, two ensemble-based ML methods, random forest (RF) and XGBoost, were utilized to build models for predicting landslide susceptibility. Various evaluation metrics were employed to compare the predictive capabilities of different models and determined the optimal model. Simultaneously, the analysis was conducted using the interpretable SHAP method for intrinsic decision-making mechanisms of different ensemble-based ML models, with a specific focus on explaining and comparing the differential impacts of different types of factor data on prediction results. The results of the study illustrated that the XGBoost-CF model constructed with CF values of factors not only exhibited the best predictive accuracy and stability but also yielded more reasonable results for landslide susceptibility zoning, and was thus identified as the optimal model. The global interpretation results revealed that slope was the most crucial factor influencing landslides, and its interaction with other factors in the study area collectively contributed to landslide occurrences. The differences in the internal decision-making mechanisms of models based on different data types for the same factors primarily manifested in the extent of influence on prediction results and the dependency of factors, providing an explanation for the performance of standardized data in ML models and the reasons behind the higher predictive performance of coupled models based on conditional probability models and ML methods. Through comprehensive analysis of the local interpretation results from different models analyzing the same sample with different sample characteristics, the reasons for model prediction errors can be summarized, thereby providing a reference framework for constructing more accurate and rational landslide susceptibility models and facilitating landslide warning and management. © 2023 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su151813563,0,0,Yes,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional sample production methods utilize statistical methods for quantification of dependent variables, and statistical formulas lead to a loss of information on the precise locations of landslides. This leads to uncertainty in the final prediction results. In this work, a new form of pixel-level sample production is proposed to preserve the landslide's boundary location information as much as possible. Three machine learning models, namely, a logistic regression model, a deep neural network model, and a transformer model, are combined with the sample production method proposed in this paper. The accuracy was verified using receiver operating characteristic curves. The three models' areas under the curves were 0.935, 0.963, and 0.980, respectively.

Limited by labor cost and observation technology, landslide samples are extremely limited in dense vegetation-covered and remote areas, making the common supervised learning model underfit with limited samples. Therefore, the reliability of analysis results in mountainous areas is low. Transfer learning can achieve reliable assessment without the need for representative samples. However, transfer learning suffers from environmental heterogeneity in regional LSE and may transfer incorrect classification knowledge of landslide features from dissimilar environments. Aiming at these challenges, we proposed a geo-environment-aware LSE method based on unsupervised adversarial transfer learning. The key is to consider the difference in landslide features in different geo-environments. The study areas were first divided into multiple sub-environments, and the similarity between the sub-environments was calculated. Then an environment-aware adversarial transfer model was built for fine-grained aligning of the landslide feature with similar sub-environments and for reducing negative transfer between dissimilar environments. The fitted classification model was employed to predict the target regions and to generate the final LSE. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method achieves reliable LSE for sample-free regions. The accuracy of the proposed method is 7–12% better than commonly used methods such as support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks. The performance of the proposed method is even close to the results of supervised learning with the presence of representative samples, and it also performs more globally and objectively in susceptibility mapping. These results reveal that the proposed method effectively transfers the knowledge of landslide susceptibility from other regions to the sample-free region. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Transactions in GIS,10.1111/tgis.13080,0,0,Yes,,,"China,Hong Kong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study implements a dynamic approach to landslide hazard mapping by integrating spatio-temporal probability analysis with time-varying ground deformation velocity derived from the MT-InSAR (Multi-Temporal InSAR) method. Reliable landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) can inform landslide risk managers and government officials. First, sixteen factors were selected to construct a causal factor system for LSM. Next, Pearson correlation analysis, multicollinearity analysis, information gain ratio, and GeoDetector methods were applied to remove the least important factors of STI, plan curvature, TRI, and slope length. Subsequently, information quantity (IQ), logistic regression (LR), frequency ratio (FR), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods were performed to construct the LSM. The results showed that the distance to a river, slope angle, distance from structure, and engineering geological rock group were the main factors controlling landslide development. A comprehensive set of statistical indicators was employed to evaluate these methods’ effectiveness; sensitivity, F1-measure, and AUC (area under the curve) were calculated and subsequently compared to assess the performance of the methods. Machine learning methods’ training and prediction accuracy were higher than those of statistical methods. The AUC values of the IQ, FR, LR, BP-ANN, RBF-ANN, RF, SVM, and CNN methods were 0.810, 0.854, 0.828, 0.895, 0.916, 0.932, 0.948, and 0.957, respectively. Although the performance order varied for other statistical indicators, overall, the CNN method was the best, while the BP-ANN and RBF-ANN method was the worst among the five examined machine methods. Hence, adopting the CNN approach in this study can enhance LSM accuracy, catering to the needs of planners and government agencies responsible for managing landslide-prone areas and preventing landslide-induced disasters. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15215256,0,0,No,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The traditional research of landslide disaster based on experience-driven or statistical model and its assessment results are subjective, difficult to quantify, and no pertinence. As a new research method for landslide susceptibility assessment, machine learning can greatly improve the landslide susceptibility model's accuracy by constructing statistical models. Taking Western Henan for example, the study selected 16 landslide influencing factors such as topography, geological environment, hydrological conditions, and human activities, and 11 landslide factors with the most significant influence on the landslide were selected by the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. Five machine learning methods [Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)] were used to construct the spatial distribution model of landslide susceptibility. The models were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve and statistical index. After analysis and comparison, the XGBoost model (AUC 0.8759) performed the best and was suitable for dealing with regression problems. The model had a high adaptability to landslide data. According to the landslide susceptibility map of the five models, the overall distribution can be observed. The extremely high and high susceptibility areas are distributed in the Funiu Mountain range in the southwest, the Xiaoshan Mountain range in the west, and the Yellow River Basin in the north. These areas have large terrain fluctuations, complicated geological structural environments and frequent human engineering activities.

Effective simulation of these events requires a solver for shallow water equations (SWEs). Traditional numerical methods, such as finite difference and finite volume, face challenges in discretizing convection flux terms, while theory-based models need to account for various factors such as shock wave capturing and wave propagation direction, demanding a high-level understanding of the underlying physics. Previous deep learning (DL)-based SWE solvers primarily focused on constructing direct input–output mappings, leading to weak generalization properties when terrain data or stress constitutive relations change. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel SWE solver that combines theory and data-driven methodologies. The core idea is to use artificial neural networks to compute convection flux terms, and to reduce modeling complexity. Theory-based modeling is used to tackle complex terrain and friction terms for the purpose of ensuring generalization. Our method surpasses challenges faced by previous DL-based solvers in capturing terrain and stress variations. We validated our solver’s capabilities by comparing simulation results with analytical solutions, real-world disaster cases, and the widely used Massflow software-generated simulations. This comprehensive comparison confirms our solver’s ability to accurately simulate hazard scenarios and showcases strong generalization on varying terrain and land surface friction. Our proposed method effectively addresses DL-based solver limitations while simplifying the complexities of theory-driven numerical methods, offering a promising approach for hazard dynamics simulation. © 2023 by the authors.",Water (Switzerland),10.3390/w15173140,0,0,No,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The quality of the landslide susceptibility maps was evaluated using several metrics, including the mean landslide susceptibility index (LSI), modelling uncertainty, and predictive accuracy. The results demonstrate that both models effectively capture the actual distribution of landslides, with areas exhibiting high LSI predominantly concentrated on both sides of the seismogenic fault. The RF model exhibits less sensitivity to changes in training samples, whereas the LR model displays significant variation in LSI with sample changes. Overall, both models demonstrate satisfactory performance; however, the RF model exhibits superior predictive capability compared to the LR model. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15194733,0,0,Yes,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper focuses on Pengyang County, which is situated in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of China, an area prone to landslides. This study investigated the application of machine learning techniques for analyzing landslide susceptibility. To construct and validate the model, we initially compiled a landslide inventory comprising 972 historical landslides and an equivalent number of non-landslide sites (Data sourced from the Pengyang County Department of Natural Resources). To ensure an impartial evaluation, both the landslide and non-landslide datasets were randomly divided into two sets using a 70/30 ratio. Next, we extracted 15 landslide conditioning factors, including the slope angle, elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, TWI (topographic wetness index), TPI (topographic position index), distance to roads and rivers, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), rainfall, land use, lithology, SPI (stream power index), and STI (sediment transport index), from the spatial database. Subsequently, a correlation analysis between the conditioning factors and landslide occurrences was conducted using the certainty factor (CF) method. Three landslide models were established by employing logistic regression (LR), functional trees (FTs), and random subspace functional trees (RSFTs) algorithms. The landslide susceptibility map was categorized into five levels: very low, low, medium, high, and very high susceptibility. Finally, the predictive capability of the three algorithms was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The better the prediction, the higher the AUC value. The results indicate that all three models are predictive and practical, with only minor discrepancies in accuracy. The integrated model (RSFT) displayed the highest predictive performance, achieving an AUC value of 0.844 for the training dataset and 0.837 for the validation dataset. This was followed by the LR model (0.811 for the training dataset and 0.814 for the validation dataset) and the FT model (0.776 for the training dataset and 0.760 for the validation dataset). The proposed methods and resulting landslide susceptibility map can assist researchers and local authorities in making informed decisions for future geohazard prevention and mitigation. Furthermore, they will prove valuable and be useful for other regions with similar geological characteristics features. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15204952,0,0,Yes,,,"China,Greece",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a novel ensemble broad learning system (BLS) was proposed for evaluating landslide susceptibility in Taiyuan City, Northern China. Meanwhile, ensemble learning models based on the classification and regression tree (CART) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were applied for a comparison with the BLS-AdaBoost model. Firstly, in this study, a grand total of 114 landslide locations were identified, which were randomly divided into two parts, namely 70% for model training and the remaining 30% for model validation. Twelve landslide conditioning factors were selected for mapping landslide susceptibility. Subsequently, three models, namely CART-AdaBoost, SVM-AdaBoost and BLS-AdaBoost, were constructed and used to map landslide susceptibility. The frequency ratio (FR) was used to assess the relationship between landslides and different influencing factors. Finally, the three models were validated and compared on the basis of both statistical-based evaluations and ROC curve-based evaluations. The results showed that the integrated model with BLS as the base learner achieved the highest AUC value of 0.889, followed by the integrated models that used CART (AUC = 0.873) and SVM (AUC = 0.846) as the base learners. In general, the BLS-based integrated learning methods are effective for evaluating landslide susceptibility. Currently, the application of BLS and the integrated BLS model for evaluating landslide susceptibility is limited.

It is a technical problem to identify landslides from satellite remote sensing images. Although there are some methods at present, there is still room for improvement in the target detection algorithm of landslides against the background of the diversity and complexity of landslides. In this paper, target detection algorithm models such as Faster R-CNN apply to landslide recognition and detection tasks, and various commonly used recognition and detection algorithm network structures are used as the basic models for landslide recognition. Efficient residual channel soft thresholding attention mechanism algorithm (ERCA) is proposed, which intends to reduce the background noise of images in complex environments by means of deep learning adaptive soft thresholding to improve the feature learning capability of deep learning target detection algorithms. ERCA is added to the backbone network of the target detection algorithm for basic feature extraction to enhance the feature extraction and expression capability of the network. During the experiment ERCA combined with ResNet50, ResNet101 and other backbone networks, the objective indicators of detection results such as AP50 (Average Precision at IOU=0.50), AP75 (Average Precision at IOU=0.75) and AP (Average Precision) were improved, and the AP values were all improved to about 4%, and the final detection results using ResNet101 combined with ERCA as the backbone network reached 76.4% AP value. ERCA and other advanced channel attention networks such as ECA (Efficient Channel Attention for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks) and SENet (Squeezeand-Excitation Networks) are fused into the backbone network of the target detection algorithm and experimented on the landslide identification detection task, and the detection results are that the objective detection indexes AP50, AP75, AP, etc. are higher for ERCA compared with other channel attention, and the subjective detection image detection effect and feature map visualization display are also better. © 2023, ComSIS Consortium.

Active learning is an artificial intelligence strategy that can achieve good performances in landslide mapping by training a machine-learning model with a reduced number of landslide/non-landslide observations, which can save time and effort in labeling training instances. Nevertheless, active-learning models are unstable at the beginning of sample selection due to the limited initial knowledge of landslide distribution. Transfer learning can help make the learner robust by transferring a landslide model trained on an existing landslide inventory from a different, but geographically similar source area, to the unseen target area. In order to adjust a transferred machine-learning model to the possibly unique environmental characteristics of the unseen area, we proposed a new framework called Unsupervised Active-Transfer Learning (UATL). This framework used a weight function to combine the landslide model transferred from the source area, with a model trained on a small, but increasing number of landslide/non-landslide observations from the target area to efficiently build a more robust learner. We examined two methods, adaptive UATL and regular UATL, which differed in the way they assign weights to the combined learners. We evaluated our proposed new methods by comparing them with three benchmark methods (active learning only, model transfer only, and the model trained in the unseen area itself) by means of the partial area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC) as the evaluation criterion. The results showed that the new methods, and especially adaptive UATL, can achieve good predictive performances. With only about 235 training instances from the target area, the partial AUROC obtained from adaptive UATL was only 2% lower than that obtained from the model trained in the target area itself, and consistently outperformed the other two benchmarks. Overall, we suggest that the framework proposed can be applied to the natural hazards management workflow for assisting in emergency response, especially in data-scarce regions (e.g., mountainous areas and developing countries). © 2023 The Authors",Computers and Geosciences,10.1016/j.cageo.2023.105457,0,0,No,,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conducting a comprehensive regional-scale susceptibility assessment is crucial for mitigating the potential risks associated with submarine landslides in gas hydrate enrichment regions. This study conducted a preliminary exploration by presenting a probabilistic assessment framework that integrated database construction, rapid prediction model training, and landslide susceptibility assessment in hydrate enrichment regions. The database was a virtual repository constructed using numerical simulations of hydrate dissociation under various combinations of factors, including water depth, geothermal gradients, seafloor slope gradients, the seafloor temperature’s rate of increase, gas hydrate saturation, and the strength and permeability of sediments. The rapid prediction model was trained using machine learning techniques, relying on the virtual database. A probabilistic assessment was performed using Monte Carlo simulations, with the landslide susceptibility determined by the rapid prediction model. The probability of landslide susceptibility exceeding a certain threshold served as an indicator for classifying the susceptibility of the study area. The proposed framework was implemented in the Shenhu area of the South China Sea, which is a representative region known for its substantial hydrate enrichment and well-developed landslides. The trained rapid prediction model for landslide susceptibility exhibited a speed advantage of over 60,000 times compared to traditional numerical calculation methods. The statistical analysis of the results in Monte Carlo simulations suggested that the landslide susceptibility was subjected to a high level of uncertainty due to limited survey data availability. Based on the probability of landslide susceptibility exceeding 0.4 in Monte Carlo simulations, the study area was classified into three zones of susceptibility: low, moderate, and high levels. © 2023 by the authors.",Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,10.3390/jmse11071366,0,0,No,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research investigates the hazards of landslides and floods in two adopted basins in the Yamaguchi and Shimane prefectures, Japan. This study utilized ten environmental variables alongside categories representing landslide-prone, non-landslide, flooded, and non-flooded areas. Employing a machine-learning approach, namely, a LASSO regression model, we generated Landslide Hazard Maps (LHM), Flood Hazard Maps (FHM), and a Composite Hazard Map (CHM). The LHM identified flood-prone low-lying areas in the northwest and southeast, while central and northwest regions exhibited higher landslide susceptibility. Both LHM and FHM were classified into five hazard levels. Landslide hazards predominantly covered high- to moderate-risk areas, since the high-risk areas constituted 38.8% of the study region. Conversely, flood hazards were mostly low to moderate, with high- and very high-risk areas at 10.49% of the entire study area. The integration of LHM and FHM into CHM emphasized high-risk regions, underscoring the importance of tailored mitigation strategies. The accuracy of the model was assessed by employing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve method, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were determined. The LHM and FHM exhibited an exceptional AUC of 99.36% and 99.06%, respectively, signifying the robust efficacy of the model.

This study involved preparing a landslide inventory, analyzing landslide causative factors, and developing landslide susceptibility models (LSMs) using published data, remote sensing interpretations, field excursions and integrated predictive techniques. We first used Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC), variable importance factors (VIF), and information gain ratio (IGR) to evaluate multicollinearity among the selected landslide causative factors (LCFs). Then, the topographic roughness index (TRI) with VIF > 5 and PCC > 0.7 was considered a redundant factor and thus removed before the data modeling. Finally, we adopted multiple machine-learning methods to analyze landslide susceptibility. The results indicate that the landslide inventory contains 1,776 events, of which 674 were classified based on geometrical and lithological configurations. The IGR results show that the rainfall, lithology, PGA, drainage density, slope, and distance to fault are the most effective LCFs.

Forty-eight of the identified geological hazards are not recorded in the Beijing geological hazards list. The most effective model in the study area was RF. The percentage of geological hazard susceptibility zoning in the study area is as follows: very low susceptibility 27.40%, low susceptibility 28.06%, moderate susceptibility 21.19%, high susceptibility 13.80%, very high susceptibility 9.57%. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15225316,0,0,Yes,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, there have been vast applications of data-driven LSA methods owing to the increased availability of high-quality satellite data and landslide inventories. However, two issues remain to be addressed, as follows: (a) Items in a landslide inventory are mainly historical landslides from the interpretation of optical images and site investigation, resulting in predictive models trained with these items being insensitive to undetectable slope movements, such as slow-moving landslides that have not yet occurred; (b) Most study areas contain a variety of landslide-prone geographical settings that a single model can not accommodate well. Considering the complex landslide causes in Hong Kong with a land area of approximately 1108 km2, we proposed the utilization of multi-temporal InSAR techniques to generate weak landslide samples from slopes with ground surface movements for landslide inventory augmentation; and meta-learn intermediate representations for the fast adaptation of LSA models corresponding to different landslide-prone geographical settings. Besides, we performed feature permutation to identify dominant landslide-predisposing factors. The LSA results in Hong Kong revealed that slope deformation in several mountainous areas is closely associated with the occurrence of recorded landslides. By augmenting the landslide inventory using InSAR techniques, the proposed method enhanced the LSA models' capacity to identify slow-moving landslides and achieved better statistical performance. The discussion highlights that slope and stream power index (SPI) are the key landslide-predisposing factors in Hong Kong, but the dominant landslide-predisposing factors will vary under different geographical conditions. By comparison with the methods that treat LSA as a binary classification problem, such as support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, deep belief network, and random forest based LSA methods, the proposed method entails a fast-learning strategy and outperforms these methods in data-driven model evaluation indicators, e.g., by 3–6% in accuracy, 2–6% in precision, 1–2% in recall, 3–5% in F1-score, and approximately 10% in Cohen Kappa. The information about the relative importance of landslide predisposing factors, derived through feature permutation, can foster guidance for targeted landslide prevention schemes, such as constructing and maintaining slope consolidation facilities in areas where slope is the dominant landslide-predisposing factor. © 2023",Engineering Geology,10.1016/j.enggeo.2023.107342,0,0,Yes,,,"China,Hong Kong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies that have focused on modeling earthquake-triggered landslides report high prediction accuracies. However, it is common to use a validation strategy with an equal number of landslide and non-landslide samples, scattered homogeneously across the study area. Consequently, there are overestimations in the epicenter area, and the spatial pattern of modeled locations does not agree well with real events. In order to improve landslide hazard mapping, we proposed a spatially heterogeneous non-landslide sampling strategy by considering local ratios of landslide to non-landslide area. Coseismic landslides triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake on the eastern Tibetan Plateau were used as an example. To assess the performance of the new strategy, we trained two random forest models that shared the same hyperparameters. The first was trained using samples from the new heterogeneous strategy, and the second used the traditional approach. In each case the spatial match between modeled and measured (interpreted) landslides was examined by scatterplot, with a 2 km-by-2 km fishnet. Although the traditional approach achieved higher AUCROC (0.95) accuracy than the proposed one (0.85), the coefficient of determination (R2) for the new strategy (0.88) was much higher than for the traditional strategy (0.55). Our results indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms the traditional one when comparing against landslide inventory data. Our work demonstrates that higher prediction accuracies in landslide hazard modeling may be deceptive, and validation of the modeled spatial pattern should be prioritized. The proposed method may also be used to improve the mapping of precipitation-induced landslides. Application of the proposed strategy could benefit precise assessment of landslide risks in mountain environments. © 2023, The Author(s).",International Journal of Disaster Risk Science,10.1007/s13753-023-00489-8,0,0,No,,,"China,United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve this, the database was randomly divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. We considered the impact of soil thickness, which has rarely been explored in previous research. A spatial database of 19 conditioning factors related to the occurrence of a landslide was constructed to develop the landslide susceptibility maps. Thereafter, three models were estimated and compared using metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results show that the random forest model with the testing dataset has higher accuracy (0.848), F1 score (0.740) and AUC (0.904) values.

For this research, the study area selected was Hokkaido, Japan, which experienced a total of 5,625 landslides as a single event caused by the 2018 Ibury earthquake. The objective of this study is to address the class imbalance issue and improve the accuracy of LSA. Multiple data sources are utilized to obtain conditioning factors, and objective absence data sampling based on Mahalanobis distance is employed to tackle the unlabeled sample problem. The RF model is used to calculate landslide susceptibility values and generate LSA. These values are then evaluated using two diagnostic tools, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Precision-Recall curve (AUPRC).

However, due to the lack of explanations of the influence of input contributing factors by current DL models, accurately identifying the cause of each landslide remains challenging. This study proposes a novel interpretable DL model named Deep-Attention-LSF, which assigns significance scores to contributing factors at local levels for attributing landslide susceptibility. This model considers the significance scores of input factors to more accurately predict landslide occurrence. DeepLIFT is used as an attribution branching network for interpreting the relationship between input factors and each landslide event. Subsequently, a landslide classification network formed by combining convolutional neural network and long short-term memory is used to predict the landslide occurrence in the entire study area. The performance of Deep-Attention-LSF is tested using the landslide inventory map of Three Gorges Reservoir Area and the associated maps of 18 landslide-related factors. The accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score of our model were 0.9645, 0.9583, 0.9676, and 0.9522, respectively. These suggest that our model outperformed the compared models, including self-attention LSM, frequency-ratio-attention LSM, bagging and random subspace naive Bayes tree, gradient boosting decision tree, random forest, information value model, and enhanced C5.0 decision tree model. Deep-Attention-LSF provided reasonable explanations for landslide attributions by comparison with field investigation reports for four specific landslide cases. Combining the interpretation of Deep-Attention-LSF with field investigations can provide more comprehensive information for evaluating specific landslides, providing a useful tool for landslide prevention and management. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,10.1109/tgrs.2023.3323668,0,0,Yes,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposed a novel strategy, namely transfer learning with attributes (TLAs), to make good use of existing landslide inventory data, a strategy that is based on a variational autoencoder of a generative adversarial network (VAEGAN) for improving the landslide spatial prediction performance in sample-scarce areas. Different from transfer learning (TL), TLAs are pretraining the model with the data reconstructed by VAEGAN, so that the models learn in advance the landslide attributes of sample-scarce areas.

The experimental results showed that the TLA strategy increased the mean value of evaluators, such as the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC), F1-score, precision, recall and accuracy by about 2–7% compared with TL, results that indicated that the generated data have the attribute of specific study areas and the effectiveness of TLA strategy in sample-scare areas. © 2023 by the authors.",Land,10.3390/land12030525,0,0,Yes,,,"China,France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two typical karst erosion landforms were selected as the research areas. Based on 15 conditioning factors, LSMs for the two areas were developed using the Bayesian optimization random forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The SHAP model was used to explore the landslide formation mechanisms from both global and local perspectives. The results show that the area under the curve (AUC) values of the XGBoost models were 0.791 and 0.761, and the AUC values of the RF models were 0.844 and 0.817, in the two different landform areas, respectively. The RF model's accuracy was higher than that of the XGBoost model in both regions. In the low-elevation hills area, the primary three conditioning factors were identified as slope, topographic relief and distance from the river. Conversely, in the microrelief and mesorelief low mountain area, the predominant conditioning factors were elevation, distance from the river and distance from the road. Both karst landform areas exhibited a high sensitivity to the distance from the river, indicating its significant interaction with other factors contributing to landslide occurrences. Notably, the RF model demonstrated superior performance compared to the XGBoost model, rendering it a more suitable choice for conducting landslide susceptibility mapping research in karst erosion landform areas. In the present study, a comprehensive explanatory framework based on the RF-SHAP model was proposed, which enables both global and local interpretation of landslides in various karst landscapes.

However, the complexity of classically trained ML is often beyond nonexperts. With the rapid growth of practical applications, an “off-the-shelf” ML technique that can be easily used by nonexperts is highly relevant. In the present study, a new paradigm for an end-to-end ML modeling was adopted for LSM in the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA) using automated machine learning (AutoML) as the backend model support for the paradigm. A well-defined database consisting of data from 290 landslides and 11 conditioning factors was collected for implementing AutoML and compared with classically trained ML approaches. The stacked ensemble model from AutoML achieved the best performance (0.954), surpassing the support vector machine with artificial bee colony optimization (ABC-SVM, 0.931), gray wolf optimization (GWO-SVM, 0.925), particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM, 0.925), water cycle algorithm (WCA-SVM, 0.925), grid search (GS-SVM, 0.920), multilayer perceptron (MLP, 0.908), classification and regression tree (CART, 0.891), K-nearest neighbor (KNN, 0.898), and random forest (RF, 0.909) in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Notable improvements of up to 11% in AUC demonstrate that the AutoML approach succeeded in LSM and could be used to select the best model with minimal effort or intervention from the user. Moreover, a simple model that has been customarily ignored by practitioners and researchers has been identified with performance satisfying practical requirements.

Nevertheless, its distinct and intricate geographical characteristics make it susceptible to recurrent landslides. As an essential tool, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is significant in managing and alleviating landslides near the KKH. Moreover, landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) are crucial determinants influencing the outcomes of LSM. However, existing methods primarily rely on machine learning algorithms, which do not adequately account for the intricate spatial characteristics and patterns between LCFs and landslide occurrences. In response, this study introduces the feature fusion transformer (FFTR) module, constructed based on the foundations of the transformer framework, to fuse the spatial information features of all LCFs. Subsequently, the abstract high-level spatial features obtained are fed into diverse machine learning classifiers, including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), categorical boosting (CatBoost), and extremely randomized trees (ET), to generate landslide susceptibility maps. Displacement velocity calculated by Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) is incorporated in the LSM. The results demonstrate that FFTR-RF achieves premium performance in the area under the curve (AUC) (94%), accuracy (87.31%), precision (87.21%), recall (88.02%), and F1-score (87.61%). Incorporating displacement velocity into LSM results predicted by models enhances the comprehensiveness of LSM. These methods will furnish early warning systems for landslide disasters along the KKH, thus aiding recommendations for mitigating landslides’ social and economic losses. © 2023 The Author(s).

We analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of historical geological hazards in Hunan Province from 2015 to 2022 using standard deviation ellipse, mean nearest neighbor, and kernel density estimation. We also employed three machine learning models to evaluate the susceptibility of geological hazards. Our research reveals that the frequency trends of landslide, debris flow, and collapse over time exhibit highly similar characteristics, and their high-density areas in spatial distribution significantly overlap. Spatial correlation analysis and kernel density estimation show that geological hazards tend to aggregate in certain areas. Central Hunan and its surrounding regions are high-density areas for geological hazards, with the most severe surface collapses occurring in the Loudi area. Geological hazards are more likely to occur at the intersection of various administrative regions, and landslides, in particular, manifest as multi-point distributions, forming a belt around cities—especially in the Hengyang area, surrounded by ridges and mountains. The locus of gravity shift for geological hazards is complex, yet the distance is small, and it primarily concentrates in and around Loudi. Lithology is the most crucial factor affecting geological hazards, followed by elevation and the topographic relief index. The extreme gradient boosting model achieved an AUC value of 0.786, outperforming the random forest and support vector machine models. The susceptibility assessment aligns closely with the kernel density estimation results.

Seventeen landslide-affecting factors were gathered for the modeling by considering the connection between previous landslide disasters and specific geo-environmental characteristics. Several statistical indicators were applied to verify the performance of predictive models. The analysis results of the ROC curve of the testing dataset indicated that all predictive models performed well, with the DA-FURIA model having the best precision, with an AUC value of 0.941, closely followed by the BA-FURIA model with an AUC of 0.930, the DE-FURIA model with an AUC of 0.926, and the FURIA model with an AUC of 0.910. The findings of this research may help with land-use planning and infrastructure building to ensure the long-term economic development of the area. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Modeling Earth Systems and Environment,10.1007/s40808-023-01888-y,0,0,No,,,"Viet Nam,China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The practice of landslide susceptibility mapping is crucial for the mitigation of risks connected with this natural disaster. This work aims at investigating the influence of varying sample sizes on the precision of landslide susceptibility modelling using a case study conducted in the Alamout basin, Iran. The researchers used a machine learning methodology based on tree algorithms to construct a model for predicting the likelihood of landslides. Additionally, they adopted a multi-scenario strategy to address the inherent uncertainty associated with the input data. The integration of the naive Bayes tree (NBTree), random forest (RF), logistic model tree (LMT) and J48 algorithms was performed. The modelling process included using 20 predictive parameters across four distinct scenarios. Four models, labelled S1, S2, S3 and S4, were used in this study. These models utilized 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the available inventory data. The research presented in this study is distinguished by using a tree-based methodology for landslide susceptibility modelling and incorporating a multi-scenario strategy to address the inherent uncertainty associated with the input data. The findings indicated that the augmentation of the sample size improved the precision of the models. The efficacy of using a multi-scenario strategy in enhancing the dependability of the model is also underscored. Among the 20 input elements used in the modelling process, it was seen that slope angle accounted for the highest relative significance, constituting 25.60% of the overall influence. Following more closely, distance to fault contributed significantly, with a relative importance of 23.40%. Additionally, rainfall and elevation exhibited notable contributions, with relative volumes of 7.91% and 5.50%, respectively. All four landslide models showed adequate learning and forecasting ability throughout the training and testing phases. During the testing phase, the true skill score (TSS) values exhibited a range of 0.631–0.804, while the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values showed a range of 0.745–0.921. The susceptibility maps indicated that a significant portion of the region exhibits moderate to very high susceptibility zones, with the northern and eastern sectors displaying greater landslide values than the western region. The model's performance showed improvement from S1 to S4 in both the training and testing phases. The performance of the models exhibited the following trend: in scenario 1, the RF model outperformed the J48, LMT and NBTree models; in scenario 2, the RF model surpassed the NBTree and LMT models, while being on par with the J48 model; in scenarios 3 and 4, the RF model showed superior performance compared to the NBTree, J48 and LMT models. Therefore, the RF model proved to be the most effective among the models evaluated. The findings derived from this research have the potential to serve as valuable references for the purposes of land-use planning and catastrophe risk management. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Geological Journal,10.1002/gj.4897,0,0,Yes,,,"China,Malaysia,Iran,Australia,Japan,Nigeria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study focuses on assessing landslide hazards in Utmah Region, Yemen. The evaluation involves comparing the effectiveness of the relative frequency ratio model with five machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for hazard mapping. Field surveys, high-resolution satellite imagery, and aerial photography were utilized in the study. The inventory map was generated after identifying and mapping 100 landslides. The inventory was then divided randomly into a training dataset (70 landslides) and a validation dataset (30 landslides), with an equal number of non-landslide pixels. Eleven additional landslide conditioning factors were collected from various sources, and the frequency ratio (FR) approach was employed to identify the most crucial variables for modeling. The models were rigorously tested and assessed using statistical metrics, including the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. The findings based on the training and validation datasets revealed that the RF algorithm (AUROC, 0.992) outperformed the other models in generating hazard maps. The XGBoost model (AUROC, 0.991), NB model (AUROC, 0.970), ANN model (AUROC, 0.922), KNN model (AUROC, 0.877), and FR (AUROC, 0.674) were found to be less effective.

In recent years, deep learning models have been applied in landslide susceptibility mapping, but some problems remain, such as gradient disappearance, explosion, and degradation. Additionally, the potential nonlinear temporal and spatial characteristics between landslides and environmental factors may not be captured, and nonlandslide points may be randomly selected in the susceptibility mapping process. To overcome these shortcomings, in this paper, an information-gate recurrent unit residual network (Information-GRUResNet) model is proposed to produce a landslide susceptibility map by combining existing landslide records and environmental factor data. The model uses the information theory method to produce the initial landslide susceptibility map. Then, representative grid units and landslide points are selected as input variables of the GRUResNet model, from which nonlinear temporal and spatial characteristics are extracted to produce a landslide susceptibility map. Changzhou town in Wuzhou, China, is selected as a case study, and it is verified that the Information-GRUResNet model can accurately produce a landslide susceptibility map for the selected area. Finally, the Information-GRUResNet model is compared with GRU, RF, and LR models. The experimental results show that the Information-GRUResNet model is more accurate than the other three models. © 2023 by the authors.",Forests,10.3390/f14030499,0,0,Yes,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the high susceptibility to landslides, the region lacks detailed studies. Therefore, this research introduces four advanced machine learning methods, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA), and Logistic Regression (LR), to perform landslide susceptibility mapping, as well as study of the connection between landslide occurrence and the complex regional geo-environmental context of Taounate province. Fifteen causative factors were extracted, and 255 landslide events were identified through fieldwork and satellite imagery analysis. All models performed very well (AUC > 0.954), while the CART model performed the best (AUC= 0.971). However, SVM demonstrated superior performance compared to other methods, achieving the highest accuracy (89.92%) and F1-measure (81.66%) scores on the training data, and the highest accuracy (83.01%), precision (81.74%), and specificity (79.46%) scores on the test data. The results do not necessarily indicate that LR and MDA have the lowest predictive ability, as they demonstrated high accuracy in terms of AUC and in some classification tasks. Moreover, they provide the significant advantage of easy interpretation of the geo-environmental processes that control landslides. Rainfall is the primary triggering factor of landslides in the study area. The majority of landslides occurred on slopes, particularly those located along rivers and faults, suggesting that landslides in the region are closely associated with active tectonics and precipitation. All four models predicted similar spatial distribution patterns in landslide susceptibility. The results showed that almost half of the area mainly in the north and northwest, has a very high susceptibility to landslides.

Our approach captures the complex interaction between natural terrain and human intervention and provides a novel framework for risk assessment and management. In this analysis, we performed a multicollinearity analysis to ensure the independence of predictor variables. We optimized deep learning models, including deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and a hybrid of CNN with long short-term memory (LSTM), using Bayesian techniques. This optimization achieved a high degree of precision in parameter tuning. In the study, multicollinearity analysis showed that no parameter exceeded the multicollinearity threshold of over 9. When evaluating accuracy, the CNN-LSTM model was found to be the most effective with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.96, while DNN and CNN also had high AUCs of 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. Spatially, the CNN model identified 16.28% of the total area as highly susceptible, while the hybrid CNN-LSTM model delineated 13.39%. Sobol’s sensitivity analysis emphasized critical factors such as slope, elevation and geology as well as the anthropogenic influence of distance to built-up (DTB).

A reliable, robust and reproducible development of such tools requires a thorough quantification of uncertainties, which are present in every step of computational workflow from input data, such as topography or release zone, to modelling framework used, e.g. numerical error. Methodology: Well-established methods from reliability analysis such as Point Estimate Method (PEM) or Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) can be used to investigate the uncertainty of model outputs. While PEM requires less computational resources, it does not capture all the details of the uncertain output. MCS tackles this problem, but creates a computational bottleneck. A comparative study is presented herein by conducting multiple forward simulations of landslide run-out for a synthetic and a real-world test case, which are used to construct Gaussian process emulators as a surrogate model to facilitate high-throughput tasks. Results: It was demonstrated that PEM and MCS provide similar expectancies, while the variance and skewness differ, in terms of post-processed scalar outputs, such as impact area or a point-wise flow height. Spatial distribution of the flow height was clearly affected by the choice of method used in uncertainty quantification. Discussion: If only expectancies are to be assessed then one can work with computationally-cheap PEM, yet MCS has to be used when higher order moments are needed. In that case physics-based machine learning techniques, such as Gaussian process emulation, provide strategies to tackle the computational bottleneck. It can be further suggested that computational-feasibility of MCS used in landslide risk assessment can be significantly improved by using surrogate modelling. It should also be noted that the gain in compute time by using Gaussian process emulation critically depends on the computational effort needed to produce the training dataset for emulation by conducting simulations.

This study presents a methodology for economic risk assessment of structures affected by rainfall-induced landslides using machine learning (ML). Random Forest and LightGBM algorithms were applied to develop ML-based landslide prediction models considering the spatial distributions of landslide conditioning and triggering factors. The rainfall index was calculated considering the temporal variation in rainfall and was used as a feature associated with rainfall intensity. The rainfall hazard curve, representing the relationship between the rainfall index and its annual exceedance probability, was statistically estimated using a generalised extreme value distribution. Rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility was assessed using an ML-based landslide prediction model and rainfall hazard curve. Finally, the risk curve associated with the economic loss from structures damaged by rainfall-induced landslides was estimated based on landslide susceptibility and structure distribution maps. In this study, LightGBM showed better prediction performance for evaluating rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility than Random Forest. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used to develop an appropriate risk-based disaster mitigation strategy. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study proposed an evaluation method that breaks down the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) into smaller regions and assesses the susceptibility of landslides to each sub-region in order to assess and resolve the effect of spatial heterogeneity within the entire reservoir area of the TGRA. This method uses a combination of certainty factors (CF) and machine learning models to identify the key factors of high susceptibility index. Three machine learning models—the support vector machine (SVM), the logistic regression (LR), and the gradient boosted descent tree (GBDT)—were improved in this study. These enhanced models incorporate CF, resulting in the creation of CF-LR, CF-SVM, and CF-GBDT models. The results of the zonal evaluation are superior to those of the direct overall assessment, according to the examination of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and CF-GBDT outperforms the other five models in terms of determining the susceptibility of the entire TGRA. The occurrence of regional heterogeneity in the TGRA is confirmed by the CF-GBDT model, which also takes into account the importance of landslide influence factors between Region I and Region II. By analyzing the impact of zonal evaluation on each district and county in the TGRA, the significance of zoning in the study of landslide susceptibility within large watersheds is emphasized, providing a new perspective for regional landslide susceptibility assessment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Natural Hazards,10.1007/s11069-023-06235-z,0,0,Yes,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to reveal the influence rules of the different proportional random errors in conditioning factors on the LSP uncertainties, and further explore a method which can effectively reduce the random errors in conditioning factors. The original conditioning factors are firstly used to construct original factors-based LSP models, and then different random errors of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% are added to these original factors for constructing relevant errors-based LSP models. Secondly, low-pass filter-based LSP models are constructed by eliminating the random errors using low-pass filter method. Thirdly, the Ruijin County of China with 370 landslides and 16 conditioning factors are used as study case. Three typical machine learning models, i.e. multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), are selected as LSP models. Finally, the LSP uncertainties are discussed and results show that: (1) The low-pass filter can effectively reduce the random errors in conditioning factors to decrease the LSP uncertainties. (2) With the proportions of random errors increasing from 5% to 20%, the LSP uncertainty increases continuously. (3) The original factors-based models are feasible for LSP in the absence of more accurate conditioning factors. (4) The influence degrees of two uncertainty issues, machine learning models and different proportions of random errors, on the LSP modeling are large and basically the same. (5) The Shapley values effectively explain the internal mechanism of machine learning model predicting landslide susceptibility.

It is often carried out by predicting possibility of landslide occurrence first from numerous landslides conditioning factors (LCFs), followed by partitioning areas with different landslide susceptibility levels. Numerous methods have been proposed for such a purpose, saying logistic regression (LR), deep learning methods, etc. Among these methods, LR is the most widely used in literature, which may be attributed to its good performance and easy-to-follow. However, few studies explore uncertainty and reliability of the LR in LSM. Furthermore, not all LCFs contribute significantly to the landslide occurrence, saying elevation, distance to roads, etc. How to objectively determine the most relevant LCFs is another issue that remains unsolved. This study proposes a Bayesian LR method for landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA), together with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation for parameter estimation. MCMC samples are used to determine the optimal model, and to quantify the uncertainty associated with the LSM. Real-life data from Shaanxi Province are used for illustration.

Common methods are mainly based on empirical relationships that provide the rainfall thresholds above which the occurrence of landslide phenomena is likely to be expected. In recent years, the use of machine learning approaches has gained popularity in landslide susceptibility analysis and prediction. To support the operational early warning system of Liguria Civil Protection Department for landslides hazard, we propose the implementation of a polynomial Kernel regularized least squares regression (KRLS) algorithm, for predicting the daily occurrence of shallow landslides in the five Alert Zones in Liguria (North Western Italy). The model provides an estimate of the number of landslides associated with the set of three different hydrological features, also used for the Hydrological Assessment procedure: the soil moisture, the accumulated precipitation over 12 h and the precipitation peak over 3 h. Results of the model are converted to an Alert Scenario of landslide occurrence, based on the magnitude of the expected event and identified according to the National and Regional legislation (Regional Civil Protection guidelines D.G.R. n. 1116, 23/12/2020). The performance of the predictive model (e.g. accuracy of 93%) is deemed satisfactory and the methodology is considered a valuable support to the operational early warning system of Liguria Civil Protection Department. The choice of predictive variables allows, in future development, the values obtained from historical data to be replaced by those obtained from meteorological forecast models, introducing the use of the developed model in the operational forecasting chain. © 2023, The Author(s).",Landslides,10.1007/s10346-023-02173-w,0,0,No,,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings indicate high and very high landslide susceptibility zones covering 35.1–41.32 km2 and 15.14–16.2 km2, respectively. The DCN model boasts the highest area under the curve (AUC) at 0.97, followed by CNN (0.94) and DNN (0.9), showcasing DCN's superiority. XAI analysis exposes significant residuals in CNN's posterior despite its high AUC. Notably, precipitation, slope, soil texture, and line density emerge as pivotal parameters for accurate landslide prediction.

This paper aims to build landslide event prediction models using several machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. The algorithms were trained with two different methods. The input of the algorithms was precipitation data obtained from the global satellite mapping of precipitation satellite observation, and the target was landslide event occurrence data obtained from the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management. Each algorithm provided some model candidates with different parameter settings for each method. As a result, there were 52 and 72 model candidates for both methods. The best model was then chosen from each method. The result shows that the model generated by generalized linear model was the best model for the first method and deep learning for the second one. Furthermore, the best models at each method gained 0.828 and 0.836 for the area under receiver operating characteristics curve, and their log-loss were 0.156 and 0.154. The second method, which used input data transformation, provided better performance. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Prediction accuracy is very essential to reduce the risk of slope instability. Traditional statistical learning methods have been widely used in early warning systems, but they cannot thoroughly explore the coupling effect among related factors, which often results in low prediction accuracy. This paper establishes an ensemble learning prediction model optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) to determine landslide susceptibility more quickly and efficiently. The model is based on 290 sets of slope cases containing height (H), slope angle (α), unit weight (γ), cohesion (c), friction angle (ϕ), and pore water pressure (ru). Two common algorithms are incorporated into the ensemble learning model: Xgboost and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). The area under the curve (AUC) of GA-GBDT and GA-Xgboost were found to be 0.928 and 0.933, respectively, both of which could predict landslide susceptibility better. Compared with multiple logistic regression and other machine learning algorithms, both GA-GBDT and GA-Xgboost models perform better in terms of accuracy and applicability. The study results demonstrate that the developed optimized machine learning model can accurately predict landslide susceptibility and that the parameters should be optimized on a case-by-case basis to achieve more accurate results after building a suitable machine model. The optimization model proposed in this paper can be an effective new method for the intelligent prediction of landslide susceptibility. © 2023 Binbin Zheng et al.",International Journal of Intelligent Systems,10.1155/2023/5525793,0,0,Yes,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various statistical and machine learning (ML) models are used in LSM, including SVM and ANFIS, which have shown promising results. However, determining which model performs better remains a key challenge. To address this issue, this paper aims to compare six hybrid models constructed with two well-known and powerful ML models, namely SVM and ANFIS, and three meta-heuristic algorithms, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), and Cultural Algorithm (CA), for LSM in a case study in western Serbia. In the process of building the models, 359 landslide sites and 14 determinants were used. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using several indexes, including Root Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). The modeling results showed that the SVM-GA model has the highest accuracy (AUROC = 0.78) in predicting landslide incidence, followed by the ANFIS-GA (AUROC = 0.775), SVM-CA (AUROC = 0.773), ANFIS-DE (AUROC = 0.771), SVM-DE (AUROC = 0.76), and ANFIS-CA (AUROC = 0.65) models in validation phase. Therefore, the study suggested that SVM-based hybrid models are more accurate than ANFIS-based models for LSM, and thus, modelers may use SVM-based hybrid models for such applications. This study provides valuable insights into identifying the most appropriate and effective models for LSM, which can help to mitigate the risks associated with landslides and ensure sustainable land-use practices.

The method applied the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using RStudio machine learning. Landslides were mapped using Sentinel Image and Orthomozaic photo interpretation from data acquisition using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The landslide control factor data was obtained through DEMNAS (National Digital Elevation Model) with a spatial resolution of 8 meters. Data normalisation was conducted using the Mix-Max method before it was processed using RStudio. The landslide existing for ANN workflow was processed using the Bioclim model. The results showed landslide susceptibility was categorised into four classes i.e., low susceptibility (29.83%), which was spatially spread on most in the lower slopes, moderate susceptibility (3.11%), high susceptibility (2.99%), and very high susceptibility (15.94) which is scattered on the upper slope to the middle slope of the watershed. The most significant factor influencing the landslide is the topography factor, with a Relative Importance (RI) value of 0.86; the hydrological factor, with an RI of 0.833 and the surface feature, with an RI of 0.355.

However, the traditional landslide susceptibility assessment lacks reasonable and effective criteria for the selection of negative (non-landslide) samples, which limit the modeling effect of machine learning models. This study proposes a semi-supervised fuzzy C-means clustering based on cosine Euclidean distance (C-SFCM) for reliable landslide negative sample selection, and the genetic particle swarm optimization (GAPSO) algorithm is used to optimize the initial clustering centers. Taking Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, China, as the study area, we selected nine factors, including topography, geological conditions, land cover and human activities as influencing factors for landslide susceptibility mapping, and construct the basic dataset with landslide catalogs. The C-SFCM is performed on the original data set containing a small number of landslide samples and unlabeled samples and to select the low affiliation data far away from the positive samples of landslides as reliable negative samples of landslides. Then, we construct three deep learning models, the 1D convolutional neural network gated recurrent unit (1D CNN-GRU), the 1D convolutional neural networks long short term memory (1D CNN-LSTM) and the deep neural network (DNN), and two traditional machine learning models, support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) for training and testing, respectively, and used them for landslide susceptibility mapping. The results show that C-SFCM has a more reasonable negative sample area, while it can identify the spatial characteristics of landslide samples and negative samples effectively than SFCM under traditional Euclidean distance. Compared with the random selection of negative samples scheme, the classifier trained on the C-SFCM-selected dataset has higher accuracy and better prediction capability for potential landslides. Furthermore, 1D CNN-GRU achieved the highest prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.918) in the C-SFCM scenario, with a 9.55% improvement compared to the random selection scenario. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Acta Geotechnica,10.1007/s11440-023-01950-0,0,0,Yes,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased human activity in landslide-prone areas has been a major contributor to the risk of landslide occurrences. Therefore, machine learning has been used in landslide studies to develop a landslide predictive model. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the most suitable sampling ratio for the predictive landslide model in the Langat River Basin (LRB) using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The landslide inventory was divided randomly into training and testing datasets using four sampling ratios (50:50, 60:40, 70:30, and 80:20). A total of 12 landslide conditioning factors were considered in this study, including the elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, topography wetness index (TWI), distance to the road, distance to the river, distance to faults, soil, lithology, land use, and rainfall. The evaluation model was performed using certain statistical measures and area under the curve (AUC). Finally, the most suitable predictive model was chosen based on the model validation results using the compound factor (CF) method. Based on the results, the predictive model with an 80:20 ratio indicates a realistic finding and was classified as the first rank among others. The AUC value for the training dataset is 0.931, while the AUC value for the testing dataset is 0.964.

Correlation analysis of the driving factors before landslide susceptibility analysis is crucial to obtain more accurate results and higher computational efficiency. This article presents an FR-weighted GeoDetector, which can, at different gridding scales, stably screen out the driving factors most relevant to historical landslides in the study area compared to the performance of the original GeoDetector. The correlation analysis result shows that the most relevant seven conditioning factors to historical landslides in the study area are: lithology, distance to road, elevation, slope, STI, SPI, and distance to faults. Four machine learning models (logistic regression [LR], random forest [RF], artificial neural network [ANN], and Xgboost) are implemented for landslide susceptibility analysis, demonstrating that such models can achieve higher accuracy with features filtered by the FR-weighted GeoDetector than with all features. The Xgboost models trained on seven and 12 features were used to generate landslide susceptibility maps. The overlay with historical landslides showed that the models trained on seven features generated a more reasonable landslide susceptibility map, proving that selecting crucial landslide conditioning factors is a better solution than using a full range of landslide conditioning factors. © 2023 The Author(s).

Assessment in broad areas is now primarily based on grid units, which do not have a clear physical meaning like slope units, and their accuracy is not ideal. Nevertheless, the large amount of manual editing, due to the incorrectly generated horizontal and vertical lines during slope unit partitioning, limits using slope units for rapid assessment over large areas. Hence, this paper proposes a reliable susceptibility assessment approach to solve this problem based on optimal slope units and negative samples involving prior knowledge. Precisely, an algorithm to automatically extract slope units is designed to eliminate fragmented and erroneous units. Second, a samples labeling index (SLI) is defined based on the certainty factors model to select negative samples reasonably.

However, the modeling process of LSP is constrained by various factors. This paper approaches the effect of landslide data integrity, machine-learning (ML) models, and non-landslide sample-selection methods on the accuracy of LSP, taking the Yinghu Lake Basin in Ankang City, Shaanxi Province, as an example. First, previous landslide inventory (totaling 46) and updated landslide inventory (totaling 46 + 176) were established through data collection, remote-sensing interpretation, and field investigation. With the slope unit as the mapping unit, twelve conditioning factors, including elevation, slope, aspect, topographic relief, elevation variation coefficient, slope structure, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), distance to road, distance to river, and rainfall were selected. Next, the initial landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) was obtained using the K-means algorithm, and non-landslide samples were determined using two methods: random selection and semi-supervised machine learning (SSML). Finally, the random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) machine-learning methods were used for modeling. The research results showed the following: (1) The performance of supervised machine learning (SML) (RF, ANN) is generally superior to unsupervised machine learning (USML) (K-means). Specifically, RF in the SML model has the best prediction performance, followed by ANN. (2) The selection method of non-landslide samples has a significant impact on LSP, and the accuracy of the SSML-based non-landslide selection method is controlled by the ratio of the number of landslide samples to the number of mapping units. (3) The quantity of landslides has an impact on how reliably the results of LSM are obtained because fewer landslides result in a smaller sample size for LSM, which deviates from reality. Although the results in this dataset are satisfactory, the zoning results cannot reliably anticipate the recently added landslide data discovered by the interpretation of remote-sensing data and field research. We propose that the landslide inventory can be increased by remote sensing in order to achieve accurate and impartial LSM since the LSM of adequate landslide samples is more reasonable. The research results of this paper will provide a reference basis for uncertain analysis of LSP and regional landslide risk management.",SUSTAINABILITY,10.3390/su152215836,0,0,Yes,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, the geospatial dataset of 21 influencing factors was extracted from 1847 historical landslide InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) points, which were taken as a sample for the Sino-Pakistani Karakorum Highway. Secondly, Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC), random forest feature selection (RFFS), and their combinations (SCC-RFFS) were selected at different grid resolutions to identify the essential influencing factors from the 21 original factors. A random division into training set (70%) and test set (30%) was performed. Then, the LSM models for the original influencing factors and the selected influencing factors were constructed separately using machine learning models. Finally, the reasonableness of the essential influencing factors was verified by comparing the accuracy of the models under different grid resolutions. The results show that (1) relief degree of land surface (RDLS), SPI, and rainfall have significant effects on landslide occurrence. (2) The primary elements (i.e., RDLS, slop, rainfall) are less affected by the grid resolution, while the secondary elements (TWI) are more affected by the grid resolution.

Investigating and identifying the characteristics of this uncertainty and determining more suitable connection methods are of significant importance for LSP. This study uses original 12 environmental factors data as well as calculated data from five connection methods, namely, probability statistics (PS), frequency ratio (FR), information volume (IV), index of entropy (IOE), and weight of evidence (WOE), as model input variables. Then, four machine learnings logistic regression (LR), Bayesian networks (BN), support vector machines (SVM) and C5.0 Decision Trees (C5.0 DT) are combined with the calculated data and the original data to create 24 unique combinations of connection methods and models. Under these 24 combinations, the uncertainty analysis of LSP modeling is conducted, using Huichang County of China as an example. The analysis entails accuracy assessment, statistical analysis of landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs), distribution patterns of LSIs and sensitivity analysis of the two uncertainty issues. The results show that: 1) LSP accuracies of the FR-, IV- and IOE-based models are comparable, but are lower than those of the WOE-based models, with those of the PS-based models being the worst. WOE has better nonlinear connection performance than the other methods. 2) LSP accuracies of individual models are slightly lower than those of coupled models, but their modeling efficiencies are higher than those of coupled models. 3) The machine learning is more sensitive than the connection method for LSP.

This highlights an urgent need for a highly accurate landslide susceptibility map to guide future development and risk mitigation strategies. Therefore, this study aims to (1) develop robust well-optimised deep learning (DL) models for predicting landslide susceptibility and (2) conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of each parameter influencing landslides. To achieve these aims, three advanced DL models-Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Bayesian-optimised CNN with an attention mechanism-were rigorously trained and validated. Model validation included eight matrices, calibration curves, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall curves. Multicollinearity was examined using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to ensure variable independence. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was used to interpret the models and explore the influence of parameters on landslide. Results showed that road networks significantly influenced the areas identified as high-risk zones. Specifically, in the 1-km buffer around roadways, CNN_AM identified 10.42% of the area as 'Very High' susceptibility-more than double the 4.04% indicated by DNN. In the extended 2-km buffer zone around roadways, Bayesian CNN_AM continued to flag a larger area as Very High risk (7.46%), in contrast to DNN's 3.07%. In performance metrics, CNN_AM outshined DNN and regular CNN models, achieving near-perfect scores in Area Under the Curve (AUC), precision-recall, and overall accuracy. Sensitivity analysis highlighted 'Soil Texture', 'Geology', 'Distance to Road', and 'Slope' as crucial for landslide prediction.

However, landslide multidimensional feature extraction, model generalization ability, and prediction quantification of deep learning are still challenging. This paper proposes a new approach, the landslide density-based bidirectional long short-term memory (LD-BiLSTM) model with multichannel input and an optimized sampling strategy to predict and map landslide susceptibility in active seismic mountainous areas of Sichuan Province, China. First, to ensure the generalization ability of the LD-BiLSTM model, other regions in Sichuan were selected as the model training area independent of the prediction area (Luding County). Multichannel landslide datasets were constructed to extract high-dimensional geospatial features of landslides. Subsequently, the landslide density of each grid cell was utilized as the label for the corresponding input sample. The LD-BiLSTM model was improved by using transfer learning and sampling optimization strategies, which makes our method attenuate the impact of historical landslide inventory deviation on the spatial susceptibility mode compared with the existing DL model, which usually uses landslide objects (LO) as input sample labels. Model performance evaluation results show that the LD-BiLSTM model (precision = 0.903, recall = 0.899, F1-score = 0.901, Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.940) outperformed the LO-BiLSTM model (precision = 0.812, recall = 0.815.

This study aims to develop a deep learning network for accurate point cloud landslide segmentation. The proposed dynamic graph attention network (DGA-Net) has four steps. First, the down-sampling and neighbor search are applied to generate the samples that effectively represent the relevant landslide information. Second, the edge features of neighbor points are constructed based on graph structure to extract and enhance point cloud features. Third, the attention mechanism assigns adaptive weights to edge features and aggregates them into new point features. Fourth, the graph structure, edge features, and attention weights are dynamically updated through the hierarchical structures, which enable an expanded receptive field. In the upper reach of the Jinsha River, point clouds were prepared for landslide segmentation. The controlled experiments were designed for effectiveness evaluation. The results reported that proposed DGA-Net achieved the highest mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.743 and F1-score of 0.786, which was over 6.7% and 3.6% mIoU higher than shallow machine learning and other deep learning models. Besides, we analyzed the effect of super parameters in sampling strategy and the segmentation threshold in prediction stage on the model performance. The results showed that the samples with suitable sampling diameters and appropriate neighboring points are beneficial for landslide segmentation, and using optimal thresholds to segment stacked multiple prediction values can improve mIoU by 6%. Furthermore, the visualized feature maps revealed that the proposed model can index landslide points in feature space, which is beneficial to construct graph structures and use attention to enhance features.

In such a large-scale interferometry scenario, many applications actually aim at monitoring localized deformation sparsely distributed in the interferogram. Thus, it is not effective to apply the time-series InSAR analysis to the whole image and identify the deformed targets from the derived velocity map.

Concretely, we compute for every location (using SAR pixels over 45 x 45 m) the temporal coherence matrix of the Interferometric SAR (InSAR) phase over 1 year. This normalized matrix of size 60, x, 60 (60 acquisition dates over 1 year) summarizes the reflectivity changes of the land. Two machine learning models, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have been developed to estimate land cover classification performances of 6 main land cover classes (such as forests, urban areas, water bodies, or pastures). The training database was created by projecting to the radar geometry the reference labeled CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map on the mountainous area of Grenoble, France. Upon evaluation, both models demonstrated good performances with an overall accuracy of 78% (SVM) and of 81% (CNN) over Chambery area (France). We show how, even with a spatially coarse training database, our model is able to generalize well, as a large part of the misclassifications are due to a low precision of the ground truth map. Although some less computationally expensive approaches (using optical data) could be available, this land cover mapping based on very different information, i.e., patterns of land changes over a year, could be complementary and thus beneficial; especially in mountainous regions where optical imaging is not always available due to clouds. Moreover, we demonstrated that the InSAR temporal coherence matrix is very informative, which could lead in the future to other applications such as automatic detection of abrupt changes as snow fall or landslides.",FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING,10.3389/frsen.2022.932491,0,0,No,,,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of the 2018 Kerala floods, this disaster-prone region experienced drought conditions. In order to lessen the effects of future disasters, it is also necessary to identify and evaluate the district's groundwater potential (GWP). This work used three machine-learning (ML) algorithms - Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Gradient Boosting (GB) - to model and produce GWP zonation maps for the Idukki district. Fourteen conditioning factors include elevation, slope, curvature, Topographic Roughness Index, lineament density, soil, geology, geomorphology, Topographic Wetness Index, Sediment Transport Index, drainage density, rainfall, land-use/land-cover (LULC), and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index that were adopted as input parameters in the modelling. All showed prominence when they were examined for feature importance using the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. The RF model outperformed the other two ML models in terms of fit, with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.92, while the GB and AdaBoost models displayed less fit, with AUC values of 0.90 and 0.88, respectively. GWP maps produced by each model were reclassified into five zones - very high to very low - it was discovered that the zones were evenly spread throughout the Idukki region.",WATER SUPPLY,10.2166/ws.2023.134,0,0,No,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the drones' benefits in emergency monitoring, security is been a main factor because of the existence of wireless connections for transmission. Therefore, this article introduces optimal deep learning with image encryption-based secure drone communication (ODLIE-SDC) technique. The major intention of the ODLIE-SDC technique lies in the effectual secure communication and classification process in emergency monitoring scenarios. To accomplish this, the presented ODLIE-SDC technique designs a hyperchaotic map-based image encryption technique and its optimal keys are produced by the use of a rider optimization algorithm (ROA). The image classification process is performed encompassing EfficientNet-B4-CBAM feature extraction and enhanced stacked autoencoder (ESAE) classification. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning of the EfficientNet-B4-CBAM technique takes place using the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm. The experimental validation of the ODLIE-SDC technique is tested on the AIDER dataset. The comprehensive comparative analysis reported the enhanced performance of the ODLIE-SDC technique over other existing approaches.",IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/access.2023.3324068,0,0,No,,,"Ethiopia,India,South Korea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Precipitation estimation over land and coastal regions is necessary for addressing the high degree of spatial heterogeneity of water availability and demand, and for resolving the extremes that modulate and amplify hazards such as flooding and landslides. Advancements in computation power along with unique high spatiotemporal and spectral resolution data streams from passive meteorological sensors aboard geosynchronous Earth-orbiting (GEO) and low Earth-orbiting (LEO) satellites offer exciting opportunities to retrieve information about surface precipitation phenomena using data-driven machine learning techniques. In this study, the capabilities of U-Net-like architecture are investigated to map instantaneous, summertime surface precipitation intensity at the spatial resolution of 2 km. The calibrated brightness temperature products from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) radiometer are combined with multispectral images (visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands) from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) aboard the GOES-R satellites as main inputs to the U-Net-like precipitation algorithm. Total precipitable water and 2-m temperature from the Global Forecast System (GFS) model are also used as auxiliary inputs to the model. The results show that the U-Net-like algorithm can capture fine-scale patterns and intensity of surface precipitation at high spatial resolution over stratiform and convective precipitation regimes. The evaluations reveal the potential of extracting relevant, high spatial features over complex surface types such as mountainous regions and coastlines. The algorithm allows users to interpret the inputs' importance and can serve as a starting point for further exploration of precipitation systems within the field of hydrometeorology.",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,10.1175/jhm-d-23-0006.1,0,0,No,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
