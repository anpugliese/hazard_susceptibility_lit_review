The estimation of surface PM2:5 concentrations has made intensive use of satellitederived aerosol products. However, it has been a great challenge to obtain high-quality and high-resolution PM2:5 data from both ground and satellite observations, which is essential to monitor air pollution over small-scale areas such as metropolitan regions. Here, the space-time extremely randomized trees (STET) model was enhanced by integrating updated spatiotemporal information and additional auxiliary data to improve the spatial resolution and overall accuracy of PM2:5 estimates across China. To this end, the newly released Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction AOD product, along with meteorological, topographical and land-use data and pollution emissions, was input to the STET model, and daily 1 km PM2:5 maps for 2018 covering mainland China were produced. The STET model performed well, with a high out-of-sample (out-of-station) cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89 (0.88), a low rootmean-square error of 10.33 (10.93) ?gm-3, a small mean absolute error of 6.69 (7.15) ?gm-3 and a small mean relative error of 21.28% (23.69 %). In particular, the model captured well the PM2:5 concentrations at both regional and individual site scales. The North China Plain, the Sichuan Basin and Xinjiang Province always featured high PM2:5 pollution levels, especially in winter. The STET model outperformed most models presented in previous related studies, with a strong predictive power (e.g., monthly R2 D 0:80), which can be used to estimate historical PM2:5 records. More importantly, this study provides a new approach for obtaining high-resolution and high-quality PM2:5 dataset across mainland China (i.e., ChinaHighPM2:5), important for air pollution studies focused on urban areas.

However, the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of air quality have not been fully considered in previous model development. This study attempts to establish a multi-time, multi-site forecasting model of Beijing's air quality by using deep learning network models based on spatiotemporal clustering and to compare them with a back-propagation neural network (BPNN). For the overall forecasting, the performances in next-hour forecasting were ranked in ascending order of the BPNN, the convolutional neural network (CNN), the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and the CNN-LSTM, with the LSTM as the optimal model in the multiple-hour forecasting. The performance of the seasonal forecasting was not significantly improved compared to the overall forecasting. For the spatial clustering-based forecasting, cluster 2 forecasting generally outperforms cluster 1 and the overall forecasting. Overall, either the seasonal or the spatial clustering-based forecasting is more suitable for the improvement of the forecasting in a certain season or cluster. In terms of model type, both the CNN-LSTM and the LSTM generally have better performance than the CNN and the BPNN.

Accordingly, a full-coverage high-resolution air pollutant data set with timely updates and historical long-term records is essential to support both research and environmental management. Here, for the first time, we develop a near real-time air pollutant database known as Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP, http://tapdata.org.cn/) that combines information from multiple data sources, including ground observations, satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), operational chemical transport model simulations, and other ancillary data such as meteorological fields, land use data, population, and elevation. Daily full-coverage PM2.5 data at a spatial resolution of 10 km is our first near real-time product. The TAP PM2.5 is estimated based on a two-stage machine learning model coupled with the synthetic minority oversampling technique and a tree-based gap-filling method. Our model has an averaged out-of-bag cross-validation R-2 of 0.83 for different years, which is comparable to those of other studies, but improves its performance at high pollution levels and fills the gaps in missing AOD on daily scale. The full coverage and near real-time updates of the daily PM2.5 data allow us to track the day-to-day variations in PM2.5 concentrations over China in a timely manner. The long-term records of PM2.5 data since 2000 will also support policy assessments and health impact studies.

Therefore, the accurate prediction of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ?2.5 ?m) is very significant in the management of human health and the decision-making of government for the environmental management. In this study, a spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term (LSTM) memory (CNN-LSTM) model (also called PM (particulate matter) predictor) was proposed and used to predict the next day's daily average PM2.5 concentration in Beijing City. The spatiotemporal correlation analysis using the mutual information (MI) was performed, considering not only the linear correlation but also nonlinear correlation between target and observation parameters; in addition, it was fully considered for the whole area of China with the target monitoring station as the center and also for the historic air quality and meteorological data. As a result, the spatiotemporal feature vector (STFV) which reflects both linear and nonlinear correlations between parameters was effectively constructed. The PM predictor secured a fast and accurate prediction performance by efficiently extracting the inherent features of the latent air quality and meteorological input data associated with PM2.5 through CNN and by fully reflecting the long-term historic process of input time series data through LSTM. The air quality and meteorological data from the 384 monitoring stations which represents the whole area of China with Beijing City as the center during the 3 years (Jan. 1st, 2015 to Dec. 31th, 2017) were used to verify the validity of the proposed method.

As a result, the analysis and prediction of air pollution has attracted a good deal of interest among researchers. The research areas include traditional machine learning, neural networks and deep learning. How to effectively and accurately predict air pollution becomes an important issue. In this paper, we propose an Aggregated LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model (ALSTM) based on the LSTM deep learning method. In this new model, we combine local air quality monitoring station, the station in nearby industrial areas, and the stations for external pollution sources. To improve prediction accuracy, we aggregate three LSTM models into a predictive model for early predictions based on external sources of pollution and information from nearby industrial air quality stations. We exploited the data with 17 attributes collected by Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency from 2012 to 2017 as the training data to build the ALSTM forecasting model, and we tested the model using the data collected in 2018. We conducted some experiments to compare our new ALSTM model with SVR (Support Vector Machine based Regression), GBTR (Gradient Boosted Tree Regression), LSTM, etc., in the prediction of PM2.5 for 1Â8 h, and evaluated them using various assessment techniques, such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

Indeed, there has been a significant increase in levels of environmental pollution in recent years. The aim of the work presented herein is to design an intelligent predictor for the concentrations of air pollutants over the next 2Â days based on deep learning techniques using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The best structure for its operation is then determined using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The new predictor based on intelligent computation relying on unsupervised learning, i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM) and optimization (i.e., PSO), is called the smart air quality prediction model (SAQPM). The main goal is to predict six the concentrations of six types of air pollution, viz. PM2.5 particulate matter, PM10, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). SAQPM consists of four stages. The first stage involves data collection from multiple stations (35 in this case). The second stage involves preprocessing of the data, including (a) separation of each station with an independent focus, (b) handle missing values, and (c) normalization of the dataset to the range of (0, 1) using the MinMaxScalar method. The third stage relates to building the predictor based on the LSTM method by identifying the best structure and parameter values (weight, bias, number of hidden layers, number of nodes in each hidden layer, and activation function) for the network using the functional PSO algorithm to achieve a goal. Thereafter, the dataset is split into training and testing parts based on the ten cross-validation principle. The training dataset is then used to build the predictor. In the fourth stage, evaluation results for each station are obtained by reading the concentration of each pollutant each hour for at most 30Â days then taking the average of the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) for 25Â days only.

This NO2 model covers the entire contiguous U.S. with daily predictions on 1-km-level grid cells from 2000 to 2016. The ensemble produced a cross-validated R2 of 0.788 overall, a spatial R2 of 0.844, and a temporal R2 of 0.729. The relationship between daily monitored and predicted NO2 is almost linear. We also estimated the associated monthly uncertainty level for the predictions and address-specific NO2 levels. This NO2 estimation has a very high spatiotemporal resolution and allows the examination of the health effects of NO2 in unmonitored areas. We found the highest NO2 levels along highways and in cities. We also observed that nationwide NO2 levels declined in early years and stagnated after 2007, in contrast to the trend at monitoring sites in urban areas, where the decline continued.

Air quality prediction is to issue an alarm when severe pollution occurs, or pollution concentration exceeds a specific limit, contributing to the measure-taking of relevant departments, guiding urban socio-economic activities to promote sustainable urban development. However, existing methods have failed to make full use of the temporal features from spatiotemporal correlations of air quality monitoring stations, and achieved poor performances in long-term predictions (up to or above 24h-predictions). In this study, we proposed a deep learning framework to predict air quality in the following 24 h: a neural network with a temporal sliding long short-term memory extended model (TS-LSTME). The model integrated the optimal time lag to realize sliding prediction through multi-layer bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM), involving the hourly historical PM2.5 concentration, meteorological data, and temporal data. We applied the proposed model to predict the next 24 h average PM2.5 concentration in Jing-Jin-Ji region, with the most severe air pollution in China. The proposed model had better stability and performances with high correlation coefficient R2 (0.87), compared to the multiple linear regression (MLR), the support vector regression (SVR), the traditional LSTM, and the long short-term memory extended (LSTME) models. Moreover, the proposed model can achieve PM2.5 concentration predictions with high accuracy in long-term series (48 h and 72 h). We also tested the model to predict O3 concentration. The proposed model could be applied for other air pollutants. The proposed methods can significantly improve air quality prediction information services for the public and provide support for early warning and management of regional pollutants.

However, in-situ measurements of the ozone concentration before 2013 in China are quite scarce, which cannot facilitate the assessment of the long-term trends and effects of ozone pollution. In this study, we used daily maximum 8-hour average (MDA8) ozone observations from 2013 to 2017 combined with concurrent ozone retrievals, aerosol reanalysis, meteorological parameters, and land-use data to establish a nationwide MDA8 prediction model based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. The model achieves high prediction accuracy compared with other studies, with R2 values for the by-year, site-based, and sample-based cross-validation (CV) schemes of 0.61, 0.64, and 0.78, respectively, at the daily level. External testing with regional measurements from 2005 to 2012 and nationwide data in 2018 have shown that the model is robust and reliable for historical data prediction, with external model testing R2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.87 at the month level in different years. Using the final estimator, we obtained nationwide monthly mean ozone concentrations from 2005 to 2012 and daily MDA8 ozone concentrations from 2013 to 2017 at a resolution of 0.1Â° Ã 0.1Â°. According to the average number of days exceeding the standard and the average of the 90th percentile of the MDA8 ozone concentrations, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Jianghan Plain, the Sichuan Basin, and the Northeast Plain regions were identified as pollution hotspots. During the research period, the overall ozone levels fluctuated slightly, and their trends were not spatially continuous. There was a significant increasing trend in the BTH region by 1.37 (95% CI: 0.46,2.29) ?g/m3/year between 2013 and 2017. In 2017, 26.24% of the population lived in areas exceeding the Chinese grade II national air quality standard, which shows that ozone pollution has posed an obvious threat to population health in China.

Earlier studies have used machine learning (ML) and statistical modeling to classify and forecast air pollution. However, these methods suffer from the complexity of air pollution dataset resulting in a lack of efficient classification and forecasting of air pollution.ML-based models suffer from improper data preprocessing, class imbalance issues, data splitting, and hyperparameter tuning. There is a gap in the existing ML-based studies on air pollution due to improper data handling and optimization. The present investigation aims to bridge these gaps and aid in effective air pollution classification and forecasting. Five ML models were developed, including one novel model named SMOTEDNN (SyntheticMinority Oversampling Technique with Deep Neural Network) to address air pollution classification. All five models utilized efficient data pre-processing and rigorous hyperparameter optimization. Three forecasting models were developed to forecast air pollution for one step-index based on statistical autoregression. All developed models in present investigation showed higher accuracy.

At the same time, being able to model, predict, and monitor air quality is becoming more and more relevant, especially in urban areas, due to the observed critical impact of air pollution on citizens' health and the environment. In this paper, we employ a popular machine learning method, support vector regression (SVR), to forecast pollutant and particulate levels and to predict the air quality index (AQI). Among the various tested alternatives, radial basis function (RBF) was the type of kernel that allowed SVR to obtain the most accurate predictions. Using the whole set of available variables revealed a more successful strategy than selecting features using principal component analysis. The presented results demonstrate that SVR with RBF kernel allows us to accurately predict hourly pollutant concentrations, like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ground-level ozone, and particulate matter 2.5, as well as the hourly AQI for the state of California. Classification into six AQI categories defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency was performed with an accuracy of 94.1% on unseen validation data.

The governments and scholars have spent lots of effort on controlling air pollution and mitigating its impacts on human society. Accurate prediction of air quality can provide essential decision-making supports, and therefore, scholars have proposed various kinds of models and methods for air quality forecastings, such as statistical methods, machine learning methods, and deep learning methods. Deep learning-based networks, such as RNN and LSTM, have been reported to achieve good performance in recent studies. However, the excellent performance of these methods requires sufficient data to train the model. For stations that lack data, such as newly built monitoring stations, the performance of those methods is constrained. Therefore, a methodology that could address the data shortage problem in new stations should be explored. This study proposes a transfer learning-based stacked bidirectional long short term memory (TLS-BLSTM) network to predict air quality for the new stations that lack data. The proposed method integrates advanced deep learning techniques and transfer learning strategies to transfer the knowledge learned from existing air quality stations to new stations to boost forecasting. A case study in Anhui, China, was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of TLS-BLSTM.

Here, we used the combination of a machine learning model, statistical method, and chemical transport model to quantify the meteorological impacts on PM2.5 pollution during 2000-2018. Specifically, we first developed a two-stage machine learning PM2.5 prediction model with a synthetic minority oversampling technique to improve the satellite-based PM2.5 estimates over highly polluted days, thus allowing us to better characterize the meteorological effects on haze events. Then we used two methods to examine the meteorological contribution to PM2.5: a generalized additive model (GAM) driven by the satellite-based full-coverage daily PM2.5 retrievals and the Weather Research and Forecasting/Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF/CMAQ) modeling system. We found good agreements between GAM estimations and the CMAQ model estimations of the meteorological contribution to PM2.5 on a monthly scale (correlation coefficient between 0.53-0.72). Both methods revealed the dominant role of emission changes in the long-term trend of PM2.5 concentration in China during 2000-2018, with notable influence from the meteorological condition. The interannual variabilities in meteorology-associated PM2.5 were dominated by the fall and winter meteorological conditions, when regional stagnant and stable conditions were more likely to happen and when haze events frequently occurred. From 2000 to 2018, the meteorological contribution became more unfavorable to PM2.5 pollution across the North China Plain and central China but were more beneficial to pollution control across the southern part, e.g., the Yangtze River Delta. The meteorology-adjusted PM2.5 over eastern China (denoted East China in figures) peaked in 2006 and 2011, mainly driven by the emission peaks in primary PM2.5 and gas precursors in these years. Although emissions dominated the long-term PM(2.5 )trends, the meteorology-driven anomalies also contributed -3.9 % to 2.8 % of the annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in eastern China estimated from the GAM. The meteorological contributions were even higher regionally, e.g., -6.3 % to 4.9 % of the annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, -5.1 % to 4.3 % in the Fenwei Plain, -4.8 % to 4.3 % in the Yangtze River Delta, and -25.6 % to 12.3 % in the Pearl River Delta.

To reduce air pollution concentrations, and warn the public regarding the occurrence of hazardous air pollutants, an accurate and reliable air pollutant forecasting model must be designed. However, previous studies had numerous deficiencies, such as ignoring the importance of predictive stability and poor initial parameters; these deficiencies significantly affected the air pollution prediction performance. Therefore, in this study a novel hybrid model is proposed to address these issues. Powerful data preprocessing techniques are applied to decompose the original time series into different modes from low frequency to high frequency, and a new multi-objective Harris hawks optimization algorithm is developed to tune the parameters of the extreme learning machine (ELM) model with high forecasting accuracy and stability for prediction air pollution. The optimized ELM model is then used to predict a time-series of air pollution. Finally, a scientific and robust evaluation system with several error criteria, benchmark models, and experiments conducted using twelve air pollutant concentration time series from three cities in China is designed to assess the presented hybrid forecasting model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid model can achieve a more stable and higher predictive performance than other models, and its superior prediction ability may aid in developing effective plans for mitigating air pollutant emissions and preventing the health issues caused by air pollution.

Accordingly, it is very relevant predicting air quality. Although the application of the machine learning (ML) models for predicting air quality parameters, such as PM concentrations, has been evaluated in previous studies, those on the spatial hazard modeling of them are very limited. Due to the high potential of the ML models, the spatial modeling of PM can help managers to identify the pollution hotspots. Accordingly, this study aims at developing new ML models, such as Random Forest (RF), Bagged Classification and Regression Trees (Bagged CART), and Mixture Discriminate Analysis (MDA) for the hazard prediction of PM10 (particles with a diameter less than 10 Âµm) in the Barcelona Province, Spain. According to the annual PM10 concentration in 75 stations, the healthy and unhealthy locations are determined, and a ratio 70/30 (53/22 stations) is applied for calibrating and validating the ML models to predict the most hazardous areas for PM10. In order to identify the influential variables of PM modeling, the simulated annealing (SA) feature selection method is used. Seven features, among the thirteen features, are selected as critical features. According to the results, all the three-machine learning (ML) models achieve an excellent performance (Accuracy > 87% and precision > 86%). However, the Bagged CART and RF models have the same performance and higher than the MDA model.

Since Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are the major pollutants, various models have been developed on predicting their potential damages. Nevertheless, providing precise predictions is almost impossible. In this study, a new hybrid intelligent model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and multi-verse optimization algorithm (MVO) has been developed to predict and analysis the air pollution obtained from Combined Cycle Power Plants. In the proposed model, long short-term memory model is a forecaster engine to predict the amount of produced NO2 and SO2 by the Combined Cycle Power Plant, where the MVO algorithm is used to optimize the LSTM parameters in order to achieve a lower forecasting error. In addition, in order to evaluate the proposed model performance, the model has been applied using real data from a Combined Cycle Power Plant in Kerman, Iran. The datasets include wind speed, air temperature, NO2, and SO2 for five months (MayÂSeptember 2019) with a time step of 3-h. In addition, the model has been tested based on two different types of input parameters: type (1) includes wind speed, air temperature, and different lagged values of the output variables (NO2 and SO2); type (2) includes just lagged values of the output variables (NO2 and SO2). The obtained results show that the proposed model has higher accuracy than other combined forecasting benchmark models (ENN-PSO, ENN-MVO, and LSTM-PSO) considering different network input variables.

Machine Learning (ML) methods in conjunction with spatiotemporal modeling can provide more flexible exposure-relevant metrics and have been studied using different model structures. There is however a lack of comparisons of methods available within these two modeling frameworks, that can guide model/algorithm selection in air quality epidemiology. Objective: The present study compares thirteen algorithms for spatial/spatiotemporal modeling applied for daily maxima of 8-hour running averages of ambient ozone concentrations at spatial resolutions corresponding to census tracts, to support estimation of annual ozone design values across the contiguous US. These algorithms were selected from nine representative categories and trained using predictors that included chemistry-transport model predictions, meteorological factors, land use and land cover, and stationary and mobile emissions. Methods: To obtain the best predictive performance, model structures were optimized through a repeated coarse/fine grid search with expert knowledge. Six target-oriented validation strategies were used to prevent overfitting and avoid over-optimistic model evaluation results. In order to take full advantage of the power of different algorithms, we introduced tuning sample weights in spatiotemporal modeling to ensure predictive accuracy of peak concentrations, that is crucial for exposure assessments. In spatial modeling, four interpretation and visualization tools were introduced to explain predictions from different algorithms. Results: Nonlinear ML methods achieved higher prediction accuracy than linear LUR, and the improvements were more significant for spatiotemporal modeling (nearly 10%-40% decrease of predicted RMSE). By tuning the sample weights, spatiotemporal models can predict concentrations used to calculate ozone design values that are comparable or even better than spatial models (nearly 30% decrease of cross-validated RMSE). We visualized the underlying nonlinear relationships, heterogeneous associations and complex interactions from the two best performing ML algorithms, i.e., Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting, and found that the complex patterns were relatively less significant with respect to model accuracy for spatial modeling. Conclusion: Machine Learning can provide estimates that are actually more interpretable and practical than linear regression to improve accuracy in modeling human exposures. A careful design of hyperparameter tuning and flexible data splitting and validations is crucial to obtain reliable and stable results. Desirable/successful nonlinear models are expected to capture similar nonlinear patterns and interactions using different ML algorithms.

In air quality assessment and epidemiological studies, peak concentrations can be important metrics. For instance, the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) use an ozone design value (DV), defined as the 3-year average of the annual 4th highest daily maximum 8-hour ozone concentration, to identify nonattainment areas with DV > 70 ppb (USEPA, 2018). Previous work has mostly focused on predicting annual averages of ambient air pollutant concentrations, and reported validation results were based on all samples, where low concentrations are dominant, while the prediction capability for peak concentrations cannot be guaranteed. Second, ML models are âblack-boxâ formulations and are considered to be less interpretable than the well-known linear regression models. It should be noted that it is not only important to construct models with higher prediction accuracy, but also to use the models to better explain the effects of different covariates on observed responses. Previous studies mainly used variable importance measures to improve the interpretability of ML models, while comprehensive studies for interpretable ML (Molnar, 2019) in air pollutant concentration estimation are rare.
 
 To fill the gaps discussed above, the present study implemented a comprehensive framework to compare thirteen ML algorithms for fine resolution estimation of ambient ozone concentrations. We developed spatiotemporal models to estimate Daily Maximum 8-Hour Average (DM8HA) ozone concentrations, and spatial models to estimate the annual 4th highest DM8HA (herein denoted as DVm) across the CONUS in 2011. For fair comparison, rigorous hyperparameter tuning and flexible targeted validations were conducted to maximize the performance of each algorithm. Sample weight tuning was designed to balance global accuracy and peak accuracy for spatiotemporal models, and various interpretation and visualization tools were applied to show that the so-called âblack-boxâ ML models can actually be âtransparentâ. The findings of this work can provide guidance on the selection of efficient modeling tools and algorithms for air pollution epidemiology and environmental health studies.","R2 and RMSE for training, cross validation, spatial, temporal, peak and external validation",Yes,Dimensionality reduction,NS,,NS,,NS,,NS,,NS,,"We also included latitude and longitude to capture spatial trends, and day of the year to capture temporal trends of ambient ozone concentrations."

In particular, the surface concentrations of air pollutants are closely related to human life. This study aims to develop models for estimating high spatial resolution surface concentrations of NO2 and O3 from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data in East Asia. The machine learning was adopted by fusion of various satellite-based variables, numerical model-based meteorological variables, and land-use variables. Four machine learning approachesÂSupport Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)Âwere evaluated and compared with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as a base statistical method. This study also modeled the NO2 and O3 concentrations over the ocean surface (i.e., land model for scheme 1 and ocean model for scheme 2). The estimated surface concentrations were validated through three cross-validation approaches (i.e., random, temporal, and spatial). The results showed that the NO2 model produced R2 of 0.63Â0.70 and normalized root-mean-square-error (nRMSE) of 38.3Â42.2% and the O3 model resulted in R2 of 0.65Â0.78 and nRMSE of 19.6Â24.7% for scheme 1. The indirect validation based on the stations near the coastline for scheme 2 showed slight decrease (~0.3Â2.4%) in nRMSE when compared to scheme 1. The contributions of input variables to the models were analyzed based on SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. The NO2 vertical column density among the TROPOMI-derived variables showed the largest contribution in both the NO2 and O3 models.

Atmospheric chemical-transport models can provide air pollutant forecasts with high temporal and spatial resolution and are widely used for routine air quality predictions (e.g., 1Â3 days in advance). However, the modelÂs performance is limited by uncertainties in the emission inventory and biases in the initial and boundary conditions, as well as deficiencies in the current chemical and physical schemes. As a result, experimentation with several new methods, such as machine learning, is occurring in the field of air quality forecasting. This study combined hourly PM2.5 mass concentration forecasts from an operational air quality numerical prediction system (WRF-Chem) at the Shanghai Meteorological Service (SMS) with comprehensive near-surface measurements of air pollutants and meteorological conditions to develop a machine learning model that estimates the daily PM2.5 mass concentration in Shanghai, China. With correlation coefficients that are higher by 50Â100% and a standard deviation that is lower by 14Â24 Âµg mÂ3, the machine learning model provides significantly better daily forecasting of PM2.5 than the WRF-Chem model.

The multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 1-km resolution was employed as a primary predictor to estimate PM2.5concentrations. Imputation techniques were adopted to fill in the missing AOD retrievals and provide accurate long-term AOD aggregations.

This study utilized a land use regression (LUR) model with machine learning to assess the spatial-temporal variability of PM2.5. Daily average PM2.5 data was collected from 73 fixed air quality monitoring stations that belonged to the Taiwan EPA on the main island of Taiwan. Nearly 280,000 observations from 2006 to 2016 were used for the analysis. Several datasets were collected to determine spatial predictor variables, including the EPA environmental resources dataset, a meteorological dataset, a land-use inventory, a landmark dataset, a digital road network map, a digital terrain model, MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) database, and a power plant distribution dataset. First, conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR were utilized to identify the important predictor variables. Then, deep neural network, random forest, and XGBoost algorithms were used to fit the prediction model based on the variables selected by the LUR models. Data splitting, 10-fold cross validation, external data verification, and seasonal-based and county-based validation methods were used to verify the robustness of the developed models. The results demonstrated that the proposed conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR models captured 58% and 89% of PM2.5 variations, respectively. When XGBoost algorithm was incorporated, the explanatory power of the models increased to 73% and 94%, respectively.

The severe level of PM2.5 directly affects the public health, economics and social development. Due to the strong nonlinearity and instability of the air quality, it is difficult to predict the volatile changes of PM2.5 over time. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model VMD-BiLSTM is constructed, which combines variational mode decomposition (VMD) and bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM), to predict PM2.5 changes in cities in China. VMD decomposes the original PM2.5 complex time series data into multiple sub-signal components according to the frequency domain. Then, BiLSTM is employed to predict each sub-signal component separately, which significantly improved forecasting accuracy. Through a comprehensive study with existing models, such as the EMD-based models and other VMD-based models, we justify the outperformance of the proposed VMD-BiLSTM model over all compared models. The results show that the prediction results are significantly improved with the proposed forecasting framework. And the prediction models integrating VMD are better than those integrating EMD.

We have evaluated the model for 21 continuous ambient monitoring stations (CAMS) across Texas. The inputs for the CNN model consist of meteorology (e.g., wind field, temperature) and air pollution concentrations (NO x and ozone) from the previous day. The model is trained for predicting next-day, 24-hour ozone concentrations. We acquired meteorological and air pollution data from 2014 to 2017 from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). For 19 of the 21 stations in the study, results show that the yearly index of agreement (IOA) is above 0.85, confirming the acceptable accuracy of the CNN model. The results also show the model performed well, even for stations with varying monthly trends of ozone concentrations (specifically CAMS-012, located in El-Paso, and CAMS-013, located in Fort Worth, both with IOA=0.89). In addition, to ensure that the model was robust, we tested it on stations where fewer meteorological variables are monitored. Although these stations have fewer input features, their performance is similar to that of other stations. However, despite its success at capturing daily trends, the model mostly underpredicts the daily maximum ozone, which provides a direction for future study and improvement. As this model predicts ozone concentrations 24 h in advance with greater accuracy and computationally fewer resources, it can serve as an early warning system for individuals susceptible to ozone and those engaging in outdoor activities.

However, existing methods for PM2.5 concentration prediction neglect the effects of featured states at different times in the past on future PM2.5 concentration, and most fail to effectively simulate the temporal and spatial dependencies of PM2.5 concentration at the same time. With this consideration, we propose a deep learning-based method, AC-LSTM, which comprises a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and attention-based network, for urban PM2.5 concentration prediction. Instead of only using air pollutant concentrations, we also add meteorological data and the PM2.5 concentrations of adjacent air quality monitoring stations as the input to our AC-LSTM. Hence, the spatiotemporal correlation and interdependence of multivariate air quality-related time-series data are learned by the CNN-LSTM network in AC-LSTM. The attention mechanism is applied to capture the importance degrees of the effects of featured states at different times in the past on future PM2.5 concentration. The attention-based layer can automatically weigh the past feature states to improve prediction accuracy. In addition, we predict the PM2.5 concentrations over the next 24 h by using air quality data in Taiyuan city, China, and compare it with six baseline methods. To compare the overall performance of each method, the mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and coecient of determination (R2) are applied to the experiments in this paper.

Here, we have created a prediction model for daily PM2.5 levels in the Greater London area from 1st January 2005 to 31st December 2013 using an ensemble machine learning approach incorporating satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), land use, and meteorological data. The predictions were made on a 1 km x 1 km scale over 3960 grid cells. The ensemble included predictions from three different machine learners: a random forest (RF), a gradient boosting machine (GBM), and a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) approach. Our ensemble model performed very well, with a ten-fold cross-validated R2 of 0.828. Of the three machine learners, the random forest outperformed the GBM and KNN. Our model was particularly adept at predicting day-to-day changes in PM2.5 levels with an out-of-sample temporal R2 of 0.882.

Among air pollutants, Particulate Matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 ?m (PM2.5) is a serious health problem. It causes various illnesses such as respiratory tract and cardiovascular diseases. Hence, it is necessary to accurately predict the PM2.5 concentrations in order to prevent the citizens from the dangerous impact of air pollution beforehand. The variation of PM2.5 depends on a variety of factors, such as meteorology and the concentration of other pollutants in urban areas. In this paper, we implemented a deep learning solution to predict the hourly forecast of PM2.5 concentration in Beijing, China, based on CNN-LSTM, with a spatial-temporal feature by combining historical data of pollutants, meteorological data, and PM2.5 concentration in the adjacent stations. We examined the difference in performances among Deep learning algorithms such as LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, Bi-GRU, CNN, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model.

Existing methods have gone through the development from deterministic methods, statistical methods, to machine learning and deep learning methods. The latest direction lies in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based methods. They are a special kind of deep learning network, and can not only well model non-linear real-world problems, but also consider the impact of long-historical values. These methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in air quality predictions, but some gaps have not been well addressed, especially the overlook on the multi-sequential-variants, and the lack of efficient parameter optimization in the deep learning models. To this end, this study proposes a Lag-FLSTM (Lag layer-LSTM-Fully Connected network) model based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) for multivariant air quality prediction. A case study in the U.S. is conducted to test the method. The results showed that Lag-FLSTM has at least 23.86 % lower RMSE than other methods. The contributions of this study are that we not only developed a deep learning method that can automatically optimize the model parameters but also studied how different metrological features and other pollutants affect the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations.

And identifies the ranking of major factors, local meteorological conditions have become a nonnegligible factor. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is used here to enhance the interpretability of the model and we visualize and analyze the reasons for the different correlation between traffic density and PM2.5 concentration in various regions of Shanghai. Meanwhile, As the strict and effective industrial emission reduction measurements implementing in China, the contribution of urban traffic to PM2.5 formation calculated by combining MEIC emission inventory and LRP is gradually increasing from 18.03% in 2011 to 24.37% in 2017 in Shanghai, and the impact of traffic emissions would be ever-prominent in 2030 according to our prediction. We also infer that the promotion of vehicular electrification would achieve further alleviation of PM2.5 about 8.45% by 2030 gradually.

Remote monitoring PM2.5 using satellite-based data would be incredibly advantageous to this effort, but current machine learning methods lack necessary interpretability and predictive accuracy. This study details the development of a new Spatial-Temporal Interpretable Deep Learning Model (SIDLM) to improve the interpretability and predictive accuracy of satellite-based PM2.5 measurements. In contrast to traditional deep learning models, the SIDLM is both ÂwideÂ and Âdeep.Â We comprehensively evaluated the proposed model in China using different input data (top-of-atmosphere (TOA) measurements-based and aerosol optical depth (AOD)-based, with or without meteorological data) and different spatial resolutions (10 km, 3 km, and 250 m). TOA-based SIDLM PM2.5 achieved the best predictive accuracy in China, with root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 15.30 and 15.96 ?g/m3, and R2 values of 0.70 and 0.66 for PM2.5 predictions at 10 km and 3 km spatial resolutions, respectively. Additionally, we tested the SIDLM in PM2.5 retrievals at a 250 m spatial resolution over Beijing, China (RMSE = 16.01 ?g/m3, R2 = 0.62). Furthermore, SIDLM demonstrated higher accuracy than five machine learning inversion methods, and also outperformed them regarding feature extraction and the interpretability of its inversion results. In particular, modeling results indicated the strong influence of the Tongzhou district on the principle PM2.5 in the Beijing urban area. SIDLM-extracted temporal characteristics revealed that summer months (JuneÂAugust) might have contributed less to PM2.5 concentrations, indicating the limited accumulation of PM2.5 in these months.

The three ten-folded cross-validations (CV) methods including sample-based, time-based, and spatial-based validation combined with Coefficient Square (R2), Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Predictive Error (MPE) have been used for validation at different temporal scales in terms of daily, monthly, heating seasonal, and non-heating seasonal. Finally, the distribution map of PM2.5 concentrations was illustrated based on the RF model. Some findings were achieved. The RF model performed well, with a relatively high sample-based cross-validation R2 of 0.74, a low RMSE of 16.29 ?g Ã m?3, and a small MPE of ?0.282 ?g Ã m?3.

The national models with high spatiotemporal resolutions to predict ground ozone concentrations are limited in China so far. In this study, we aimed to develop a random forest model by combining ground ozone measurements from fixed stations, ozone simulations from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system, meteorological parameters, population density, road length, and elevation to predict ground maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) ozone concentrations at a daily level and 1 km Ã 1 km spatial resolution. The model cross-validation R2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) were 0.80 and 20.93 ?g/m3 at daily level in 2013Â2019, respectively. CMAQ ozone simulations and near-surface temperature played vital roles in predicting ozone concentrations among all predictors. The population-weighted median concentrations of predicted MDA8 ozone were 89.34 ?g/m3 in mainland China in 2013, and reached 100.96 ?g/m3 in 2019. However, the long-term temporal variations among regions were heterogeneous. Central and Eastern China, as well as the Southeast Coastal Area, suffered higher ozone pollution and higher increased rates of ozone concentrations from 2013 to 2019. The seasonal pattern of ozone pollution varied spatially. The peak-season ozone pollution with the highest 6-month ozone concentrations occurred in different months among regions, with more than half domain in AprilÂSeptember. The predictions showed that not only the annual mean concentrations but also the percentages of grid-days with MDA8 ozone concentrations higher than 100/160 ?g/m3 have been increasing in the past few years in China; meanwhile, majority areas in mainland China suffered peak-season ozone concentrations higher than the air quality guidelines launched by the World Health Organization in September 2021. The proposed model and ozone predictions with high spatiotemporal resolution and full coverage could provide health studies with flexible choices to evaluate ozone exposure levels at multiple spatiotemporal scales in the future.

In contrast to the traditional methods, the prediction technologies based on machine learning techniques are proved to be the most efficient tools to study such modern hazards. The present work investigates six years of air pollution data from 23 Indian cities for air quality analysis and prediction. The dataset is well preprocessed and key features are selected through the correlation analysis. An exploratory data analysis is exercised to develop insights into various hidden patterns in the dataset and pollutants directly affecting the air quality index are identified. A significant fall in almost all pollutants is observed in the pandemic year, 2020. The data imbalance problem is solved with a resampling technique and five machine learning models are employed to predict air quality. The results of these models are compared with the standard metrics. The Gaussian Naive Bayes model achieves the highest accuracy while the Support Vector Machine model exhibits the lowest accuracy.

Modeling of the complex relationships between these variables by sophisticated methods in machine learning is a promising field. The objectives of this work are to develop a supervised model for the prediction of air pollution by using real sensor data and to transfer the model between cities. The combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory deep neural network model was proposed to predict the concentration of air pollutants in multiple locations of a city by using spatial-temporal relationships. Two approaches have been adopted: the univariate model contains the information of one pollutant whereas the multivariate model contains the information of all pollutants and meteorology data for prediction. The study was carried out for different pollutants which are in the publicly available data of the cities of Barcelona, Kocaeli, and ?stanbul. The hyperparameters of the model (filter, frame, and batch sizes; number of convolutional/LSTM layers and hidden units; learning rate; and parameters for sample selection, pooling, and validation) were tuned to determine the architecture that achieved the lowest test error. The proposed model improved the prediction performance (measured by the root mean square error) by 11Â53% for particulate matter, 20Â31% for ozone, 9Â47% for nitrogenoxides, and 18Â46% for sulfurdioxide with respect to the 1-hidden layer long short-term memory networks utilized in the literature. The multivariate model without using meteorological data revealed the best results. Regarding transfer learning, the network weights were transferred from the source city to the target city. The model has more accurate prediction performance with the transfer of the network from Kocaeli to ?stanbul as those neighbor cities have similar air pollution and meteorological characteristics.

This study proposes a hybrid deep learning predictor, in which the PM2.5 data are decomposed into components by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) firstly, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is built to classify all the components into a fixed number of groups based on the frequency characteristics. Then, a gated-recurrent-unit (GRU) network is trained for each group as the sub-predictor, and the results from the three GRUs are fused to obtain the prediction result.

In addition to alert the public for health concerns, accurate ozone prediction is also crucial to understand the formation mechanisms of surface ozone episodes, and has significant implications for making emission control strategies of ozone precursors such as methane, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds. However, existing methods of ozone concentration prediction could not effectively capture temporal dependency, and most neglect spatial correlations. In this study, a hybrid sequence to sequence model embedded with the attention mechanism is proposed for predicting regional ground-level ozone concentration. In the proposed model, the inherent spatiotemporal correlations in air quality monitoring network are simultaneously extracted, learned and incorporated, and auxiliary air pollution and meteorological information are adaptively involved. The hourly data collected from 35 air quality monitoring stations and 651 meteorological girds in Beijing, China are used to validate the present model. The results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal correlations in the monitoring network present enormous advantages for the regional ozone prediction. Auxiliary data and time lags matching day-of-week or diurnal periods of ozone are confirmed to benefit the improvement of prediction accuracy. Monitoring stations in urban areas exhibit better prediction performances than stations in remote areas.

To dynamically monitor fine particulate matter over large geographic areas, some machine learning methods have been utilized to estimate its concentration using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD). To improve the estimation of PM2.5 concentration across large areas, a geospatial-temporal joint code is proposed in this paper to characterize the influence of spatial-temporal information hidden in satellite-based aerosol products. This encoding method can reveal the relationship between the PM2.5 concentration and its geospatial location and observation time. Instead of aggregating observation data over neighbors, the method directly encodes the spatial-temporal information as features of the end-to-end gradient boosting model for the estimation of PM2.5. Experimental results of PM2.5 concentration in 2019 across China show that the state-of-the-art method is outperformed by the proposed method by a large margin, with R2 from 0.89 to 0.92, RMSE from 10.35 to 7.89 ?g/m3, and MAE from 6.71 to 5.17 ?g/m3.

Existing studies of air pollutant prediction are mostly interdisciplinary involving environmental science and computer science where the problem is formulated as time series prediction. A prevalent recent approach to time series prediction is the Encoder-Decoder model, which is based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) such as long short-term memory (LSTM), and great potential has been demonstrated. An LSTM network relies on various gate units, but in most existing studies the correlation between gate units is ignored. This correlation is important for establishing the relationship of the random variables in a time series as the stronger is this correlation, the stronger is the relationship between the random variables. In this paper we propose an improved LSTM, named Read-first LSTM or RLSTM for short, which is a more powerful temporal feature extractor than RNN, LSTM and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). RLSTM has some useful properties: (1) enables better store and remember capabilities in longer time series and (2) overcomes the problem of dependency between gate units. Since RLSTM is good at long term feature extraction, it is expected to perform well in time series prediction. Therefore, we use RLSTM as the Encoder and LSTM as the Decoder to build an Encoder-Decoder model (EDSModel) for pollutant prediction in this paper. Our experimental results show, for 1 to 24 h prediction, the proposed prediction model performed well with a root mean square error of 30.218.

Missing data is a common issue for all the domains, especially for environmental data analysis.

This research study presents a novel deep learning-based hybrid model architecture to solve these issues in a single training process. We come up with Multi-directional Temporal Convolutional Artificial Neural Network (MTCAN) model to impute and forecast PM2.5 pollutant concentration in a single training process. The main idea of the multi-directional properties of MTCAN is to interpolate the PM2.5 pollutant feature matrix to impute its value. Ultimately, it maintains the temporal correlation within the features' measurement and meteorological and pollutant variables to impute PM2.5 missing values. The MTCAN model performs feature learning and sequential modeling simultaneously with a wide range of past observations for long-term forecasting, minimizing memory size requirement and training cost.

In this study, we selected Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, temperature, wind speed and elevation data to analyze the impact of each variable on PM2.5 in different regions of China. The results show that the high-value areas of PM2.5 were mainly concentrated in the North China Plain, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain, the Sichuan Basin, and the Tarim Basin. PM2.5 showed an upward trend in North China, Northeast China and Northwest China, while in most of South China, especially the Sichuan Basin, PM2.5 showed a downward trend. Therefore, the northern region of China needs to take measures to curb the growth of PM2.5. In Northwest China, wind speed and temperature had a greater impact on PM2.5. In North China, wind speed had a greater impact on PM2.5. In southern China, temperature and NDVI had a greater impact on PM2.5. The deep learning model can better simulate the spatial distribution of PM2.5 based on the selected variables. The clustering effect of single variable is better than multivariate spatial information clustering based on principal component analysis (PCA).

This paper reports a robust forecasting system to achieve accurate multi-step ahead forecasting of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. First, correlation analysis is adopted to screen the spatial information on pollution and meteorology that may facilitate the prediction of concentrations in a target city. Then, a spatial–temporal attention mechanism is used to assign weights to original inputs from both space and time dimensions to enhance the essential information. Subsequently, the residual-based convolutional neural network with feature extraction capabilities is employed to model the refined inputs. Finally, five accuracy metrics and two additional statistical tests are applied to comprehensively assess the performance of the proposed forecasting system.

The results demonstrated that machine learning techniques can skillfully summarize and visibly present the clusted spatio-temporal PM2.5 features as well as improve air quality prediction accuracy.

Poor air quality does not have only serious adverse effects on human health and vegetation but also some major negative political, societal, and economic impacts. Hence, it is essential to invest more effort on accurate forecasting of ambient air pollution to provide practical and relevant solutions, achieve acceptable air quality, and plan for prevention. In this work, we propose a flexible and efficient deep learning-driven model to forecast concentrations of ambient pollutants. This article introduces first the traditional variational autoencoder (VAE) and the attention mechanism to develop the forecasting modeling strategy based on the innovative integrated multiple directed attention (IMDA) deep learning architecture. To assess the performance of the proposed forecasting methodology, experimental validation is then performed using air pollution data from four US states. Six statistical indicators have been used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy. A discussion of the results obtained finally demonstrates the satisfying performance of integrated multiple directed attention variational autoencoder (IMDA-VAE) methods to forecast different pollutants in different locations. Furthermore, results indicate that the proposed IMDA-VAE model can effectively improve air pollution forecasting performance and outperforms the deep learning models, namely VAE, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), bidirectional LSTM, bidirectional GRU, and ConvLSTM. We also showed that the forecasting results of the proposed model surpass the performance of LSTM and GRU with the attention mechanism.

It is vital for us to predict the air quality for determining the further prevention measures of avoiding the brought disasters. In this paper, we are going to propose an approach of predicting the air quality based on the multiple data features through fusing the multiple machine learning models. The approach takes the meteorological data and air quality data for the past six days as one batch of input (the whole data set is for 46 days) and employs a multi-model fusion to provide an improved 24-hour prediction of PM2.5 pollutant concentration all over Beijing. During the above process, two focal feature groups are composed. The first focal feature group contains the historical meteorological data, while the second group includes the statistical information, the date information and the polynomial variations. Besides the two groups, we complement one million more data items by employing the time sliding means. Among the supplementary data, we select the most critical 500 features with Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model and send the features as the input to Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and LightGBM models. Meanwhile, we screen the most critical 300 features with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model and send them as the input to the three prediction models. Referring to each of the models, we respectively gain the optimal parameters through grid search methods and then fuse the modelsÂ contribution with the linear weighting. The experiments indicate that the proposed approach based on the weighting fusion is better than that provided by a single modeling scheme, and the loss value is 0.4158 under the SMAPE index.

Precise forecast of PM2.5 concentrations is very important to control air pollution and improve people's life quality. In the subway indoor air quality (IAQ) system, the data collected by telemonitoring systems is frequently lost due to many reasons. A deep learning model called RF-CNN-GRU, which combines random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), is proposed to predict atmospheric PM2.5 concentrations with incomplete original data. The RF-CNN-GRU model employs the RF to fill in missing values in the data and subsequently applies the CNN to extract features from the imputed data. The data is finally sent to the GRU network to train and predict PM2.5 concentrations. Comparing with single CNN, GRU and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, the predictive accuracy of the RF-CNN-GRU model is significantly improved. The RF-CNN-GRU model shows a slight improvement in prediction results when compared to models such as CNN-GRU, RF-CNN, RF-GRU, and RF-LSTM.

Air pollution predictions can provide accurate information on the future pollution situation, effectively controlling air pollution.

In this paper, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal deep learning algorithm based on bidirectional gated recurrent unit integrated with attention mechanism (BiAGRU), for more accurate air quality forecasting. The historical air quality measurements and meteorological monitoring data were constructed as a spatial-temporal matrix suitable for model input.

Therefore, making accurate predictions of PM2.5 is a crucial task. Due to the transportation of air pollutants among areas, the PM2.5 concentration is strongly spatiotemporal correlated. However, the distribution of air pollution monitoring sites is not even making the spatiotemporal correlation between the central site and surrounding sites vary with different density of sites, and this was neglected by previous methods. To this end, this study proposes a weighted long short-term memory neural network extended model (WLSTME), which addressed the issue that how to consider the effect of the density of sites and wind conditions on the spatiotemporal correlation of air pollution concentration. First, a number of nearest surrounding sites were chosen as the neighbor sites to the central site, and their distance, as well as their air pollution concentration and wind condition, were input to multilayer perception (MLP) to generate weighted historical PM2.5 time series data. Second, historical PM2.5 concentration of the central site and weighted PM2.5 series data of neighbor sites were input into a long short-term memory (LSTM) to address spatiotemporal dependency simultaneously and extract spatiotemporal features. Finally, another MLP was utilized to integrate spatiotemporal features extracted above with the meteorological data of the central site to generate the forecasts future PM2.5 concentration of the central site. Daily PM2.5 concentration and meteorological data on BeijingÂTianjinÂHebei from 2015 to 2017 were collected to train models and to evaluate its performance. Experimental results with three existing methods showed that the proposed WLSTME model has the lowest RMSE (40.67) and MAE (26.10) and the highest p (0.59). Further experiments showed that in all seasons and regions, WLSTME performed the best. This finding confirms that WLSTME can significantly improve PM2.5 prediction accuracy.

From a public health perspective, PM2.5 is one of the primary air pollutants, especially in Tehran's metropolis. Owing to the different patterns of PM2.5 in different seasons, Spatio-temporal modeling and identification of high-risk areas to reduce its effects seems necessary. The purpose of this study was Spatio-temporal modeling and preparation of PM2.5 risk mapping using three machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF), AdaBoost, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD)) in the metropolis of Tehran, Iran. Therefore, in the first step, to prepare the dependent variable data, the PM2.5 average was used for the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Then, using remote sensing (RS) and a geographic information system (GIS), independent data such as temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, rainfall, humidity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population density, street density, and distance to industrial centers were prepared as a seasonal average. To Spatio-temporal modeling using machine learning algorithms, 70% of the data were used for training and 30% for validation. The frequency ratio (FR) model was used as input to machine learning algorithms to calculate the spatial relationship between PM2.5 and the effective parameters. Finally, Spatio-temporal modeling and PM2.5 risk mapping were performed using three machine learning algorithms. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) results showed that the RF algorithm had the greatest modeling accuracy, with values of 0.926, 0.94, 0.949, and 0.949 for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively.

However, the existing PM2.5 concentration prediction methods cannot effectively capture the complex nonlinearity of PM2.5 concentration, and most of them cannot accurately simulate the temporal and spatial dependence of PM2.5 concentration at the same time. In this paper, we propose an attention-based parallel network (APNet), which can extract short-term and long-term temporal features simultaneously based on the attention-based CNN-LSTM multilayer structure to predict PM2.5 concentration in the next 72 h. Firstly, the Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC) is designed for spatiotemporal correlation analysis, fully considering the linearity, non-linearity and non-functionality between the data of each monitoring station. The potential inherent features of the input data are effectively extracted through the convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, an optimized long short-term memroy (LSTM) network captures the short-term mutations of the time series. An attention mechanism is further designed for the proposed model, which automatically assigns different weights to different feature states at different time stages to distinguish their importance, and can achieve precise temporal and spatial interpretability. In order to further explore the long-term time features, we propose a Bi-LSTM parallel module to extract the periodic characteristics of PM2.5 concentration from both previous and posterior directions. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset indicates that the proposed model outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, evaluations of recall (0.790), precision (0.848) (threshold: 151 ?g/m3) for 72 h prediction also verify the feasibility of our proposed model.

Monitoring, modeling, and forecasting air quality would be a prudent way to promote awareness and defend human beings from the adversities of air pollution. The air quality of a region is monitored through various air quality monitoring stations built in and around it. The air quality data collected from these stations are highly dynamic, nonlinear, and hold intensely stochastic spatiotemporal correlations in them. Deep learning algorithms that are capable of extracting a higher level of abstraction in data can efficiently capture the spatiotemporal features in it. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deep learning model named DL-Air that embodies three components for air quality forecasting. The first component, the encoder, encodes all spatial relations in the data. The second component, STAA-LSTM, a proposed variant of LSTM, identifies all temporal relations and the level of association between the identified spatiotemporal relation and the forecast. Also, the STAA-LSTM predicts the future spatiotemporal relations in the latent space. The third component, decoder suitably decodes these relations to obtain the actual forecast. The proposed framework was extensively evaluated for forecasting the real-world air quality data of Delhi. DL-Air shows better performance with around 30% reduced RMSE and MAE, 37% reduced AAD, 11% improved R2 and 8% improved accuracy in AQI category prediction than the best performing baseline approaches.

The inability to assess PM2.5 concentrations have limited the assessment of the health impact of these exposures, both in the native populations and previously deployed military personnel. As part of a Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program health study of land-based U.S. military personnel who were previously deployed to these countries, we developed a novel approach to estimate spatially and temporarily resolved daily PM2.5 exposures 2001Â2018. Since visibility is proportional to ground-level particulate matter concentrations, we were able to take advantage of extensive airport visibility data that became available as a result of regional military operations over this time period. First, we combined a random forest machine learning and a generalized additive mixed model to estimate daily high resolution (1 km Ã 1 km) visibility over the region using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) and airport visibility data. The spatially and temporarily resolved visibility data were then used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations from 2001 to 2018 by converting visibility to PM2.5 using empirical relationships derived from available regional PM2.5 monitoring stations. We adjusted for spatially resolved meteorological parameters, land use variables, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and satellite-derived estimates of surface dust as a measure of sandstorm activity. Cross validation indicated good model predictive ability (R2 = 0.71), and there were considerable spatial and temporal differences in PM2.5 across the region. Annual average PM2.5 predictions for Iraq and Kuwait were 37 and 41 ?g/m3, respectively, which are greater than current U.S. and WHO standards. PM2.5 concentrations in many U.S. bases and large cities (e.g. Bagdad, Balad, Kuwait city, Karbala, Najaf, and Diwaniya) had annual average PM2.5 concentrations above 45 ?g/m3 with weekly averages as high as 150 ?g/m3 depending on calendar year. The highest annual PM2.5 concentration for both Kuwait and Iraq were observed in 2008, followed by 2009, which was associated with extreme drought in these years. The lowest PM2.5 values were observed in 2014. On average, July had the highest concentrations, and November had the lowest values, consistent with seasonal patterns of air pollution in this region. This is the first study that estimates long-term PM2.5 exposures in Iraq and Kuwait at a high resolution based on measurements data that will allow the study of health effects and contribute to the development of regional environmental policies.

However, the scientific understanding of the ways in which complex interactions of meteorological factors lead to high-pollution episodes is inconclusive. In this study, a novel, data-driven approach based on empirical relationships is used to characterize and better understand the meteorology-driven component of PM1 variability. A tree-based machine learning model is set up to reproduce concentrations of speciated PM1 at a suburban site southwest of Paris, France, using meteorological variables as input features. The model is able to capture the majority of occurring variance of mean afternoon total PM1 concentrations (coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.58), with model performance depending on the individual PM1 species predicted. Based on the models, an isolation and quantification of individual, season-specific meteorological influences for process understanding at the measurement site is achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) regression values. Model results suggest that winter pollution episodes are often driven by a combination of shallow mixed layer heights (MLHs), low temperatures, low wind speeds, or inflow from northeastern wind directions. Contributions of MLHs to the winter pollution episodes are quantified to be on average similar to 5 mu g/m(3) for MLHs below < 500 m a.g.l. Temperatures below freezing initiate formation processes and increase local emissions related to residential heating, amounting to a contribution to predicted PM1 concentrations of as much as similar to 9 mu g/m(3). Northeasterly winds are found to contribute similar to 5 mu g/m(3) to predicted PM1 concentrations (combined effects of u- and v -wind components), by advecting particles from source regions, e.g. central Europe or the Paris region. Meteorological drivers of unusually high PM1 concentrations in summer are temperatures above similar to 25 degrees C (contributions of up to similar to 2.5 mu g/m(3)), dry spells of several days (maximum contributions of similar to 1.5 mu g/m(3)), and wind speeds below similar to 2 m/s (maximum contributions of similar to 3 mu g/m(3)), which cause a lack of dispersion. High-resolution case studies are conducted showing a large variability of processes that can lead to high-pollution episodes. The identification of these meteorological conditions that increase air pollution could help policy makers to adapt policy measures, issue warnings to the public, or assess the effectiveness of air pollution measures.",ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS,10.5194/acp-21-3919-2021,37,13,Yes,GBDT,,No,"Germany,France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high ozone concertation (OZC) affects the environment and public health. Since OZC depends on the number of different variables, it is difficult and complex to predict ozone concertation. A multilayer perceptron model is robust for predicting ozone concertation, although it has some limitations. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model may be unable to extract spatial and temporal features from time series data. Additionally, modelers need to developed models for handling unstructured and structured data. The purpose of this study is to combine deep learning models with MLP models to extract spatial and temporal features and improve the accuracy of predictions. We coupled deep learning models with the MLP model to overcome the limitations of the MLP model. We propose two new hybrid deep models for predicting ozone concertation. Graph convolutional network (GCN)-Long short term memory neural network (LSTM)-multi layer perceptron model (MLP)- Gaussian progress models (GPR) and convolutional neural network (CNN)-LSTM-MLP-GPR are introduced to predict hourly ozone concentration. Novelties of the papers include the development of a new model for spatial feature extraction, the introduction of a new model for temporal feature extraction, and the quantification of uncertainty. Spatial features can be extracted using CNN and GCN models. The LSTM model is a robust model for extracting temporal features. The GPR model quantifies uncertainty values. We use the models to predict ozone concentrations in three stations of Malaysia and one basin in Iran (Sefidrood basin). For the first case study (Malaysian stations), air pollution data and meteorological data were used. GCN-LSTM-MLP-GPR decreased the training MAE of CNN-LSTM-MLP-GPR, CNN-MLP-GPR, GNC-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, GCN-MLP, CNN-MLP, GCN-GPR, CNN-GPR, LSTM-GPR, MLP-GPR, GCNN, CNN, LSTM, MLP, and GPR by 1.7%, 9.2%, 14%, 15%, 18%, 21%, 22%, 27%, 30%, 32%, 34%, 35%, 37%, 42%, and 50% respectively at station 1. At station 2, the PBIAS of the CNN-LSTM-MLP-GPR and GCN-LSTM-LSTM-GPR was 2 and 4%, respectively. The testing MAE of the GCN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, GCN-MLP, and CNN-MLP was 0.130, 0.131, 0.133, and 0.141 at station 3. In the Sefidrrod basin, the GCN-LSTM-MLP-GPR decreased the MAE of the GCN, CNN, LSTM, MLP, and GPR models by 53%, 55%, 56%, 57%, and 59%, respectively. The uncertainty analysis indicated that the uncertainty of the GCN-LSTM-MLP-GPR model was lower than that of the CNN-LSTM-MLP-GPR, CNN-MLP-GPR, GNC-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, GCN-MLP, CNN-MLP, GCN-GPR, CNN-GPR, LSTM-GPR, MLP-GPR, GCNN, CNN, LSTM, MLP, and GPR model.

This problem has been exacerbated by an overabundance of automobiles, industrial output pollution, transportation fuel consumption, and energy generation. As a result, air pollution forecasting has become vital. As a result of the large amount and variety of data acquired by air pollution monitoring stations, air pollution forecasting has become a popular topic, particularly when applying deep learning models of long short-term memory (LSTM). The ability of these models to learn long-term dependencies in air pollution data sets them apart. However, LSTM models using many other statistical and machine learning approaches may not offer adequate prediction results due to noisy data and improper hyperparameter settings. As a result, to define the pollution levels for a group of contaminants, an ideal representation of the LSTM is required. To address the problem of identifying the best hyperparameters for the LSTM model, In this paper, we propose a model based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) algorithm as well as the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm. The model aims to find the best hyperparameters for LSTM and the pollution level for the next day using four types of pollutants PM10, PM2.5, CO, and NOX.

Air quality index (AQI) can directly reflect the degree of air pollution. Accurate AQI trend prediction can provide reliable information for the prevention and control of air pollution, but traditional forecasting methods have limited performance. To this end, a dual-scale ensemble learning framework is proposed for the complex AQI time series prediction. First, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and sample entropy (SE) are used to decompose and reconstruct AQI series to reduce the difficulty of direct modeling. Then, according to the characteristics of high and low frequencies, the high-frequency components are predicted by the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), and the low-frequency items are predicted by the regularized extreme learning machine (RELM). At the same time, the improved whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is used to optimize the hyper-parameters of RELM and LSTM models. Finally, the hybrid prediction model proposed in this paper predicts the AQI of four cities in China. This work effectively improves the prediction accuracy of AQI, which is of great significance to the sustainable development of the cities.

Flexible statistical methods for prediction have demonstrated the integration of satellite observations with other predictors, yet these algorithms are susceptible to overfitting the spatiotemporal structure of the training datasets. We present a new approach for predicting PM2.5 using machine-learning methods and evaluating prediction models for the goal of making predictions where they were not previously available. We apply extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) modeling to predict daily PM2.5 on a 1 Ã 1 km2 resolution for a 13 state region in the Northeastern USA for the years 2000Â2015 using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth and implement a recursive feature selection to develop a parsimonious model. We demonstrate excellent predictions of withheld observations but also contrast an RMSE of 3.11 ?g/m3 in our spatial cross-validation withholding nearby sites versus an overfit RMSE of 2.10 ?g/m3 using a more conventional random ten-fold splitting of the dataset. As the field of exposure science moves forward with the use of advanced machine-learning approaches for spatiotemporal modeling of air pollutants, our results show the importance of addressing data leakage in training, overfitting to spatiotemporal structure, and the impact of the predominance of ground monitoring sites in dense urban sub-networks on model evaluation. The strengths of our resultant modeling approach for exposure in epidemiologic studies of PM2.5 include improved efficiency, parsimony, and interpretability with robust validation while still accommodating complex spatiotemporal relationships.

However, most of the previous forecasting models only considered either temporal or spatial prediction. The effects of different inputs, model structures and leading hours on the model performance were still less investigated. In this study, three kinds of deep learning neural networks (the long short-term memory (LSTM), the convolutional neural networks (CNN), and CNN-LSTM) were developed for 1- to 24-h forecasting of spatiotemporal PM2.5 concentrations. The back propagation neural network (BPNN) was employed as the control model. Three types of input data (previous PM2.5 concentrations plus meteorological data, air quality data and the six most correlated variables, respectively) at multiple stations in Beijing from 2015 to 2016 were employed for model development. The results showed that PM2.5 concentrations in the past hours, hybrid air quality indexes or other pollutant concentrations, and wind speed can be used as good candidate predictors. For the 1-h forecasting, the LSTM and the CNN-LSTM with the most correlated variables were the best models with top 2 performance. For the 2- to 24-h forecasting, the LSTM was the optimal model for forecasting over 12 h while the CNN-LSTM was generally better for forecasting within 12 h. This study demonstrated that deep learning outperformed shallow learning models in hourly PM2.5 forecasting and suggested that optimizing the input and structure of the model helped to improve the performance of multiple-hour PM2.5 forecasting.

By incorporating wavelet decomposition (WD) into the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a hybrid XGBoost-WD model was established to obtain the full-coverage PM2.5 estimation at 3-km spatial resolution in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA). In this study, 3-km-resolution meteorological fields simulated by WRF along with AOD derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were served as explanatory variables. Model MW and Model NW were developed using XGBoost-WD for the areas with and without AOD respectively to obtain a full-coverage PM2.5 mapping in the YRDUA. The XGBoost-WD model showed good performances in estimating PM2.5 with R2 of 0.80 in the Model MW and 0.87 in the Model NW. Moreover, the K-value of Model MW increased from 0.77 to 0.79 and that of Model NM increased from 0.81 to 0.86 compared with the model without the step of WD, indicating an improvement on the problem of PM2.5 underestimation. Due to a better ability of capturing abrupt changes in the PM2.5 concentrations, the spatial evolution of PM2.5 during a typical pollution event could be mapped more accurately. Finally, the analysis of variable importance showed that the three most important variables in the estimation of the low-frequency coefficients of PM2.5 (PM2.5_A4) were temperature at 2 m (T2), day of year (DOY) and longitude (LON), while that in the high-frequency coefficients of PM2.5 (PM2.5_D) were CO, AOD and NO2. This study not only provided an effective solution to the PM2.5 underestimation and AOD missing problems in the PM2.5 estimation, but also proposed a new method to further refine the sophisticated correlations between PM2.5 and some spatiotemporal variables.

In this study, we systematically examined the spatiotemporal variations of six air pollutants and conducted ozone prediction using machine learning (ML) algorithms in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The annual-average concentrations of CO, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 decreased at a rate of 141, 11.0, 6.6 and 5.6 ?g/m3/year, while a pattern of initial increase and later decrease was observed for NO2 and O3_8 h. The concentration of SO2, CO and NO2 was higher in Tangshan and Xingtai, while northern BTH region has lower levels of CO, NO2 and PM. Spatial variations of ozone were relatively small in the BTH region. Monthly variations of PM10 displayed an increase in March probably due to wind-blown dusts from Northwest China. A seasonal and diurnal pattern with summer and afternoon peaks was found for ozone, which was contrast with other pollutants. Further ML algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) model and Decision tree (DT) regression showed good ozone prediction performance (daily: R2 = 0.83 and 0.73, RMSE = 30.0 and 37.3 ?g/m3, respectively; monthly: R2 = 0.93 and 0.88, RMSE = 12.1 and 15.8 ?g/m3, respectively) based on 10-fold cross-validation. Both RF model and DT regression relied more on the spatial trend as higher temporal prediction performance was achieved. Solar radiation- and temperature-related variables presented high importance at daily level, whereas sea level pressure dominated at monthly level. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity in variable importance was further confirmed using case studies based on RF model. In addition, variable importance was possibly influenced by the emission reductions due to COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its possible weakness to capture ozone extremes, RF model was beneficial and suggested for predicting spatiotemporal variations of ozone in future studies.

Air quality prediction can provide useful information for urban environmental governance decision-making and residentsÂ daily health control. However, existing research methods have suffered from a weak ability to capture the spatial correlations and fail to model the long-term temporal dependencies of air quality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-scale spatiotemporal graph convolution network (MST-GCN), which consists of a multi-scale block, several spatial-temporal blocks and a fusion block. We first divide the extracted features into several groups based on their domain categories, and represent the spatial correlations across stations as two graphs. Then we combine the grouped features and the constructed graphs in pairs to form a multi-scale block that feeds into spatial-temporal blocks. Each spatial-temporal block contains a graph convolution layer and a temporal convolution layer, which can model the spatial correlations and long-term temporal dependencies. To capture the group interactions, we use a fusion block to fuse multiple groups. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our model achieves the highest performance compared with state-of-the-art and baseline models for air quality prediction.

Predicting PM2.5 can help the administration to warn people at risk and make scientific measures to reduce pollution. Existing work has utilized various regression models to predict air pollution; however, different feature selection techniques with the regression algorithm have not yet been explored. This paper has implemented five feature selection techniques (namely, Recursive Feature Elimination, Analysis of Variance, Random Forest, Variance Threshold, and Light Gradient Boosting) to select the best features. Further, six regression algorithms and ensemble models (Extra Tree, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Random Forest, Light GBM, and AdaBoost) are applied to predict PM2.5 using python language on the dataset of five cities of China. The models are compared based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R2 parameters. We observed that the AdaBoost algorithm with the Light GBM feature selection technique gives the highest performance among all the five datasets.

Although conventional statistical and machine learning methods have been widely used for air quality forecasting, they have limitations in finding nonlinear relations and modeling sequential data. In recent years, deep learning methods such as long short-term memory, recurrent neural networks, and gated recurrent units have been successfully applied in several research areas, including time-series forecasting. In this study, deep learning algorithm is employed to predict the PM2.5 dataset, including air pollutants (NO, NO2, NOX, O3, PM2.5, SO, and SO2) and meteorological features (wind speed, wind direction, and air temperature) in Istanbul metropolitan. Deep learning algorithms have many hyperparameters such as learning and dropout rate, the number of hidden layers and units in each hidden layer, activation function, loss function, and optimizer that need to be optimized in order to achieve optimal training performance. Therefore, a genetic algorithm-based hyperparameter optimization approach is proposed to find the best parameter combination. The prediction results of deep learning algorithms are compared with default hyperparameters and random search algorithms to confirm the efficacy of the genetic algorithm approach. The proposed method outperforms the other configurations, with the MSE error reduced by 13.38% and 55.30% for testing performance, respectively. The experimental results revealed that genetic algorithms are promising and applicable in hyperparameter optimization of deep neural network models, especially in air quality forecasting. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.",International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,10.1007/s13762-023-04763-6,12,12,Yes,"RNN,LSTM,GRU",,No,Turkey,Prediction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stratospheric ozone protects human beings, but high near-surface ozone concentrations threaten environment and human health. Owing to the uneven distribution of ground-monitoring stations and the low time resolution of polar orbiting satellites, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the refinement and synergistic pollution of near-surface ozone in China. Besides, atmospheric circulation patterns also affect ozone concentrations greatly. In this study, a new generation of geostationary satellite is used to estimate the hourly near-surface ozone concentration with a spatial resolution of 0.05°. First, the Pearson correlation coefficient and maximum information coefficient were used to study the correlation between the top of atmospheric radiation (TOAR) of Himawari-8 satellite and O3 concentration; seven TOAR channels were selected. Second, based on an interpretable deep learning model, the hourly ozone concentration in China from September 2015 to August 2021 was obtained using the TOAR-O3 model. Finally, the self-organizing map method was used to determine six major summer weather circulation patterns in China. The results showed that (1) the near-surface O3 concentration can be accurately estimated; the R2 (RMSE: μg/m3) values of the daily, monthly, and annual tenfold cross validation results were 0.91 (12.74), 0.97 (5.64), and 0.98 (1.75), respectively. The feature importance of the model showed that the temperature, TOAR, and boundary layer height contributed 38 %, 22 %, and 13 %, respectively. (2) The O3 concentration showed obvious spatiotemporal difference and gradually increased from 10:00 to 15:00 (Beijing time) every day. In most areas of China, O3 concentration had increased significantly. (3) The O3 concentration in northern China was the highest under the circulation pattern of the Meiyu front over the Yangtze River Delta, while in southern China, it was the highest under the circulation pattern of the northeast cold vortex controlling most of China. © 2022",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160928,12,12,Yes,DF,,Yes,China,Estimation of spatial near surface concentrations,O3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the intensity varies across regions and countries. Therefore, local studies are essential to accurately assess the correlation of climate change and ozone concentration in different countries. This study investigates the effects of climatic variables on ozone concentration in Malaysia in order to understand the nexus between climate change and ozone concentration. The selected data was obtained from ten (10) air monitoring stations strategically mounted in urban-industrial and residential areas with significant emissions of pollutants. Correlation analysis and four machine learning algorithms (random forest, decision tree regression, linear regression, and support vector regression) were used to analyze ozone and meteorological dataset in the study area. The analysis was carried out during the southwest monsoon due to the rise of ozone in the dry season. The results show a very strong correlation between temperature and ozone. Wind speed also exhibits a moderate to strong correlation with ozone, while relative humidity is negatively correlated. The highest correlation values were obtained at Bukit Rambai, Nilai, Jaya II Perai, Ipoh, Klang and Petaling Jaya. These locations have high industries and are well urbanized. The four machine learning algorithms exhibit high predictive performances, generally ascertaining the predictive accuracy of the climatic variables. The random forest outperformed other algorithms with a very high R2 of 0.970, low RMSE of 2.737 and MAE of 1.824, followed by linear regression, support vector regression and decision tree regression, respectively. This study's outcome indicates a linkage between temperature and wind speed with ozone concentration in the study area. An increase of these variables will likely increase the ozone concentration posing threats to lives and the environment. Therefore, this study provides data-driven insights for decision-makers and other stakeholders in ensuring good air quality for sustainable cities and communities. It also serves as a guide for the government for necessary climate actions to reduce the effect of climate change on air pollution and enabling sustainable cities in accordance with the UN's SDGs 13 and 11, respectively.

Considering the strong spatial correlation of air pollutants, this study focuses on the spatial prediction of AQI and proposes a novel hybrid model combining decomposition, three-stage feature selection, and boosted extreme learning machine. The spatiotemporal features are gradually extracted in three stages, including spatial correlation analysis, mutuality, and binary grey wolf optimization (BGWO). Moreover, decomposition and ensemble methods are adopted to further enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model. Based on maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT), the original AQI series in target site is decomposed into eight subseries with different frequency bands to reduce the non-stationarity of time series. Outlier robust extreme learning machine (ORELM) serves as base predictor, and the adaptive boosting. MRT (Adabost.MRT) is adopted to combine several ORELMs to generate more robust forecasts. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed model, data collected from 1497 air quality monitoring sites in China are used, and six sites are randomly selected as prediction targets. The proposed model is compared with several baseline models and existing models. The results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperforms other models in all target sites.

The data-driven forecasting model can help a better understanding of environmental air quality. The existing data-driven forecasting models usually ignore missing values, the correlations between the pollutant and meteorological factors and fail to perform temporal modeling effectively, affecting prediction accuracy. In response to these issues, we present a deep learning-based Convolutional LSTMÂSDAE (CLS) model to forecast the particulate matter level, revealing the correlation between particulate matter and meteorological factors. In the proposed architecture, the k nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation technique is employed to recover the air quality dataset's missing values.

To address this problem, in the last few years, substantial research efforts have been placed in developing statistical methods or machine learning techniques to generate estimates of air pollution at fine spatial and temporal scales (daily, usually) with complete coverage. However, it is not clear how much the predicted exposures yielded by the various methods differ, and which method generates more reliable estimates. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by evaluating a variety of exposure modeling approaches, comparing their predictive performance. Using PM2.5 in year 2011 over the continental U.S. as a case study, we generate national maps of ambient PM2.5 concentration using: (i) ordinary least squares and inverse distance weighting; (ii) kriging; (iii) statistical downscaling models, that is, spatial statistical models that use the information contained in air quality model outputs; (iv) land use regression, that is, linear regression modeling approaches that leverage the information in Geographical Information System (GIS) covariates; and (v) machine learning methods, such as neural networks, random forests and support vector regression. We examine the various methodsÂ predictive performance via cross-validation using Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Deviation, Pearson correlation, and Mean Spatial Pearson Correlation. Additionally, we evaluated whether factors such as, season, urbanicity, and levels of PM2.5 concentration (low, medium or high) affected the performance of the different methods. Overall, statistical methods that explicitly modeled the spatial correlation, e.g. universal kriging and the downscaler model, outperform all the other exposure assessment approaches regardless of season, urbanicity and PM2.5 concentration level. We posit that the better predictive performance of spatial statistical models over machine learning methods is due to the fact that they explicitly account for spatial dependence, thus borrowing information from neighboring observations. In light of our findings, we suggest that future exposure assessment methods for regional PM2.5 incorporate information from neighboring sites when deriving predictions at unsampled locations or attempt to account for spatial dependence.

This is particularly challenging for California, which has high variability in natural (e.g, wildfires, dust) and anthropogenic emissions, meteorology, topography (e.g. desert surfaces, mountains, snow cover) and land use. Methods: Using ensemble-based deep learning with big data fused from multiple sources we developed a PM2.5 prediction model with uncertainty estimates at a high spatial (1 km Ã 1 km) and temporal (weekly) resolution for a 10-year time span (2008Â2017). We leveraged autoencoder-based full residual deep networks to model complex nonlinear interrelationships among PM2.5 emission, transport and dispersion factors and other influential features. These included remote sensing data (MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD), normalized difference vegetation index, impervious surface), MERRA-2 GMI Replay Simulation (M2GMI) output, wildfire smoke plume dispersion, meteorology, land cover, traffic, elevation, and spatiotemporal trends (geo-coordinates, temporal basis functions, time index). As one of the primary predictors of interest with substantial missing data in California related to bright surfaces, cloud cover and other known interferences, missing MAIAC AOD observations were imputed and adjusted for relative humidity and vertical distribution. Wildfire smoke contribution to PM2.5 was also calculated through HYSPLIT dispersion modeling of smoke emissions derived from MODIS fire radiative power using the Fire Energetics and Emissions Research version 1.0 model. Results: Ensemble deep learning to predict PM2.5 achieved an overall mean training RMSE of 1.54 ?g/m3 (R2: 0.94) and test RMSE of 2.29 ?g/m3 (R2: 0.87). The top predictors included M2GMI carbon monoxide mixing ratio in the bottom layer, temporal basis functions, spatial location, air temperature, MAIAC AOD, and PM2.5 sea salt mass concentration. In an independent test using three long-term AQS sites and one short-term non-AQS site, our model achieved a high correlation (&gt;0.8) and a low RMSE (&lt;3 ?g/m3). Statewide predictions indicated that our model can capture the spatial distribution and temporal peaks in wildfire-related PM2.5. The coefficient of variation indicated highest uncertainty over deciduous and mixed forests and open water land covers. Conclusion: Our method can be generalized to other regions, including those having a mix of major urban areas, deserts, intensive smoke events, snow cover and complex terrains, where PM2.5 has previously been challenging to predict. Prediction uncertainty estimates can also inform further model development and measurement error evaluations in exposure and health studies.

Large-scale deployment of low-cost sensors (LCS), which typically sample in real time, may enable time-resolved or real-time modeling of concentration surfaces. The aim of this study was to develop spatiotemporal models of PM2.5, NO2, and CO using an LCS network in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We modeled daily average concentrations in August 2016-December 2017 across 50 sites. Land use variables included 13 time-independent (e.g., elevation) and time-dependent (e.g., temperature) predictors. We examined two models: LUR and a machine-learning-enabled land use model (land use random forest, LURF). The LURF models outperformed LUR models, with increase in the average externally cross-validatedR2of 0.10-0.19. Using wavelet decomposition to separate short-lived events from the regional background, we also created time-decomposed LUR and LURF models. Compared to the standard model, this resulted in improvement inR2of up to 0.14. The time-decomposed models were more influenced by spatial parameters. Mapping our models across Allegheny County, we observed that time-decomposed LURF models created robust PM2.5predictions, suggesting that this approach may improve our ability to map air pollutants at high spatiotemporal resolution.

This study proposed a novel machine learning-based model (MCNN-BP) that fused multiple convolutional neural networks (MCNN) with a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for making spatiotemporal PM2.5 forecasts for the next 72 h at 74 stations covering the whole Taiwan simultaneously. Model configuration involved an ensemble of massive hourly air quality and meteorological monitoring datasets and the existing publicly-available PM2.5 simulated (forecasted) datasets from an atmospheric chemical transport (ACT) model. The proposed methodology collaboratively constructed two CNNs to mine the observed data (the past) and the forecasted data from ACT (the future) separately. The results showed that the MCNN-BP model could significantly improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal PM2.5 forecasts and substantially reduce the forecast biases of the ACT model. We demonstrated that the proposed MCNN-BP model with effective feature extraction and good denoising ability could overcome the curse of dimensionality and offer satisfactory regional long-horizon PM2.5 forecasts. Moreover, the MCNN-BP model has considerably shorter computational time (5 min) and lower computational load than the compute-intensive ACT model.

These models were used to forecast hourly ozone concentrations of the following day for all of 2017 in the city of Seoul, South Korea. To prepare the training dataset, it was referred to observed meteorology and air pollution parameters of the 2014Â2016 period. The ensemble models fuse two regression models: a low-ozone peak model and a high-ozone model. For both, extremely randomized trees and deep neural networks were used. A regularization approach was also adopted that adjusts the model toward capturing higher ozone peaks by resampling the training dataset based on the peaks. Adopting the proposed ML ensemble forecasting method over single-model ML techniques as a part of mainstream practice for air quality forecasting will be beneficial for several reasons. For one, the proposed method, which captures daily maximum ozone concentrations during the high-ozone season (AprilÂSeptember), reduces the ozone peak prediction error by 5 to 30Â ppb. In addition, compared to station-specific (independent) ML models with more frequent low-ozone values, models are trained with a uniformly distributed dataset, so they are more generalizable in nature. As a result, unlike station-specific models, they retain their accuracy (yearly IOA = 0.84Â0.89) in all stations with an IOA increment. Proposed models also make predictions several times faster, requiring only one-time training for predicting an entire station network. Based on a categorical analysis of the training dataset, an algorithm was proposed for selecting the most suitable model for each month. The ÂbestÂ model further improves the accuracy of both the ML ensemble and individual models by up to 2.4%. This study shows that the ML ensemble modeling approach is a fast, reliable, and robust technique that can benefit environmental decision-makers in urban regions.

One such critically needed solution is the prediction of health-relevant ambient ground-level air pollution concentrations. However, many challenges exist surrounding the size and representativeness of limited ground reference stations for model development, reconciling multi-source data, and interpretability of deep learning models. This research addresses these challenges by leveraging a strategically deployed, extensive low-cost sensor (LCS) network that was rigorously calibrated through an optimized neural network. A set of raster predictors with varying data quality and spatial scales was retrieved and processed, including gap-filled satellite aerosol optical depth products and airborne LiDAR-derived 3D urban form. We developed a multi-scale, attention-enhanced convolutional neural network model to reconcile the LCS measurements and multi-source predictors for estimating daily PM2.5 concentration at 30-m resolution. This model employs an advanced approach by using the geostatistical kriging method to generate a baseline pollution pattern and a multi-scale residual method to identify both regional patterns and localized events for high-frequency feature retention. We further used permutation tests to quantify the feature importance, which has rarely been done in DL applications in environmental science. Finally, we demonstrated one application of the model by investigating the air pollution inequality issue across and within various urbanization levels at the block group scale. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of geospatial AI analysis to provide actionable solutions for addressing critical environmental issues. © 2023 The Authors",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121832,11,11,Yes,CNN,,Yes,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this important source of data suffers from low temporal resolution. Recently, geostationary satellites provide AOD data in high temporal and spatial resolution. However, the feasibility of these data in PM2.5 prediction needs further study. In this paper, we analyzed the impact of AOD derived from Himawari-8 in PM2.5 predictions. Moreover, by combining wavelet, machine learning techniques, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), a novel hybrid model was proposed. The results showed that AOD missing rate over Yangtze River Delta region is the highest in Nanjing, Hefei, and Maanshan. In addition, missing rates are the lowest in winter and summer (∼80%). Moreover, we found that considering AOD, as an auxiliary variable in the model, could not improve the accuracy of PM2.5 predictions, and in some cases decreased it slightly. In comparison with other models, our proposed hybrid model showed higher prediction accuracy, R2 is improved by 11.64% on average, and root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error is reduced by 26.82%, 27.24%, and 29.88% respectively. This research provides a general overview of the availability of Himawari-8 AOD data and its feasibility in PM2.5 predictions.

Accurate PM2.5 predictions are significant to environmental management and human health. Recently, deep learning has received increasing attention from relevant researchers. In this work, a spatiotemporal causal convolutional neural network (ST-CausalConvNet) for short-term PM2.5 prediction is proposed. The distinguishing characteristics of the proposed model is that the convolutions in the model architecture are causal, where an output at a certain time step is convolved only with elements from the same or earlier time steps in the previous layer. Accordingly, no information leakage is induced from the future to the past in this model. The spatial dependence between multiple monitoring stations was also considered in the model. Spatiotemporal correlation analysis was performed to select relevant information from monitoring stations that have a high relationship with the target station. The information from the target and related stations were then employed as the inputs and fed into the model. A case study from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2015 in Beijing, China was conducted. The next hour PM2.5 concentration was predicted by the proposed model by using historical air quality and meteorological data from 36 monitoring stations. Experimental results show that the trends of the predicted PM2.5 concentrations and the observed values were consistent. The proposed method achieved a better prediction performance than the other three comparative models, namely artificial neural network (ANN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Furthermore, the effects of the important parameters and the model transferability were also conducted. We conclude that the proposed ST-CausalConvNet is a potential effective model for air pollution forecasting.

Effective prediction models can help reduce the adverse effects of air pollutants. Accurate predictions of air pollutant concentration can provide a scientific basis for air pollution prevention and control. However, the previous air pollution-related prediction models mainly processed air quality prediction, or the prediction of a single or two air pollutants. Meanwhile, the temporal and spatial characteristics and multiple factors of pollutants were not fully considered. Herein, we establish a deep learning model for an atmospheric pollutant memory network (LSTM) by both applying the one-dimensional multi-scale convolution kernel (ODMSCNN) and a long-short-term memory network (LSTM) on the basis of temporal and spatial characteristics. The temporal and spatial characteristics combine the respective advantages of CNN and LSTM networks. First, ODMSCNN is utilized to extract the temporal and spatial characteristics of air pollutant-related data to form a feature vector, and then the feature vector is input into the LSTM network to predict the concentration of air pollutants. The data set comes from the daily concentration data and hourly concentration data of six atmospheric pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, SO2 ) and 17 types of meteorological data in XiÂan. Daily concentration data prediction, hourly concentration data prediction, group data prediction and multi-factor prediction were used to verify the effectiveness of the model.

Current studies in China at the national scale were less focused on NO2 exposure and consequent health effects than fine particulate exposure, mainly due to a lack of high-quality exposure models for accurate NO2 predictions over a long period. We developed an advanced modeling framework that incorporated multisource, high-quality predictor data (e.g., satellite observations [Ozone Monitoring Instrument NO2, TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument NO2, and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction aerosol optical depth], chemical transport model simulations, high-resolution geographical variables) and three independent machine learning algorithms into an ensemble model. The model contains three stages: (1) filling missing satellite data; (2) building an ensemble model and predicting daily NO2 concentrations from 2013 to 2019 across China at 1Ã1 km2 resolution; (3) downscaling the predictions to finer resolution (100 m) at the urban scale. Our model achieves a high performance in terms of cross-validation to assess the agreement of the overall (R2 = 0.72) and the spatial (R2 = 0.85) variations of the NO2 predictions over the observations. The model performance remains moderately good when the predictions are extrapolated to the previous years without any monitoring data (CV R2 &gt; 0.68) or regions far away from monitors (CV R2 &gt; 0.63). We identified a clear decreasing trend of NO2 exposure from 2013 to 2019 across the country with the largest reduction in suburban and rural areas. Our downscaled model further improved the prediction ability by 4%Â14% in some megacities and captured substantial NO2 variations within 1-km grids in the urban areas, especially near major roads. Our model provides flexibility at both temporal and spatial scales and can be applied to exposure assessment and epidemiological studies with various study domains (e.g., national or citywide) and settings (e.g., long-term and short-term).

Since 2012, they have been added to the pollutant list for national monitoring in Wuhan. However, the fine-scale variation in pollution, especially at the street level, is complex and requires further exploration. In this study, the influence of urban form on the street-level air pollution distribution was comprehensively assessed according to the urban factors, high-resolution meteorological data, PM2.5 and CO concentration data collected via mobile monitoring along roads in Wuhan. Furthermore, potential urban factors, including the land-use and urban form characteristics, were obtained from geographic information system. Both linear regression and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models were developed to explore the relationship between the observed concentrations and the predictor variables. The modeling results demonstrate that the GBDT model, which captured the non-linear relationship, helps to better explain more of the variations in the pollutant concentrations than the linear model. This study provides insights into machine learning models for pollution prediction and demonstrate the important relationship between urban form and street-level pollutants. The results suggest that the urban form of the podium-level porosity can be set higher than 0.7 to promote the ventilation of street-level PM2.5 and CO, building density can be less than 0.35, and the standard deviation of height can be set to ~10 m in central Wuhan to mitigate street-level PM2.5.

This study proposes a three-stage hybrid neural network model to forecast outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. It subsumes outlier correction, decomposition, neural network, and metaheuristic optimization to guarantee high accuracy. The adopted methods serve different purposes and ultimately aim at improving the performance of model. Firstly, a robust outlier correction preprocessing method is employed to filter the abnormal information in the original PM2.5 concentrations series and reduce its complexity. Then, the processed series is adaptively decomposed into several subseries by empirical wavelet transform. The subseries are more stationary and their trends are more obvious than original series. To forecast each subseries and generate multi-step forecasting outputs, weighted regularized extreme learning machine whose parameters are optimally determined by neural network algorithm is used. Finally, inverse empirical wavelet transform is implemented to reconstruct the subseries and correct unexpected forecasting values beyond the frequency bands. The proposed model is tested by the actual data collected from four cities in China. Results demonstrate that: (1) the proposed model has accurate forecasting performance, whose root mean square errors of 5-step daily forecasting results in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan are 4.7555?g/m3, 3.3024?g/m3, 6.4326?g/m3, and 4.3191?g/m3, respectively; (2) all components of the hybrid model are indispensable to promote accuracy; (3) the proposed model significantly outperforms seven benchmark models and five existing models; (4) the forecasting results can be utilized to analyze the trend of pollution and perform better management measures.

For this purpose, multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLFFNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) have been applied. The air pollutants, e.g., CO, Ozone, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, SO2, benzene, toluene, as well as meteorological parameters (temperature, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, evaporation, humidity, pressure, etc.), have been used as inputs in the present study. Moreover, this is one of the first papers that employ aerodynamic roughness coefficient as an input parameter for the prediction of PM2.5 concentration. The result of the study shows that the LSTM model with index of agreement (IA) 0.986, root mean square error (RMSE) 21.510, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency index (NSE) 0.945, (coefficient of determination)R2 0.945, and (correlation coefficient)R 0.972 is the best performing technique for the prediction of PM2.5 followed by MLFFNN, SVM, and RF models. The sensitivity analysis for the LSTM model reported that PM10, wind speed, NH3, and benzene are the key influencing parameters for the estimation of PM2.5. The findings in this work suggest that the LSTM could advance in PM2.5 forecasting and thus would be useful for developing fine-scale, state-of-the-art air pollution forecasting models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,10.1007/s10661-022-10603-w,10,10,Yes,"SVM,RF,LSTM,ANN",,No,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing O3 datasets with coarse spatiotemporal resolution and limited coverage, and the un-certainties of O3 influential factors seriously restrain related epidemiology and air pollution studies. To tackle above issues, we proposed a novel scheme to estimate daily O3 concentrations on a fine grid scale (1 km x 1 km) from 2018 to 2020 across China based on machine learning methods using hourly observed ground-level pollutant concentrations data, meteorological data, satellite data, and auxiliary data including digital eleva-tion model (DEM), land use data (LUD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population (POP), and nighttime light images (NTL), and to identify the difference of influential factors of O3 on diverse urbanization and topography conditions. Some findings were achieved. The correlation coefficients (R2) between O3 con-centrations and surface net solar radiation (SNSR), boundary layer height (BLH), 2 m temperature (T2M), 10 m v -component (MVW), and NDVI were 0.80, 0.40, 0.35, 0.30, and 0.20, respectively. The random forest (RF) demonstrated the highest validation R2 (0.86) and lowest validation RMSE (13.74 mu g/m3) in estimating O3 concentrations, followed by support vector machine (SVM) (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 18.39 mu g/m3), backpropagation neural network (BP) (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 19.26 mu g/m3), and multiple linear regression (MLR) (R2 = 0.52, RMSE = 25.99 mu g/m3). Our China High-Resolution O3 Dataset (CHROD) exhibited an acceptable accuracy at different spatial-temporal scales. Additionally, O3 concentrations showed decreasing trend and represented obviously spatiotemporal heterogeneity across China from 2018 to 2020. Overall, O3 was mainly affected by human ac-tivities in higher urbanization regions, while O3 was mainly controlled by meteorological factors, vegetation coverage, and elevation in lower urbanization regions.

This study proposes a domain-specific Bayesian deep-learning model for long-term air pollution forecast in China and the United Kingdom. Our proposed model carries three novelties: First, a domain-specific knowledge is integrated to take into account the strong statistical relationship between PM 2.5 and PM 10 as a regularization term; Second, an attention layer is included to capture the influential historical feature and the recursive temporal correlation of air quality data; Third, results generated from different multi-step forecast strategies are combined based on corresponding uncertainty measures to improve our model's performance. Our model outperforms other baseline models. Results show that incorporating Bayesian and domain-specific knowledge into the deep learning model can reduce the prediction errors by a maximum of 3.7% and 12.4%, for Beijing and London, respectively. Specifically, incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the Bayesian deep-learning model reduces prediction errors whilst the integration of Bayesian techniques allows the fusion of different forecast strategies to improve prediction accuracy.

However, statistical-based models oversimplify the AOD-PM2.5 relationships, whereas complex machine learning technologies ignore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the predictors and demonstrate shortage in interpretation. Besides, large AOD data gaps resulting in PM2.5 estimation biases have been seldom imputed in previous studies, especially at national scales. To fill the above research gaps, this study attempts to present a feasible methodology to estimate daily spatially-continuous PM2.5 concentrations in China. The AOD data gaps across China were first imputed via a random forest (RF) model. Then, an interpretable self-adaptive deep neural network (SADNN) model, incorporating AOD, meteorological and other auxiliary predictors, was developed to estimate daily spatially-continuous PM2.5 concentrations from 2017 to 2018. Five-fold sample (site)-based cross-validation results showed a high accuracy of the SADNN model, with coefficient of determination and root mean square error values equal to 0.86 (0.84) and 13.07 (14.30) ?g/m3, respectively, outperforming the standard DNN and the RF model. Furthermore, the SADNN model identified the spatiotemporal patterns of predictor importance, and demonstrated that the boundary layer height, elevation and AOD were the most important predictors both spatially and temporally. And the predictor importance in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was different from that in the rest of China. These results enhance our understanding of AOD-PM2.5 relationships and elucidate the estimated PM2.5 datasets with complete coverage are applicable for related air pollution studies and epidemiological cohort studies. Moreover, considering the effective nonlinear model capability and interpretability, the SADNN model is beneficial for not only PM2.5 estimation but also other earth data and scenarios.

Data from satellites, reanalysis, and chemical transport models offer additional information used to reconstruct pollution concentrations at high spatio-temporal resolutions. This study aims to develop a multi-stage satellite-based machine learning model to estimate daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels across Great Britain between 2008Â2018. This high-resolution model consists of random forest (RF) algorithms applied in four stages. Stage-1 augments monitor-PM2.5 series using co-located PM10 measures. Stage-2 imputes missing satellite aerosol optical depth observations using atmospheric reanalysis models. Stage-3 integrates the output from previous stages with spatial and spatio-temporal variables to build a prediction model for PM2.5 . Stage-4 applies Stage-3 models to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations over a 1 km grid. The RF architecture performed well in all stages, with results from Stage-3 showing an average cross-validated R2 of 0.767 and minimal bias. The model performed better over the temporal scale when compared to the spatial component, but both presented good accuracy with an R2 of 0.795 and 0.658, respectively. These findings indicate that direct satellite observations must be integrated with other satellite-based products and geospatial variables to derive reliable estimates of air pollution exposure. The high spatio-temporal resolution and the relatively high precision allow these estimates (approximately 950 million points) to be used in epidemiological analyses to assess health risks associated with both short-and long-term exposure to PM2.5 .

Numerous studies have demonstrated that data-driven spatio-temporal prediction models of PM2.5 concentration are comparable with the model-driven model. However, data-driven models are usually depending on the statistical correlation between PM2.5 and other factors and have challenges in dealing with causality in complex systems. In this paper, we argue that domain knowledge should be incorporated into data-driven models to enhance prediction accuracy and make the model more physically realistic. We focus on the influence of dynamic wind-field on PM2.5 concentration distribution and fuse the pollution diffusion distance with the deep learning model based on a wind-field surface. In order to model spatial dependence between monitoring stations, which is dynamic and anisotropic because of the wind-field, we proposed a hybrid deep learning framework, dynamic directed spatio-temporal graph convolution networks (DD-STGCN). It expanded the ability to deal with space-time prediction in the continuous and dynamic wind-field. We used a directed graph time-series to describe the vertex state and topological relationship between vertices and replaced traditional Euclidean distance with wind-field diffusion distance to describe the proximity relationship between vertices. Our experiment results demonstrated that the DD-STGCN model achieved a better prediction ability than LSTM, GC-LSTM, and STGCN models. Compared to the best comparison model, MAPE, MAE, and RMSE were improved by 10.2%, 9.7%, and 9.6% in 12 h on an average, respectively. The performance of our model was further tested during a haze period. In the case that two models both considered the effect of wind, compared with the pure data-driven model, our model performed better in prediction distribution and showed the benefit of spatial interpretability provided by domain knowledge.

To obtain the spatial distributions of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an in summer and develop a simultaneous control strategy of ozone and urban heat island, the land use regression model is modified and improved using the machine learning random forest algorithm. The LUR-Kriging-RF integrated prediction model is then established. The land use regression and kriging are used to extract the feature variables, while random forest is used to establish a regression model. The spatial distribution maps of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an are obtained by regression mapping of the prediction model, and the spatial relationships between them are analyzed. The SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) and partial dependence plot (PDP) are adopted to explain the way feature variables act on ozone and urban heat island. Based on the spatial distribution and interaction mode, a simultaneous control strategy of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an is put forward. For ozone, the R2 of the integrated prediction model (0.65) is higher than that of land use regression (0.4), while the RMSE (28.18) of the integrated model is lower than that of land use regression (35.66). For temperature, the R2 of the integrated model (0.93) is higher than that of land use regression (0.8), while its RMSE (0.92) is lower than that of land use regression (1.52). The performance of the LUR-Kriging-RF integrated prediction model is better than that of land use regression. This study reveals the spatial interactions between ozone and land use regression in the central urban areas. The suitable strategies for mapping ozone pollution and urban heat island control include reducing VOCs emissions from industrial sources and agricultural sources, increasing plants with low VOCs emissions, and spray humidification. This study can be used to evaluate ozone exposure and thermal exposure, provide scientific support for environmental protection and urban heat island control policies, contribute to reducing public health threats, promote the sustainability of urban environments, and promote the practical application of machine learning in this field.

This is generally due to a lack of air quality monitoring networks in the region. Low cost air quality sensors developed locally in sub-Saharan Africa presents a sustainable operating mechanism that may help generate the air monitoring data needed for exposure estimation of air pollution with LUR models. The primary objective of our study is to investigate whether a network of locally developed low-cost air quality sensors can be used in LUR modeling for accurately predicting monthly ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution in urban areas of central and eastern Uganda. Secondarily, we aimed to explore whether the application of machine learning (ML) can improve LUR predictions compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We used data for the entire year of 2020 from a network of 23 PM2.5 low-cost sensors located in urban municipalities of eastern and central Uganda. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, these sensors collected highly time-resolved measurement data of PM2.5 air concentrations. We used monthly-averaged PM2.5 concentration data for LUR prediction modeling of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. We used eight different ML base-learner algorithms as well as ensemble modeling. We applied 5-fold cross validation (80% training/20% test random splits) to evaluate the models with resampling and Root mean squared error (RMSE). The relative explanatory power and accuracy of the ML algorithms were evaluated by comparing coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE, using OLS as the reference approach. The overall average PM2.5 concentration during the study period was 52.22 ?g/m3 (IQR: 38.11, 62.84 ?g/m3)Âwell above World Health Organization PM2.5 ambient air guidelines. From the base-learner and ensemble models, RMSE and R2 values ranged between 7.65 ?g/m3 Â 16.85 ?g/m3 and 0.24Â0.84, respectively. Extreme gradient boosting (xgbTree) performed best out of the base learner algorithms (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 7.65 ?g/m3). Model performance from ensemble modeling with Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models (glmnet) did not outperform xgbTree, but prediction performance was comparable to that of xgbTree. The most important temporal and spatial predictors of monthly PM2.5 levels were monthly precipitation, percent of the population using solid fuels for cooking, distance to Lake Victoria, and greenspace (NDVI) within a 500-m buffer of air monitors. In conclusion, data from locally developed low-cost PM sensors provide evidence that they can be used for spatio-temporal prediction modeling of air pollution exposures in Uganda. Moreover, the non-parametric ML and ensemble approaches to LUR modeling clearly outperformed OLS regression algorithm for the prediction of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. Deploying low-cost air quality sensors in concert with implementation of data quality control measures, can help address the critical need for expanding and improving air quality monitoring in resource-constrained settings of sub-Saharan Africa. These low-cost sensors, in conjunction with non-parametric ML algorithms, may provide a rapid path forward for PM2.5 exposure assessment and to spur air pollution epidemiology research in the region.

Deep learning methods based on time series have been highly accurate in predicting PM2.5. However, most time series models lack the ability for spatial generalization because they cannot combine the analysis at different spatial scales. In addition, temporal long-term trend analysis have not been reported in most of the studies. In this study, to reveal the spatiotemporal variability and trends of PM2.5, an improved deep learning framework named the SpatioTemporal Enhanced Neural Network (STENN) is developed for estimating PM2.5 concentrations with a spatial resolution of 1 km. Based on the bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) structure and attention mechanisms, the model provides a geographic-data-driven approach to incorporate the impact of the spatial heterogeneity and time dependence of PM2.5, which demonstrates that it has robust spatiotemporal transferable power with an R2 of 0.89 produced by cross validation (CV). High-resolution (1 km) and high-quality annual PM2.5 products for mainland China from 2014 to 2020 were constructed. In comparison with the current 1-km PM2.5 products, our framework demonstrates better stability in different regions, especially in terms of the high-value estimations and spatial continuity. The spatiotemporal PM2.5 distributions were also analyzed based on the time-series products. After the implementation of various control policies for atmospheric pollution, a declining trend of PM2.5 concentrations was observed in 88.79% of China between 2014 and 2020, with a mean decrease rate of 3.35 ?g m?3 yr?1. This result indicates that the control policies of the Chinese government were effective in reducing PM2.5 concentrations. The PM2.5 concentrations in China reveal an exponential temporal trend, from a rapid decline to a gradual slowdown and a stable phase. To realize the vision of the Beautiful China Initiative, a regionally targeted policy for air pollution management is required. This study provides valuable implications for a more detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal variations in PM2.5 at small and medium spatial scales by developing an improved deep learning approach with a spatial generalization ability and integration with multi-temporal satellite products.

A critical step for the time-series forecasting is the right determination of the number of past observations (lags). This paper investigates the forecasting accuracy based on the selection of an appropriate time-lag value by applying a comparative study between three methods. These methods include a statistical approach using auto correlation function, a well-known machine learning technique namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) along with a heuristic algorithm to optimize the choosing of time-lag value, and a parallel implementation of LSTM that dynamically choose the best prediction based on the optimal time-lag value. The methods were applied to an experimental data set, which consists of five meteorological parameters and aerosol particle number concentration. The performance metrics were: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and R-squared. The investigation demonstrated that the proposed LSTM model with heuristic algorithm is the superior method in identifying the best time-lag value. Â© 2021 by the authors.

PM2.5 concentrations are associated with various spatiotemporal factors, which makes the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations still a challenging task. One of the reasons that makes the accurate prediction by statistical learning method difficult is severe fluctuations in input data. In addition, the abstraction method of space will also affect the prediction results. To address these important issues, a novel hybrid decomposing-ensemble and spatiotemporal attention (DESA) model is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy by decomposing the mode-mixed time series into single-mode series and automatically assign weights to the spatiotemporal factors. In our proposed framework, raw PM2.5 series are firstly decomposed into simple sub-series via the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) method. Then, to keep the results independent of the spatial abstraction method, a data-driven approach called multiscale spatiotemporal attention network is employed to extract spatiotemporal features from the sub-series. Finally, the predictions of each sub-series are processed separately and combined to obtain the final prediction results. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieved the better performance with RMSE of 11.15, 17.49, 24.84, and 26.93 for 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-h forecasting, respectively. The proposed method is expected to be applied in fine prediction of air pollution and controlling programs and therefore provide decision support or useful guidance.

This paper reports on research to model an early warning tool for coarse particulates when assessing the impact of the 12 satellite-derived and ground-based meteorological pollutants out of 30 pollutants considered using hourly Australian data from January 2018ÂDecember 2020. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was integrated with a one-directional fully gated recurrent unit (GRU) to forecast consecutive hours' air quality. The CNN model acts as a spatial feature extractor, whereas the new generation GRU makes it computationally efficient. The resultant hybrid ÂCNN-GRUÂ is then comprehensively benchmarked outperforming an ensemble of six other deep learning models. The proposed model's efficacy is indicated at the four most air polluted Australian postcodes in the testing phase.

The air pollution forecast can provide important information to all affected sides, and allows appropriate measures to be taken. In order to address the problems of filling in the missing values in the time series used for air pollution forecasts, the automation of the allocation of optimal subset of input variables, the dependency of the air quality at a particular location on the conditions of the surrounding environment, as well as automation of the modelÂs optimization, this paper proposes a deep spatiotemporal model based on a 2D convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network for predicting air pollution. The model utilizes the automatic selection of input variables and the optimization of hyperparameters by a genetic algorithm. A hybrid strategy for missing value imputation is used based on a combination of linear interpolation and a strategy of using the average between the previous value and the average value for the same time in other years. In order to determine the best architecture of the spatiotemporal model, the architecture hyperparameters are optimized by a genetic algorithm with a modified crossover operator for solutions with variable lengths. Additionally, the trained models are included in various ensembles in order to further improve the prediction performanceÂthese include ensembles of models with the same architecture comprising the best architecture obtained by the evolutionary optimization, and ensembles of diverse models comprising the k best models of the evolutionary optimization. The experimental results for the Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data Set show that the proposed spatiotemporal model for air pollution forecasting provides good and consistent prediction results. The comparison of the suggested model with other deep NN models shows satisfactory results, with the best performance according to MAE, based on the experimental results for the station at Wanliu (16.753 Â± 0.384). Most of the model architectures obtained by the optimization of the model hyperparameters using the genetic algorithm have one convolutional layer with a small number of kernels and a small kernel size; the convolutional layers are followed by a max-pooling layer, and one or two LSTM layers are utilized with dropout regularization applied to the LSTM layer using small values of p (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3). The utilization of ensembles from the k best trained models further improves the prediction results and surpasses other deep learning models, according to MAE and RMSE metrics. The used hybrid strategy for missing value imputation enhances the results, especially for data with clear seasonality, and produces better MAE compared to the strategy using average values for the same hour of the same day and month in other years. The experimental results also reveal that random searching is a simple and effective strategy for selecting the input variables. Furthermore, the inclusion of spatial information in the modelÂs input data, based on the local neighborhood data, significantly improves the predictive results obtained with the model. The results obtained demonstrate the benefits of including spatial information from as many surrounding stations as possible, as well as using as much historical information as possible.

Potential predictors included satellite retrievals, chemical transport model estimates and land-use variables. Supervised linear regression (SLR) was used to select predictors, and then GWR estimated the potentially spatially-varying coefficients. We developed multi-year models using geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR). Five-fold cross-validation per year showed that GWR and GTWR explained similar spatial variations in annual average concentrations (average R2 = NO2: 0.66; O3: 0.58; PM10: 0.62; PM2.5: 0.77), which are better than SLR (average R2 = NO2: 0.61; O3: 0.46; PM10: 0.51; PM2.5: 0.75) and RF (average R2 = NO2: 0.64; O3: 0.53; PM10: 0.56; PM2.5: 0.67).

Historical long-term PM2.5 records with high temporal resolution are essential but lacking for both research and environmental management. Here, we reconstruct a site-based PM2.5 dataset at 6 h intervals from 1960 to 2020 that combines long-term visibility, conventional meteorological observations, emissions, and elevation. The PM2.5 concentration at each site is estimated based on an advanced machine learning model, LightGBM, that takes advantage of spatial features from 20 surrounding meteorological stations. Our model's performance is comparable to or even better than those of previous studies in by-year cross validation (CV) (R-2 = 0.7) and spatial CV (R-2 = 0.76) and is more advantageous in long-term records and high temporal resolution.

Accurate estimation of PM2.5 concentrations can timely assist relevant agencies to conduct air pollution treatment and provide essential data sources for epidemiological research related to PM2.5 exposure. Although China has established a network for monitoring ground-level PM2.5 concentrations over the past decades, the limited available records from the sparsely located PM2.5 monitoring sites hinder the fine-resolution research of air pollution. Many studies have been conducted to fill the data gap caused by sparsely distributed monitoring sites, but the accuracy of different models varies greatly. In recent years, machine learning models have become the preferred choices due to their high estimation accuracy. However, the estimation accuracy may differ significantly in different study areas with different models, and there are few studies on model performance evaluation regarding the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. This study evaluated the performance of six machine learning models for estimating PM2.5 concentrations in PRD from August 2014 to December 2019. Moreover, multi-source data were adopted for reliable daily PM2.5 concentration estimation, including meteorology, vegetation, topography, and point of interest (POI).

Therefore, improving air pollution forecasts from wildfires is essential and informing citizens of more frequent, accurate, and interpretable updates related to localized air pollution events. This research proposes a multi-head attention-based deep learning architecture, SpatioTemporal (ST)-Transformer, to improve spatiotemporal predictions of PM2.5 concentrations in wildfire-prone areas. The ST-Transformer model employed a sparse attention mechanism that concentrates on the most useful contextual information across spatial, temporal, and variable-wise dimensions. The model includes critical driving factors of PM2.5 concentrations as predicting factors, including wildfire perimeter and intensity, meteorological factors, road traffic, PM2.5, and temporal indicators from the past 24 h. The model is trained to conduct time series forecasting on PM2.5 concentrations at EPA's air quality stations in the greater Los Angeles area. Prediction results were compared with other existing time series forecasting methods and exhibited better performance, especially in capturing abrupt changes or spikes in PM2.5 concentrations during wildfire situations. The attention matrix learned by the proposed model enabled interpretation of the complex spatial, temporal, and variable-wise dependencies, indicating that the model can differentiate between wildfires and non-wildfires. The ST-Transformer model's accurate predictability and interpretation capacity can help effectively monitor and predict the impacts of wildfire smoke and be applicable to other complex spatiotemporal prediction problems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160446,9,9,Yes,STT,,Yes,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among all the particulate matter of air pollution, PM2.5 (whose aerodynamic diameter is 2.5Â ?m or less) is of particular concern. Long-term exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5 can negatively affect human health. The negative effects of PM2.5 make forecast its concentration an urgent need. In this paper, we propose a novel Factory-aware Attentional LSTM Model (FAA-LSTM) for PM2.5 air pollution predictions. The proposed model collects air pollution data from both the monitor stations and micro air quality sensors, in which a spatial transformation is designed to obtain the local area data of PM2.5 grids. Next, a novel factory-aware attention mechanism over a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is proposed to extract the hidden features of industrial factors and derive their factory attention weights on the influences of PM2.5 concentrations. The influence of neighboring factory data over local PM2.5 grids can be weighted to discover the importance of PM2.5 concentrations of neighboring areas. Moreover, the model combines these heterogeneous data and the global station data to forecast PM2.5 concentrations. The experimentÂs evaluation is conducted using both air pollution data and industrial data. The results show that the factory-aware attention mechanism helps to improve the prediction performance by exploring the effect of the factory distribution on PM2.5 pollutants in the local areas. While monitoring stations have been established to collect air quality information and forecast air quality, few studies have taken the different monitoring areas and industrial features into account. The proposed novel model considering PM2.5 concentrations from local neighboring areas and global station, and industrial data as features can effectively indicate the impact of PM2.5 pollution with industrial emissions and spatial relationships.

The LTX model performed well with R2 = 0.88, RMSE of 8.73 ?g/m3 and MAE of 5.85 ?g/m3. Our findings suggest that integrated three-dimensional landscape pattern information and XGBOOST approaches can accurately estimate annual and seasonal variations of PM2.5 pollution The Guanzhong Plain and northern Shaanxi always feature high PM2.5 values, which exhibit similar distribution trends to those of the observed PM2.5 pollution. This study demonstrated the outstanding performance of the LTX model, which outperforms most models in past researches. On the whole, LTX approach is reliable and can improve the accuracy of pollutant concentration prediction. The health risks of human exposure to fine particles are relatively high in winter. Central part is a high health risk area, while northern area is low. Our study provides a new method for atmospheric pollutants assessing, which is important for LUR model optimization, high-precision PM2.5 pollution prediction and landscape pattern planning. These results can also contribute to human health exposure risks and future epidemiological studies of air pollution.

High resolution spatiotemporal estimates of such exposures are critical to assess health effects at an individual level. This article retrospectively assesses daily average PM2.5 exposure at 1 km Ã 1 km grids in Delhi, India from 2010 to 2016, using multiple data sources and ensemble averaging approaches. We used a multi-stage modeling exercise involving satellite data, land use variables, reanalysis based meteorological variables and population density. A calibration regression was used to model PM2.5: PM10 to counter the sparsity of ground monitoring data. The relationship between PM2.5 and its spatiotemporal predictors was modeled using six learners; generalized additive models, elastic net, support vector regressions, random forests, neural networks and extreme gradient boosting. Subsequently, these predictions were combined under a generalized additive model framework using a tensor product based spatial smoothing. Overall cross-validated prediction accuracy of the model was 80% over the study period with high spatial model accuracy and predicted annual average concentrations ranging from 87 to 138 ?g/m3. Annual average root mean squared errors for the ensemble averaged predictions were in the range 39.7Â62.7 ?g/m3 with prediction bias ranging between 4.6 and 11.2 ?g/m3. In addition, tree based learners such as random forests and extreme gradient boosting outperformed other algorithms. Our findings indicate important seasonal and geographical differences in particulate matter concentrations within Delhi over a significant period of time, with meteorological and land use features that discriminate most and least polluted regions. This exposure assessment can be used to estimate dose response relationships more accurately over a wide range of particulate matter concentrations.

An accurate assessment of its spatial and temporal distribution is mandatory to conduct epidemiological studies able to estimate long-term (e.g., annual) and short-term (e.g., daily) health effects. While spatiotemporal models for particulate matter (PM) have been developed in several countries, estimates of daily nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) concentrations at high spatial resolution are lacking, and no such models have been developed in Sweden. We collected data on daily air pollutant concentrations from routine monitoring networks over the period 2005-2016 and matched them with satellite data, dispersion models, meteorological parameters, and land-use variables. We developed a machine-learning approach, the random forest (RF), to estimate daily concentrations of PM10 (PM<10 microns), PM2.5 (PM<2.5 microns), PM2.5-10 (PM between 2.5 and 10 microns), NO2, and O-3 for each squared kilometer of Sweden over the period 2005-2016.

Effective Air Quality Index (AQI) forecasting can provide a reliable guarantee for pollution control and air quality warnings. In this research background, a spatial multi-resolution data-driven ensemble AQI forecasting model based on real-time decomposition is proposed. The model uses spatial correlation analysis to screen out the auxiliary sites that are most relevant to the target site. Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) decomposes the original AQI data into multiple subseries. The iterative refresh mechanism of real-time decomposition makes the decomposition method more valuable in engineering applications. The classic averaging method and deep learning-based Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) are used to obtain low-resolution data and high-resolution data, respectively. Subseries containing fluctuation information and depth features are input into Outlier Robust Extreme Learning Machine (ORELM) for forecasting. Multi-Objective Wolf Colony Algorithm (MOWCA) is utilized for the ensemble of multiple resolution predictors. Then, the high-correlation auxiliary sites tested by the Pearson method are input into the model where the target site is located. After the optimized ensemble of the new meta-heuristic bat algorithm, the final AQI forecasting result is produced. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed model, historical air quality data from 26 city monitoring stations in China is used for experimental comparison. Experimental results show that each component of the proposed model has a positive effect on the forecasting performance of the model. The proposed model has excellent forecasting performance, and its performance is superior to other comparative models. Reasonable consideration of multi-resolution and space-time data provides more ideas for the enrichment of the air pollution forecasting model library. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, it still remains a challenge due to the limited information of emission source and high uncertainties of the dynamic processes. In order to improve the accuracy of air pollutant concentration forecast, this study proposes a novel hybrid model using clustering, feature selection, real-time decomposition by empirical wavelet transform, and deep learning neural network. First, all air pollutant time series are decomposed by empirical wavelet transform based on real-time decomposition, and subsets of output data are constructed by combining corresponding decomposed components. Second, each subset of output data is classified into several clusters by clustering algorithm, and then appropriate inputs are selected by feature selection method. Third, a deep learning-based predictor, which uses three dimensional convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory neural network, is applied to predict decomposition components of each cluster. Last, air pollutant concentration forecast for each monitoring station is obtained by reconstructing predicted values of all the decomposition components. PM2.5 concentration data of Beijing, China is used to validate and test our model. Results show that the proposed model outperforms other models used in this study. In our model, mean absolute percentage error for 1, 6, 10 h ahead PM2.5 concentration prediction is 4.03%, 6.87%, and 8.98%, respectively. These outcomes demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model is a powerful tool to provide highly accurate forecast for air pollutant concentration.

At present, most remote sensing based approaches for the estimation of PM2.5 and PM10 employed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products as the main variate. Nevertheless, the coverage of missing data is generally large in AOD products, which can cause deviations in practical applications of estimated PM2.5 and PM10 (e.g., air quality monitoring and exposure evaluation). To efficiently address this issue, our study explores a novel approach using the datasets of the precursors &amp; chemical compositions for PM2.5 and PM10 instead of AOD products. Specifically, the daily full-coverage ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 are estimated at 5-km (0.05Â°) spatial girds across China based on Sentinel-5P and assimilated datasets (GEOS-FP). The estimation models are acquired via an advanced ensemble learning method named Light Gradient Boosting Machine in this paper. For comparison, the Deep Blue AOD product from VIIRS is adopted in a similar framework as a baseline (AOD-based). Validation results show that the ambient concentrations are well estimated through the proposed approach, with the space-based Cross-Validation R2s and RMSEs of 0.88 (0.83) and 11.549 (22.9) ?g/m3 for PM2.5 (PM10), respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed approach achieves better performance than the AOD-based in different cases (e.g., overall and seasonal). Compared to the related previous works over China, the estimation accuracy of our method is also satisfactory. Regarding the mapping, the estimated results through the proposed approach display consecutive spatial distribution and can exactly express the seasonal variations of PM2.5 and PM10. The proposed approach could efficiently present daily full-coverage results at 5-km spatial grids. It has a large potential to be extended for providing global accurate ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 at multiple temporal scales (e.g., daily and annual).

However, the existing ground-based PM2.5 monitoring network has sparsely-distributed sites and satellite cannot give 24-h PM2.5, which make it difficult to grasp the spatial and sub-daily variation characteristics of PM2.5. This study aims to fill that gap by establishing a virtual network of hourly PM2.5 concentration using the LightGBM model, based on the high-density ground meteorological observations at ~2400 sites across China. The virtual network shows a desirable performance of hourly PM2.5 estimation across China, with R2 of 0.86, root-mean-square error values of 14.99 ?g/m3, and mean absolute error of 9.48 ?g/m3 (the results of Cross-Validation). It also exhibits high spatial-temporal consistencies with the observed PM2.5. Spatially, the heaviest PM2.5 pollution is mainly distributed in eastern China (especially the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze and Pearl river deltas, and the Sichuan-Chongqing areas). Temporarily, PM2.5 exhibits remarkable seasonal and diurnal changes characterized by higher concentration in winter and nighttime and lower in summer and daytime. Meanwhile, we found that visibility can be used as the primary predictor in the machine learning model to enhance the accuracy of estimated PM2.5. The established virtual hourly PM2.5 network (~2400 stations) provides a more intuitive and detailed PM2.5 data for us to understand the diurnal variation of PM2.5 and monitor inter-regional transport of haze over China.

To evaluate human exposure to NO2 for public health assessment, maps of near-surface NO2 concentrations at a high resolution of 100 m are desirable. In this study, we report hourly maps of gridded near-surface NO2 concentrations that are produced using an extreme gradient-boosted tree ensemble for an Alpine domain (Switzerland and northern Italy) spanning two years, from June 2018 to May 2020. To estimate the NO2 distribution at ground level, we used satellite observations of NO2 vertical column density, land use data, meteorological fields and topographical information to train models with in situ NO2 ground measurements. The best model with this approach captured up to 59% of hourly NO2 variation for 40 test stations in the domain with a mean absolute error of 7.69?g/m3, performing especially well for urban regions with dense sampling. We present the first hourly maps of NO2 concentrations that reveal previously unresolved spatio-temporal variations. Local interpretations of the machine learning model demonstrate that TROPOMI NO2 satellite observations make a strong contribution to the information content of the near-surface NO2 maps besides their relatively coarse resolution (3.5 Ã 5.5 km2) and the fact that they are only available once a day under cloud-free conditions.

However, current PM2.5 concentration estimation, which is mainly based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological data, usually had a low spatial resolution (kilometers) and severe spatial missing problem, cannot be applied to intra-urban pollution monitoring. To solve these problems, top-of-atmosphere reflectance (TOAR), which contains both the information about land and atmosphere and has high resolution and large spatial coverage, may be efficiently used for PM2.5 estimation. This study aims to systematically evaluate the feasibility of retrieving ultrahigh-resolution PM2.5 concentration at a large scale (national level) from TOAR. Firstly, we make a detailed discussion about several important but unsolved theoretic problems on TOAR-based PM2.5 retrieval, including the band selection, scale effect, cloud impact, and mapping quality evaluation. Secondly, four types and eight retrieval models are compared in terms of quantitative accuracy, mapping quality, model generalization, and model efficiency, with the pros and cons of each type summarized.

In this study, Himawari-8 AOD, meteorological factors, geographic information, and a new deep forest model were used to construct an AOD-PM2.5 estimation model in China. Hourly cross-validation results indicated that estimated PM2.5 values were consistent with the site observation values, with an R2 range of 0.82Â0.91 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.79Â14.72 ?g/mÂ³, among which the model performance reached the optimum value between 13:00 and 15:00 Beijing time (R2 &gt; 0.9). Analysis of the correlation coefficient between important features and PM2.5 showed that the model performance was related to AOD and affected by meteorological factors, particularly the boundary layer height. Deep forest can detect diurnal variations in pollutant concentrations, which were higher in the morning, peaked at 10:00Â11:00, and then began to decline. High-resolution PM2.5 concentrations derived from the deep forest model revealed that some cities in China are seriously polluted, such as Xi Âan, Wuhan, and Chengdu. Our model can also capture the direction of PM2.5, which conforms to the wind field. The results indicated that due to the combined effect of wind and mountains, some areas in China experience PM2.5 pollution accumulation during spring and winter. We need to be vigilant because these areas with high PM2.5 concentrations typically occur near cities.

The spatiotemporal coverage provided by traditional NO2 monitoring methods is insufficient, especially in the suburban and rural areas of north China, which have a high population density and experience severe air pollution. In this study, we implemented a spatiotemporal neural network (STNN) model to estimate surface NO2 from multiple sources of information, which included satellite and in situ measurements as well as meteorological and geographical data. The STNN predicted NO2 with high accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89 and a root mean squared error of 5.8 ?g/m3 for sample-based 10-fold cross-validation. Based on the surface NO2 concentration determined by the STNN, we analyzed the spatial distribution and temporal trends of NO2 pollution in north China. We found substantial drops in surface NO2 concentrations ranging between 9.1% and 33.2% for large cities during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown when compared to those in 2019. Moreover, we estimated the all-cause deaths attributed to NO2 exposure at a high spatial resolution of about 1 km, with totals of 6082, 4200, and 18,210 for Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Provinces in 2020, respectively. We observed remarkable regional differences in the health impacts due to NO2 among urban, suburban, and rural areas. Generally, the STNN model could incorporate spatiotemporal neighboring information and infer surface NO2 concentration with full coverage and high accuracy. Compared with machine learning regression techniques, STNN can effectively avoid model overfitting and simultaneously consider both spatial and temporal correlations of input variables using deep convolutional networks with residual blocks. The use of the proposed STNN model, as well as the surface NO2 dataset, can benefit air quality monitoring, forecasting, and health burden assessments.

We extended its ability to perform long-term multi-step prediction and used advection and diffusion effects as additional constraints for graph neural network training.

According to the annual EEA reports, Poland is one of the most polluted countries in Europe, experiencing high PMx concentrations during winter that mostly result from large emissions and unfavourable weather conditions in combination with environmental features. Thus, in addition to implementing municipal mitigation strategies, alerting residents to pollution episodes through accurate PMx forecasting is necessary. This research aimed to assess the feasibility of short-term PMx forecasting via machine learning (ML) and the subsequent identification of the primary meteorological covariates. The data comprised 10 years of hourly winter PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations measured at 11 urban air quality monitoring stations, including background, traffic, and industrial sites, in four large Polish agglomerations, viz., Pozna?, KrakÃ³w, ?Ã³d?, and Gda?sk, which cover areas with high population density and diverse environments that extend from the Baltic Sea coast (Tricity) through the lowlands (Pozna? and ?Ã³d?) to the highlands (KrakÃ³w). We tested four ML models: AIC-based stepwise regression, two tree-based algorithms (random forests and XGBoost), and neural networks. Employing analysis and cross-validation, we found that XGBoost performed the best, followed by random forests and neural networks, and stepwise regression performed the worst. This ranking was apparent in the threshold exceedance values of the binary forecasts obtained via regression. Overall, our results confirm the high applicability of ML to short-term air quality prediction with the perfect prog approach.

In addition, a moving camera was used to collect real-time traffic. Models developed for fine particulate matter performed better than those for black carbon. For the same pollutants, machine learning exhibited superior performance over LUR, demonstrating that LUR performance could benefit from understanding how explanatory variables were expressed in machine learning models.

In this work, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to analyze and predict ambient PM2.5 in eight regional core cities in China to resolve the clashes, and the conclusions are listed as follows. Gaseous air pollutants (SO2, NO2, O3 and CO) are way more momentous than meteorological conditions in shaping PM2.5. PM2.5 level is dominated by the ups and downs of gaseous air pollutants, indicating the predominance of secondary inorganic aerosols and the existence of thermodynamic equilibrium between PM2.5 and gaseous air pollutants. The secondary PM2.5 tends to be generated within one hour. We quantitatively demonstrate that the primary emissions change and long-range transport are ubiquitously and conspicuously insignificant throughout the main cities of China and reductions of the gaseous air pollutants are most essential for regulating PM2.5. Furthermore, the phenology of local flora as the minor cause and lopsided thermodynamic equilibrium shift triggered by temperature change as the major cause elicit the severity of PM2.5 in wintertime--for every Celsius degree of temperature drop, PM2.5 increases by 5.9 ?g/m3.

In this study, the Prophet forecasting model (PFM) was used to predict both short-term and long-term air pollution in Seoul. The air pollutants forecasted in this study were PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, and CO, air pollutants responsible for numerous health conditions upon long-term exposure. Current chemical models to predict air pollution require complex source lists making them difficult to use. Machine learning models have also been implemented however their requirement of meteorological parameters render the models ineffective as additional models and infrastructure need to be in place to model meteorology. To address this, a model needs to be created that can accurately predict pollution based on time. A dataset containing three years worth of hourly air quality measurements in Seoul was sourced from the Seoul Open Data Plaza. To optimize the model, PFM has the following parameters: Model type, changepoints, seasonality, holidays, and error. Cross validation was performed on the 2017-18 data; then, the model predicted 2019 values. To compare the predicted and actual values and determine the accuracy of the model, the statistical indicators: Mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and coverage were used. PFM predicted PM2.5 and PM10 with a MAE value of 12.6 mg/m3 and 19.6 mg/m3, respectively. PFM also predicted SO2 and CO with a MAE value of 0.00124 ppm and 0.207 ppm, respectively. PFM's prediction of PM2.5 and PM10 had a MAE approximately 2 times and 4 times less, respectively, than comparable models. PFM's prediction of SO2 and CO had a MAE approximately five times and 50 times less, respectively, than comparable models. In most cases, PFM's ability to accurately forecast the concentration of air pollutants in Seoul up to one year in advance outperformed similar models proposed in literature. This study addresses the limitations of the prior two PFM studies by expanding the modelled air pollutants from three pollutants to six pollutants while increasing the prediction time from 3 days to 1 year. This is also the first research to use PFM in Seoul, Korea. To achieve more accurate results, a larger air pollution dataset needs to be implemented with PFM. In the future, PFM should be used to predict and model air pollution in other regions, especially those without advanced infrastructure to model meteorology alongside air pollution. In Seoul, Seoul's government can use PFM to accurately predict air pollution concentrations and plan accordingly.

For this novel framework, CEEMD has been adopted to decompose original MDA8_O3 history into several sub-series. After that, for each IMF, CRJ is used to extract time-series features. These time-series features are fed into appropriate machine learning methods for prediction. In addition to that, residual is also predicted through normal methods. A model, which is trained with data from 1 May 2014 to 31 May 2017, is validated with data from 1 June 2017 to 30 May 2018, obtained from four stations of Beijing, China. The hybrid model has input variables which are combined with related pollutants, meteorological forecasts and UV index, and predict maximum daily 8-h average ozone (MDA8_O3) concentration in different time intervals. Our experimental results show that the CEEMD+CRJ+MLR model exhibits the best performance compared with other benchmark models generally. For four stations, IA, MAE, RMSE and MAPE average of +1 (forecasting 1 day in advance) are 0.9763, 12.84, 17.81 and 18.5% respectively and of +2 are 0.9679, 15.17, 20.15 and 23.86% respectively.

For long time forecasting, the CEEMD+CRJ+MLR also shows its outstanding performance in whole levels and level III ozone concentration.

Therefore, it is very important to accurately forecast air quality in Macao. Machine learning methods such as random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), support vector regression (SVR), and multiple linear regression (MLR) were applied to predict the levels of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations in Macao. The forecast models were built and trained using the meteorological and air quality data from 2013 to 2018, and the air quality data from 2019 to 2021 were used for validation. Our results show that there is no significant difference between the performance of the four methods in predicting the air quality data for 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 2021 (the new normal period). However, RF performed significantly better than the other methods for 2020 (amid the pandemic) with a higher coefficient of determination (R2) and lower RMSE, MAE, and BIAS. The reduced performance of the statistical MLR and other ML models was presumably due to the unprecedented low levels of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in 2020.

However, air quality in many developing and highly urbanised countries remains unmonitored. Hence, a novel spatiotemporal interpolation modelling approach based on a deep learning and wavelet pre-processing technique was proposed in this paper. In more detail, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) were utilised to model the spatial variability of hourly NO2 levels at six urban sites in Central London, the United Kingdom. The models were trained using only the NO2 concentration data from the neighbouring sites. Benchmark models such as plain LSTM and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were also developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models.

Here, we use nine PM2.5 concentration models (i.e., exposure models) that span a wide range of methods to investigate i) PM2.5 concentrations in 2011, ii) potential changes in PM2.5 concentrations between 2011 and 2028 due to on-the-books regulations, and iii) PM2.5 exposure for the U.S. population and four racial/ethnic groups. The exposure models included two geophysical chemical transport models (CTMs), two interpolation methods, a satellite-derived aerosol optical depth-based method, a Bayesian statistical regression model, and three data-rich machine learning methods. We focused on annual predictions that were regridded to 12-km resolution over the conterminous U.S., but also considered 1-km predictions in sensitivity analyses. The exposure models predicted broadly consistent PM2.5 concentrations, with relatively high concentrations on average over the eastern U.S. and greater variability in the western U.S. However, differences in national concentration distributions (median standard deviation: 1.00 ?g m-3) and spatial distributions over urban areas were evident. Further exploration of these differences and their implications for specific applications would be valuable. PM2.5 concentrations were estimated to decrease by about 1 ?g m-3 on average due to modeled emission changes between 2011 and 2028, with decreases of more than 3 ?g m-3 in areas with relatively high 2011 concentrations that were projected to experience relatively large emission reductions. Agreement among models was closer for population-weighted than uniformly weighted averages across the domain. About 50% of the population was estimated to experience PM2.5 concentrations less than 10 ?g m-3 in 2011 and PM2.5 improvements of about 2 ?g m-3 due to modeled emission changes between 2011 and 2028. Two inequality metrics were used to characterize differences in exposure among the four racial/ethnic groups. The metrics generally yielded consistent information and suggest that the modeled emission reductions between 2011 and 2028 would reduce absolute exposure inequality on average.

A bottom-up approach, which is a typical emission inventory estimation method, requires a lot of human labor and material resources, whereas a top-down approach focuses on individual pollutants that can be measured directly as well as relying heavily on traditional numerical modeling. Lately, the deep neural network approach has achieved rapid development due to its high efficiency and nonlinear expression ability. In this study, we proposed a novel method to model the dual relationship between an emission inventory and pollution concentrations for emission inventory estimation. Specifically, we utilized a neural-network-based comprehensive chemical transport model (NN-CTM) to explore the complex correlation between emission and air pollution. We further updated the emission inventory based on back-propagating the gradient of the loss function measuring the deviation between NN-CTM and observations from surface monitors. We first mimicked the CTM model with neural networks (NNs) and achieved a relatively good representation of the CTM, with similarity reaching 95%. To reduce the gap between the CTM and observations, the NN model suggests updated emissions of NOx, NH3, SO2, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and primary PM2.5 changing, on average, by -1.34%, -2.65%, -11.66%, -19.19% and 3.51%, respectively, in China for 2015. Such ratios of NOx and PM2.5 are even higher (?1/410%) in regions that suffer from large uncertainties in original emissions, such as Northwest China. The updated emission inventory can improve model performance and make it closer to observations. The mean absolute error for NO2, SO2, O3 and PM2.5 concentrations are reduced significantly (by about 10%-20%), indicating the high feasibility of NN-CTM in terms of significantly improving both the accuracy of the emission inventory and the performance of the air quality model.

The existing deep learning-based predicted models generally consider either the temporal correlations of air quality monitoring stations or the nonlinear relationship between the PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 ?m) concentrations and explanatory variables. Spatial correlation has not been effectively incorporated into prediction models, therefore exhibiting poor performance in PM2.5 prediction tasks. Additionally, determining the manner by which to expand longer-term prediction tasks is still challenging. In this paper, to allow for spatiotemporal correlations, a spatiotemporal convolutional recursive long short-term memory (CR-LSTM) neural network model is proposed for predicting the PM2.5 concentrations in long-term prediction tasks by combining a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) neural network and a recursive strategy. Herein, the ConvLSTM network was used to capture the complex spatiotemporal correlations and to predict the future PM2.5 concentrations; the recursive strategy was used for expanding the long-term prediction tasks. The CR-LSTM model was used to realize the prediction of the future 24 h of PM2.5 concentrations for 12 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing by configuring both the appropriate time lag derived from the temporal correlations and the spatial neighbor-hood, including the hourly historical PM2.5 concentrations, the daily mean meteorological data, and the annual nighttime light and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results showed that the proposed CR-LSTM model achieved better performance (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.74; root mean square error (RMSE) = 18.96 ?g/m3) than other common models, such as multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), the conventional LSTM model, the LSTM extended (LSTME) model, and the temporal sliding LSTM extended (TS-LSTME) model. The proposed CR-LSTM model, implementing a combination of geographical rules, recursive strategy, and deep learning, shows improved performance in longer-term prediction tasks.

To meet this demand, a novel multi-scale hybrid learning framework based on robust local mean decomposition (RLMD) and moving window (MW) ensemble strategy is developed for PM2.5 and PM10 forecasting. In this architecture, the RLMD is adopted to adaptively decompose the PMC time series (PMCTS) into several production functions and one residue with different frequencies. These subseries are simpler than the original PMCTS, but they still work alongside mode aliasing. Thus, following the well-established Âlinear and nonlinearÂ modeling philosophy, a novel hybrid learning framework, composed of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and combined kernel function relevance vector machine (RVMcom), is proposed to capture both the linear and nonlinear patterns in the subseries. To obtain better final outputs, based on the definition of the ensemble improvement degree, the MW ensemble method is used to merge the forecasting results of all subseries. A comprehensive experiment is conducted using PM2.5 and PM10 datasets from four municipalities in China to investigate the forecasting performance of our proposed framework, and the results demonstrate that our proposed RLMD-ARIMAÂRVMcom-MW (R-A&amp;Rcom-M) model is superior to other considered methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. This means that the developed forecasting architecture has a great application value in the field of PMCTS prediction.

In order to achieve a win-win situation for the environment and urban development, the government has issued many policies to strengthen environmental protection. PM2.5 is the primary particulate matter in air pollution, so an accurate estimation of PM2.5 distribution is of great significance. Although previous studies have attempted to retrieve PM2.5 using geostatistical or aerosol remote sensing retrieval methods, the current rough resolution and accuracy remain as limitations of such methods. This paper proposes a fine-grained spatiotemporal PM2.5 retrieval method that comprehensively considers various datasets, such as Landsat 8 satellite images, ground monitoring station data, and socio-economic data, to explore the applicability of different machine learning algorithms in PM2.5 retrieval. Six typical algorithms were used to train the multi-dimensional elements in a series of experiments. The characteristics of retrieval accuracy in different scenarios were clarified mainly according to the validation index, R-2. The random forest algorithm was shown to have the best numerical and PM2.5-based air-quality-category accuracy, with a cross-validated R-2 of 0.86 and a category retrieval accuracy of 0.83, while both maintained excellent retrieval accuracy and achieved a high spatiotemporal resolution. Based on this retrieval model, we evaluated the PM2.5 distribution characteristics and hourly variation in the sample area, as well as the functions of different input variables in the model.

However, ground monitoring stations for PM2.5 measurements are mostly installed in population-dense or urban areas. Thus, satellite retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, which provide spatial and temporal surrogates of exposure, have become an important tool for PM2.5 estimates in a study area. In this study, we used AOD estimates of surface PM2.5 together with meteorological and land use variables to estimate monthly PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 3 km2 over Taiwan Island from 2015 to 2019. An ensemble two-stage estimation procedure was proposed, with a generalized additive model (GAM) for temporal-trend removal in the first stage and a random forest model used to assess residual spatiotemporal variations in the second stage. We obtained a model-fitting R2 of 0.98 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.40 ?g/m3. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) R2 with seasonal stratification was 0.82, and the RMSE was 3.85 ?g/m3, whereas the R2 and RMSE obtained by using the pure random forest approach produced R2 and RMSE values of 0.74 and 4.60 ?g/m3, respectively. The results indicated that the ensemble modeling approach had a higher predictive ability than the pure machine learning method and could provide reliable PM2.5 estimates over the entire island, which has complex terrain in terms of land use and topography.

In the absence of NO2 observations for Mainland China before 2013, training a model with 2013Â2018 data to make predictions for 2005Â2012 (back-extrapolation) could cause substantial estimation bias due to concept drift. Objective: This study aims to correct the estimation bias in order to reconstruct the spatiotemporal distribution of daily surface NO2 levels across China during 2005Â2018. Methods: On the basis of ground- and satellite-based data, we proposed the robust back-extrapolation with a random forest (RBE-RF) to simulate the surface NO2 through intermediate modeling of the scaling factors. For comparison purposes, we also employed a random forest (Base-RF), as a representative of the commonly used approach, to directly model the surface NO2 levels. Results: The validation against Taiwan's NO2 observations during 2005Â2012 showed that RBE-RF adequately corrected the substantial underestimation by Base-RF. The RMSE decreased from 10.1 to 8.2 Âµg/m3, 7.1 to 4.3 Âµg/m3, and 6.1 to 2.9 Âµg/m3 in predicting daily, monthly, and annual levels, respectively. For North China with the most severe pollution, the population-weighted NO2 ([NO2]pw) during 2005Â2012 was estimated as 40.2 and 50.9 Âµg/m3 by Base-RF and RBE-RF, respectively, i.e., 21.0% difference. While both models predicted that the national annual [NO2]pw increased during 2005Â2011 and then decreased, the interannual trends were underestimated by &gt;50.2% by Base-RF relative to RBE-RF. During 2005Â2018, the nationwide population that lived in the areas with NO2 &gt; 40 Âµg/m3 were estimated as 259 and 460 million by Base-RF and RBE-RF, respectively. Conclusion: With RBE-RF, we corrected the estimation bias in back-extrapolation and obtained a full-coverage dataset of daily surface NO2 across China during 2005Â2018, which is valuable for environmental management and epidemiological research.

Random forest algorithms that incorporated predictors derived from satellite, chemical transport model, and census tract resolution land-use data on traffic, meteorology, and emissions, which were rigorously tested by 10-fold cross-validation (CV), were then employed to estimate elemental and source-specific PM2.5 levels at non-monitoring site census-tracts over the study years. Model performances were moderate to good, with CV R2 ranging from 0.41 to 0.95.

A countryÂs PM2.5 can be affected not only by country factors but also by the neighboring countryÂs air quality factors. Therefore, forecasting PM2.5 requires collecting data from outside the country as well as from within which is necessary for policies and plans. The data set of many variables with a relatively small number of observations can cause a dimensionality problem and limit the performance of the deep learning model. This study used daily data for five years in predicting PM2.5 concentrations in eight Korean cities through deep learning models. PM2.5 data of China were collected and used as input variables to solve the dimensionality problem using principal components analysis (PCA). The deep learning models used were a recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). The performance of the models with and without PCA was compared using root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). As a result, the application of PCA in LSTM and BiLSTM, excluding the RNN, showed better performance: decreases of up to 16.6% and 33.3% in RMSE and MAE values. The results indicated that applying PCA in deep learning time series prediction can contribute to practical performance improvements, even with a small number of observations.

North Macedonia, as a developing country, has a serious problem with air pollution. The problem is highly present in its capital city, Skopje, where air pollution places it consistently within the top 10 cities in the world during the winter months. In this work, we propose using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models with long short-term memory units to predict the level of PM10 particles at 6, 12, and 24 h in the future. We employ historical air quality measurement data from sensors placed at multiple locations in Skopje and meteorological conditions such as temperature and humidity. We compare different deep learning modelsÂ performance to an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The obtained results show that the proposed models consistently outperform the baseline model and can be successfully employed for air pollution prediction.

There are many pollutants existing in the atmosphere today, ozone being one of the most threatening pollutants. It can cause serious health damage such as wheezing, asthma, inflammation, and early mortality rates. Although air pollution could be forecasted using chemical and physical models, machine learning techniques showed promising results in this area, especially artificial neural networks. Despite its importance, there has not been any research on predicting ground-level ozone in Jordan. In this paper, we build a model for predicting ozone concentration for the next day in Amman, Jordan using a mixture of meteorological and seasonal variables of the previous day. We compare a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression (DTR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. We also explore the effect of applying various smoothing filters on the time-series data such as moving average, Holt-Winters smoothing and Savitzky-Golay filters. We find that MLP outperformed the other algorithms and that using Savitzky-Golay improved the results by 50% for coefficient of determination (R2) and 80% for root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Another point we focus on is the variables required to predict ozone concentration. In order to reduce the time required for prediction, we perform feature selection which greatly reduces the time by 91% as well as shrinking the number of features required for prediction to the previous day values of ozone, humidity, and temperature. The final model scored 98.653% for R2, 1.016 ppb for RMSE and 0.800 ppb for MAE.

However, due to the complexity of air quality prediction which usually involves multiple factors, such as meteorological, spatial, and temporal properties, it is still a challenge to propose a model with required accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid ensemble model CERL to exploit the merits of both forward neural networks and recurrent neural networks that are designed for handling time serial data to predict air quality hourly. Measured air pollutant factors including Air Quality Index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and O3 are used as input to predict air quality from 1 to 8 h ahead. Based on the air quality prediction evaluation in Lanzhou and XiÂan, which are two important provincial capitals in Northwest China, CERL provides better performance over other baseline models. Moreover, as the step length increases, CERL has more obvious improvement. For example, the improvements of CERL in the 1-step, 3-step, 5-step, and 8-step prediction for PM2.5 in Lanzhou are 1.82%, 8.01%, 9.98%, and 20.03%, respectively.

It not only causes serious losses to our economy, but also brings great hidden dangers to the physical and mental health of urban residents. Therefore, it is urgent to prevent and control air pollution. Air quality prediction and forecasting must be carried out to prevent air pollution. Timely and accurate air quality prediction can not only help urban managers to make scientific and effective preventive measures, but also provide more healthy and safe travel strategies for urban residents. ChinaÂs air monitoring system is gradually improving, its scale is expanding, and a large amount of air quality data is accumulating. With the rapid expansion of data scale, the traditional method of air quality prediction technology has been unable to deal with these massive data. In this paper, 365 sets of air pollutant data from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in Shen Zhen were used as experimental objects. The improved SAPSO algorithm and PSO algorithm were used to optimize the parameters of SVM model and construct the air quality evaluation model. By analyzing the classification results of air quality grade, selecting relevant data and using partial least squares, the correlation coefficient matrix is established for the classification results, and the pollutant factors affecting air quality in Shenzhen are obtained.

The chaotic behaviour of air pollutants posing major difficulties in tracking their three-dimensional movements over diverse temporal domains is a significant challenge in designing practical air quality systems. This research paper builds a deep learning hybrid CLSTM model where convolutional neural network (CNN) is amalgamed with the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to forecast hourly TSP. The CNN model entails a data processer including feature extractors that draw upon statistically significant antecedent lagged predictor variables, whereas the LSTM model encapsulates a new feature mapping scheme to predict the next hourly TSP value. The hybrid CLSTM model is comprehensively benchmarked and is seen to outperform an ensemble of five machine learning models. The efficacy of the CLSTM model is elucidated in model testing phase at study sites in Queensland, Australia. Using performance metrics, visual analysis of TSP simulations relative to observations, and detailed error analysis, this study ascertains the CLSTM model's practical utility for air pollutant forecasting systems in health risk mitigation.

In order to predict the 1 day in advance air quality index (AQI) of Orumiyeh city, the hybrid single decomposition (HSD) and hybrid two-phase decomposition (HTPD) models were used. In the first step, the AQI data were decomposed by complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and was hybridized with general regression neural network (GRNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) as HSD models. In the second step, using variational mode decomposition (VMD) technique the results of the first intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of CEEMDAN model were decomposed into nine VMs and were predicted by GRNN and ELM models to obtain IMF1. Finally, in the third step, GRNN and ELM were used again to predict the IMF(S)as HTPD models. Results showed that in predicting AQI series data by HSD models both CEEMDAN-ELM and CEEMDAN-GRNN models were similarly accurate.

However, typical horizontal resolutions of nationwide CMAQ simulations (12 Ã 12 km2) cannot capture local-scale gradients for accurately assessing human exposures and environmental justice disparities. In this study, a Bayesian ensemble machine learning (BEML) framework, which integrates 13 learning algorithms, was developed for downscaling CMAQ estimates of ozone daily maximum 8 h averages to the census tract level, across the contiguous US, and was demonstrated for 2011. Three-stage hyperparameter tuning and targeted validations were designed to ensure the ensemble model's ability to interpolate, extrapolate, and capture concentration peaks. The Shapley value metric from coalitional game theory was applied to interpret the drivers of subgrid gradients. The flexibility (transferability) of the 2011-trained BEML model was further tested by evaluating its ability to estimate fine-scale concentrations for other years (2012-2017) without retraining. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the BEML approach to strictly ""data-limited"" situations, the model was applied to downscale CMAQ outputs for a future-year scenario-based simulation that considers effects of variations in meteorology associated with climate change.

The data used to construct the novel hybrid two-stage data filtering technique based on LSTM comprising of six meteorological parameters (i.e., wind direction, wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and rainfall) and two environmental factors (i.e., ozone and total suspended particulate). In the first stage, two robust feature selection methods, namely, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and the classification and regression tree (CART) approach, were adopted to explore the most significant predictors. Then in the second stage, the best subset regression (BSR) technique is utilized to determine the best subsets input combinations i.e., C1, C2, and C3 based on several particular metrics. The three BSR-based input combinations were employed in the LSTM model to estimate the PM2.5 and PM10.

Increasing PM2.5 concentrations derived from wildfire smoke and associated impacts on public health require dedicated epidemiological studies. Main sources of PM2.5 data are provided by government-operated monitors sparsely located across U.S., leaving several regions and potentially vulnerable populations unmonitored. Current approaches to estimate PM2.5 concentrations in unmonitored areas often rely on big data, such as satellite-derived aerosol properties and meteorological variables, apply computationally-intensive deterministic modeling, and do not distinguish wildfire-specific PM2.5 from other sources of emissions such as traffic and industrial sources. Furthermore, modelling wildfire-specific PM2.5 presents a challenge since measurements of the smoke contribution to PM2.5 pollution are not available. Here, we aim to use statistical methods to isolate wildfire-specific PM2.5 from other sources of emissions. Our study presents an ensemble model that optimally combines multiple machine learning algorithms (including gradient boosting machine, random forest and deep learning), and a large set of explanatory variables to, first, estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations at the ZIP code level, a relevant spatiotemporal resolution for epidemiological studies.

This study proposed a novel model by coupling long short-term memory neural network with transfer learning (TL-LSTM), with meteorology and pollutant concentration information as the model input. L2 regularization was applied to reduce the risk of overfitting and to improve the accuracy and generalization ability of the model prediction.

Sobol analysis indicated that wind speed was the most sensitive factor in O3 prediction, largely due to the development of land-sea breeze circulation which effectively traps pollutants and expedites O3 formation. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the TL-LSTM in predicting the daily O3 concentration in Hong Kong. Thus, TL-LSTM can be promulgated into other photochemically active regions to assist in O3 pollution forecasting and management.

In our study, we present a validated framework to predict the daily PM2.5 distributions, exemplified by a use case of Shijiazhuang City, China, based on daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) datasets. The framework involves obtaining the high-resolution spatiotemporal AOD distributions, estimation of the spatial distributions of PM2.5 and the prediction of these based on a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model. In the estimation part, the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model has been determined as the estimation model with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 32.86 Âµg/m3 and the highest coefficient of determination regression score function (R2) of 0.71, compared to other common models used as a baseline for comparison (linear, ridge, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and cubist). For the prediction part, after validation and comparison with a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), which is a traditional time-series prediction model, in both time and space, the ConvLSTM gives a more accurate performance for the prediction, with a total average prediction RMSE of 14.94 Âµg/m3 compared to SARIMAÂs 17.41 Âµg/m3 . Furthermore, ConvLSTM is more stable and with less fluctuations for the prediction of PM2.5 in time, and it can also eliminate better the spatial predicted errors compared to SARIMA.

Therefore, in this study, three machine learning algorithmsÂnamely, decision tree (DT), boosted regression tree (BRT), and random forest (RF)Âwere applied for the prediction of PM10 in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. The results from these three methods were compared to find the best method to predict PM10 concentration for the next day by using the maximum daily data from January 2002 to December 2017. To this end, 80% of the data were used for training and 20% for validation of the models. The performance measure of the PM10 concentration was based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision for RF, BRT, and DT, respectively, which indicates that these three models were developed effectively, and they are applicable in the prediction of other atmospheric environmental data.

Studying the concentration of PM2.5, as the main component of haze, is the key to control air quality. Extent research lacks spatiotemporal correlations and full regional coverage. Therefore, a fine-grained prediction method was developed for continuous prediction of station-specific and regional PM2.5 concentrations over 24 h that comprise two parts: a site prediction model (TSRT model) and a grid prediction model. The TSRT model includes a long short-term memory-based temporal predictor that uses temporally related features as inputs, a Long Short-Term Memory-based spatial predictor that requires spatially related features as inputs, and a regression model based on regression-tree algorithm to aggregate the predictions of temporal and spatial predictors. The grid concentration prediction model based on a fully connected back-propagation neural network with grid characteristics as inputs achieved a PM2.5 regional prediction with 1-km2 non-overlapping grids across the study area. The approach was evaluated with data from 101 monitoring stations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. The results imply that: (1) the forecasting performance of TSRT models is better than other possible methods with average R2 = 0.9 and average MAE = 10.35 ?g/m3, (2) R2 and MAE values of the grid prediction model are 0.77 and 21.87 ?g/m3, supporting the advantages of our method over well-known interpolation models, such as kriging interpolation, and (3) the method provides appropriate PM2.5 concentration prediction in the next 24 h.

This paper proposes a restricted gradient-descent linear hybrid machine learning model (RGD-LHMLM) by integrating a random forest (RF), a gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), and a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the concentration of PM2.5 in China in 2019. The research data included Himawari-8 AOD with high spatiotemporal resolution, ERA5 meteorological data, and geographic information. The results showed that, in the hybrid model developed by linear fitting, the DNN accounted for the largest proportion, and the weight coefficient was 0.62. The R2 values of RF, GBRT, and DNN were reported as 0.79, 0.81, and 0.8, respectively. Preferably, the generalization ability of the mixed model was better than that of each sub-model, and R2 (determination coefficient) reached 0.84, and RMSE (root mean square error) and MAE (mean absolute error) were reported as 12.92 and 8.01?gm-3, respectively. For the RGD-LHMLM, R2 was above 0.7 in more than 70% of the sites and RMSE and MAE were below 20 and 15?gm-3, respectively, in more than 70% of the sites due to the correlation coefficient having a seasonal difference between the meteorological factor and PM2.5. Furthermore, the hybrid model performed best in winter (mean R2 was 0.84) and worst in summer (mean R2 was 0.71). The spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of PM2.5 in China were then estimated and analyzed. According to the results, there was severe pollution in winter with an average concentration of PM2.5 being reported as 62.10?gm-3.

To improve the performance of pf-RSM, a novel self-adaptive RSM (SA-RSM) was proposed by integrating the machine learning-based stepwise regression for establishing robust models to increase the computational efficiency and the collinearity diagnosis for reducing marginal effects caused by overfitting. The pilot study case demonstrated that compared with pf-RSM, SA-RSM can effectively reduce the training number by 70% and 40% and the fitting time by 40% and 52%, and decrease the prediction error by 49% and 74% for PM2.5 and O3 predictions respectively; moreover, the isopleths of PM2.5 or O3 as a function of their precursors generated by SA-RSM were more similar to those derived by chemical transport model (CTM), after successfully addressing the marginal effect issue.

Therefore, prediction of air quality is a subject worth in-depth research and has received substantial interest in the recent years from academic units and the government. Feature selection methods are applied before prediction to identify potentially significant predictors based on exploratory data analysis. In this research work, a feature selection method based on Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO) named Correlation based Adaptive LASSO (CbAL) Regression method has been proposed for predicting the air quality. For the experimental evaluation, cross regional data, including the concentration of pollutants and the meteorological factors of Delhi and its surrounding cities, has been taken from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) Website. Further, to validate this feature selection method, various machine learning techniques have been taken into consideration and some preventive measures have been suggested to enhance the air quality. Feature selection analysis reveals that carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and Ozone are the most important factors for forecasting the air quality and the pollutants found in the cities of Noida and Gurugram have a more substantial impact on the Air Quality Index of Delhi than other surrounding cities.

Specifically, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) constitute a significant breakthrough in understanding the complex sequential behavioral dependencies of the time series. Further, LSTM models justify well with the speedÂaccuracy tradeoff, among other deep learning models. However, there are several limitations of such deep learning models. Firstly, the addition of multiple hidden layers, on the one hand, improves the performance but, on the other hand, requires extensive hardware and computation capabilities. Secondly, most of the previous works that utilized LSTMs for air quality forecasting do not consider the issue of optimal hyperparameter calibration. While deciding the gradient, network learning parameters should be so fixed such that the model does not underfit or overfit. To address these issues, a stochastic optimization algorithm, mimicking the pattern of flocking birds, is utilized to find the most fitting solution in the parameter search space. Particle swarm optimization setup primarily models varying particles representing parameters to reach an optimum state. Furthermore, the Spatio-temporal instabilities of LSTM models are addressed in this work using preprocessing, segmentation and feature engineering to understand seasonal and trend characteristics along with the Spatio-temporal correlation of the time series. The proposed model is employed on the air quality dataset of 15 locations in India. A variety of experiments are performed to prove the superiority of the proposed method. Firstly, a comparison with traditional sequential models and deep learning models is done. Secondly, results are further evaluated over several existing benchmark dataset samples.

Moreover, the spatiotemporal resolution of air pollution modelling approaches must be improved in order to achieve more accurate estimates. If not, the exposure assessments will not be applicable in future health risk assessments. To deal with this challenge, this study featured Land-Use Regression (LUR) models that use machine learning to assess the spatial-temporal variability of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Daily average NO2 data was collected from 70 fixed air quality monitoring stations, belonging to the Taiwanese EPA, on the main island of Taiwan. Around 0.41 million observations from 2000 to 2016 were used for the analysis. Several datasets were employed to determine spatial predictor variables, including the EPA environmental resources dataset, the meteorological dataset, the land-use inventory, the landmark dataset, the digital road network map, the digital terrain model, MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index database, and the power plant distribution dataset. Regarding analyses, conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR were performed first to identify important predictor variables. A Deep Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms were then used to fit the prediction model based on the variables selected by the LUR models. Lastly, data splitting, 10-fold cross validation, external data verification, and seasonal-based and county-based validation methods were applied to verify the robustness of the developed models. The results demonstrated that the proposed conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR models captured 65% and 78%, respectively, of NO2 variation. When the XGBoost algorithm was further incorporated in LUR and hybrid-LUR, the explanatory power increased to 84% and 91%, respectively. The Hybrid Kriging-LUR with XGBoost algorithm outperformed all other integrated methods. This study demonstrates the value of combining Hybrid Kriging-LUR model and an XGBoost algorithm to estimate the spatial-temporal variability of NO2 exposure.

Combined with the Himawari-8 AOD, meteorological, and auxiliary factors, the hourly PM10 concentration in China (spatial resolution: 0.05 Ã 0.05Â°) was obtained. The results show that AOD has the highest contribution to the importance of features in the AOD-PM10 model, accounting for approximately 13.5%, and the contributions of boundary layer height, temperature, and relative humidity to the importance of features were 11%, 8.6%, and 7%, respectively.

Traditional numerical air quality models require a high computational cost associated with running large-scale numerical simulations. In this work, we introduce a hybrid model (VAE-GAN) combining a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn the dynamic ozone distributions in spatial and temporal spaces. The VAE-GAN model can not only decipher the complex nonlinear relationship between the inputs (the past states/ozone and meteorological factors) and outputs (ozone), but also provide ozone forecasts for a long lead-time beyond the training period. The performance of VAE-GAN is demonstrated in hourly and daily spatio-temporal ozone forecasts over China. The training datasets from 2013 to 2017 and validation datasets from 2018 to 2019 are the collection of data from the air quality reanalysis datasets. With the use of VAE, large dataset sizes are decreased by three orders of magnitude, enabling hourly and daily forecasts to be computed in seconds. Results show that the VAE-GAN achieves a reasonable accuracy in the prediction of both the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of hourly and daily ozone fields, as compared to the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (commonly used in China), the reanalysis data and observations during the validation period. Thus, the VAE-GAN is a cost-effective tool for large data-driven predictions, which can potentially reinforce air pollution prediction efforts in providing risk assessment and management in a timely manner.

Several countries have implemented monitoring stations to collect air pollution particle data and meteorological information using parameters such as hourly timespans. This research focuses on unravelling a new framework for air quality prediction worldwide and features Busan, South Korea as its model city. The paper proposes the application of an attention-based convolutional BiLSTM autoencoder model. The proposed deep learning model has been trained on a distributed framework, referred to data parallelism, to forecast the intensity of particle pollution (PM2.5 and PM10). The algorithm automatically learns the intrinsic correlation among the particle pollution in different locations. Each locationÂs meteorological and traffic data is extensively exploited to improve the modelÂs performance. The model has been trained using air quality particle data and car traffic information. The traffic information is obtained by a device which counts cars passing a specific area through the YOLO algorithm, and then sends the data to a stacked deep autoencoder to be encoded alongside the meteorological data before the final prediction. In addition, multiple one-dimensional CNN layers are used to obtain the local spatial features jointly with a stacked attention-based BiLSTM layer to figure out how air quality particles are correlated in space and time. The evaluation of the new attention-based convolutional BiLSTM autoencoder model was derived from data collected and retrieved from comprehensive experiments conducted in South Korea. The results not only show that the framework outperforms the previous models both on short-and long-term predictions but also indicate that traffic information can improve the accuracy of air quality forecasting. For instance, during PM2.5 prediction, the proposed attention-based model obtained the lowest MAE (5.02 and 22.59, respectively, for short-term and long-term prediction), RMSE (7.48 and 28.02) and SMAPE (17.98 and 39.81) among all the models, which indicates strong accuracy between observed and predicted values. It was also found that the newly proposed model had the lowest average training time compared to the baseline algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed framework was successfully deployed in a cloud server in order to provide future air quality information in real time and when needed. Â© 2022 by the authors.

While accurately monitoring and forecasting air pollution are highly crucial, existing data-driven models have yet fully captured the complex interactions between the temporal characteristics of air pollution and the spatial characteristics of urban dynamics. Our proposed Deep-AIR fills this gap to provide fine-grained city-wide air pollution estimation and station-wide forecast, by exploiting domain-specific features (including Air Pollution, Weather, Urban Morphology, Transport, and Time-sensitive features), with a hybrid CNN-LSTM structure to capture the spatio-temporal features, and $1 imes 1$ convolution layers to enhance the learning of temporal and spatial interaction. Deep-AIR outperforms compatible baselines by a higher accuracy of 1.5%, 2.7%, and 2.3% for Hong Kong and 1.4%, 1.4% and 3.3% for Beijing in fine-grained 1-hr pollution estimation, and 1-hr and 24-hr forecasts, respectively. Saliency analysis reveals that for Hong Kong, spatial features, including street canyon and road density, are the best predictors for NO2, while temporal features, including historical air pollutants and weather, are the best predictors for PM2.5. For Beijing, historical air pollutant data, traffic congestion, wind direction and seasonal indicator are the best predictors for all pollutants. PM10 in Hong Kong is achieving the best estimation and forecast accuracy, whilst CO in Beijing is achieving the best results.

Therefore, accurate forecasting of air pollutant concentration is crucial to mitigate the associated health risk. This study aims to predict the hourly PM2.5 concentration for an urban area in Malaysia using a hybrid deep learning model. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) was employed to decompose the original sequence data of particulate matter into several subseries. Long short-term memory (LSTM) was used to individually forecast the decomposed subseries considering the influence of air pollutant parameters for 1-h ahead forecasting. Then, the outputs of each forecast were aggregated to obtain the final forecasting of PM2.5 concentration. This study utilized two air quality datasets from two monitoring stations to validate the performance of proposed hybrid EEMD-LSTM model based on various data distributions. The spatial and temporal correlation for the proposed dataset were analysed to determine the significant input parameters for the forecasting model. The LSTM architecture consists of two LSTM layers and the data decomposition method is added in the data pre-processing stage to improve the forecasting accuracy.

However, the existing machine learning prediction methods of air quality fail to analyze the reasons for the change of air pollution concentration because most of the prediction methods take more focus on the model selection. Since the framework of recent deep learning is very flexible, the model may be deep and complex in order to fit the dataset. Therefore, overfitting problems may exist in a single deep neural network model when the number of weights in the deep neural network model is large. Besides, the learning rate of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) treats all parameters equally, resulting in local optimal solution. In this paper, the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to analyze the inherent correlation of PM2.5 and other auxiliary data such as meteorological data, season data, and time stamp data which are applied to cluster for enhancing the performance. Extracted features are helpful to build a deep ensemble network (EN) model which combines the recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to predict the PM2.5 concentration of the next hour. The weights of the submodel change with the accuracy of them in the validation set, so the ensemble has generalization ability. The adaptive moment estimation (Adam) an algorithm for stochastic optimization is used to optimize the weights instead of SGD. In order to compare the overall performance of different algorithms, the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as accuracy metrics in the experiments of this study.

While satellite-based statistical/machine-learning methods can be used for estimating high-resolution ground-level PM2.5 concentration data, their applications have been hindered by limited accuracy in daily estimates during years without PM2.5 measurements and massive missing values due to satellite retrieval data. To address these issues, we developed a new spatiotemporal high-resolution PM2.5 hindcast modeling framework to generate the full-coverage, daily, 1-km PM2.5 data for China for the period 2000–2020 with improved accuracy. Our modeling framework incorporated information on changes in observation variables between periods with and without monitoring data and filled gaps in PM2.5 estimates induced by satellite data using imputed high-resolution aerosol data. Compared to previous hindcast studies, our method achieved superior overall cross-validation (CV) R2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.90 and 12.94 μg/m3 and significantly improved the model performance in years without PM2.5 measurements, raising the leave-one-year-out CV R2 [RMSE] to 0.83 [12.10 μg/m3] at a monthly scale (0.65 [23.29 μg/m3] at a daily scale).

Many studies have employed traditional statistical models and remote-sensing technologies to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. However, statistical models have shown inconsistency in PM2.5 concentration predictions, while machine learning algorithms have excellent predictive capacity, but little research has been done on the complementary advantages of diverse approaches. The present study proposed the best subset regression model and machine learning approaches, including random tree, additive regression, reduced error pruning tree, and random subspace, to estimate the ground-level PM2.5 concentrations over Dhaka. This study used advanced machine learning algorithms to measure the effects of meteorological factors and air pollutants (NOX, SO2, CO, and O3) on the dynamics of PM2.5 in Dhaka from 2012 to 2020. Results showed that the best subset regression model was well-performed for forecasting PM2.5 concentrations for all sites based on the integration of precipitation, relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, SO2, NOX, and O3. Precipitation, relative humidity, and temperature have negative correlations with PM2.5. The concentration levels of pollutants are much higher at the beginning and end of the year. Random subspace is the optimal model for estimating PM2.5 because it has the least statistical error metrics compared to other models. This study suggests ensemble learning models to estimate PM2.5 concentrations.

Surface PM2.5 and O3 concentrations can be monitored from satellites, but most retrieval methods retrieve PM2.5 or O3 separately and disregard the shared information between the two air pollutants, for example due to common emission sources. Using surface observations across China spanning 2014–2021, we found a strong relationship between PM2.5 and O3 with distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Thus, in this study, we propose a new deep learning model called the Simultaneous Ozone and PM2.5 inversion deep neural Network (SOPiNet), which allows for daily real-time monitoring and full coverage of PM2.5 and O3 simultaneously at a spatial resolution of 5 km. SOPiNet employs the multi-head attention mechanism to better capture the temporal variations in PM2.5 and O3 based on previous days’ conditions. Applying SOPiNet to MODIS data over China in 2022, using 2019–2021 to construct the network, we found that simultaneous retrievals of PM2.5 and O3 improved the performance compared with retrieving them independently: the temporal R2 increased from 0.66 to 0.72 for PM2.5, and from 0.79 to 0.82 for O3.

Auto-correlation analysis and cluster analysis were first utilized to reveal the inherent temporal and spatial properties respectively. They demonstrated that there existed temporal daily periodicity and spatial similarity in AQMN. Then the identified spatiotemporal properties were sufficiently leveraged, and monitoring network topological information, as well as auxiliary pollutants and meteorology were also adaptively integrated into the model. The hourly observed data from 51 air quality monitoring stations and meteorological data in Shanghai were employed to evaluate it. Results show that the Res-GCN-BiLSTM model was better adapted to the pollutant characteristics and improved the prediction accuracy, with nearly 11% and 17% improvements in mean absolute error for NO2 and O3, respectively compared to the best performing baseline model.

Many machine-learning-based retrieval models have been established for estimating various kinds of air pollutants. These methods mainly aimed to estimate a single pollutant (single-pollutant approach). However, different air pollutants interact with each other and are highly correlated. Building a unified model and conducting a joint retrieval of multiple pollutant can make a better use of these connections and improve the model efficiency. This study proposed a physics-informed multi-task deep neural network (phyMTDNN) for the joint retrieval of six main air pollutants, i.e., PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3. The relationships among these pollutants were used to design the physics-informed network structure and loss function. Top-of-atmosphere reflectance which can generate retrieval results at ultrahigh resolution was used as model input. Experiments for mainland China in 2019 showed that the proposed model successfully achieved simultaneous estimation of six air pollutants, with the cross-validated R2 for the six pollutants varying from 0.72 to 0.90. The contrast experiments proved that physics-informed network structure contributed to the most of the model performance improvement. Compared to the single-pollutant approach, phyMTDNN ameliorated the model accuracy on traces gases retrieval. Furthermore, the modeling efficiency was largely improved in that a lot of repetitive work was avoided and modeling method was optimized. The proposed new multiple-pollutant retrieval frame can be applied to various fields for multi-variate retrieval or estimation. © 2022",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159542,6,6,Yes,DNN,,Yes,"China,Hong Kong",estimation,"PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate O3 predictions can better help assess its impacts on public health and facilitate the development of effective prevention and control measures. In this study, we used a random forest (RF) model to construct a bias-correction model to correct the bias in the predictions of hourly O3 (O3-1h), daily maximum 8-h O3 (O3-Max8h), and daily maximum 1-h O3 (O3-Max1h) concentrations from the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model in the Yangtze River Delta region. The results show that the RF model successfully captures the nonlinear response relationship between O3 and its influence factors, and has an outstanding performance in correcting the bias of O3 predictions. The normalized mean biases (NMBs) of O3-1h, O3-Max8h, and O3-Max1h decrease from 15.8%, 20.0%, and 17.0.% to 0.5%, −0.8%, and 0.1%, respectively; correlation coefficients increase from 0.78, 0.90, and 0.89 to 0.94, 0.95, and 0.94, respectively. For O3-1h and O3-Max8h, the original CMAQ model shows an obvious bias in the central and southern Zhejiang region, while the RF model decreases the NMB values from 54% to −1% and 34% to −4%, respectively. The O3-1h bias is mainly caused by the bias of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Relative humidity and temperature are also important factors that lead to the bias of O3. For high O3 concentrations, the temperature bias and O3 observations are the major reasons for the discrepancy between the model and the observations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120926,6,6,Yes,RF,,No,China,prediction,O3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PM2.5 pollution has become the most pressing aspect of UB air pollution. Therefore, monitoring and predicting PM2.5 concentration in UB is of great significance for the health of the local people and environmental management. As of yet, very few studies have used models to predict PM2.5 concentrations in UB. Using data from 0:00 on June 1, 2018 to 23:00 on April 30, 2020, we proposed two deep learning models based on Bayesian optimized LSTM (Bayes-LSTM) and CNN-LSTM. We utilized hourly observed data including Himawari8 (H8) aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorology, and PM2.5 concentration as input for prediction of PM2.5 concentrations. The correlation strengths between meteorology, AOD, and PM2.5 was analyzed using the grey correlation analysis method; the comparison of the performance improvement of the model by using the AOD input value was tested, and the performance of these models was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The prediction accuracies of Bayes-LSTM and CNN-LSTM deep learning models were both improved when AOD was included as an input parameter. Improvement of the prediction accuracy of the CNN-LSTM model was particularly enhanced in the non-heating season; in the heating season, the prediction accuracy of the Bayes-LSTM model slightly improved, while the prediction accuracy of the CNN-LSTM model slightly decreased. We propose two novel deep learning models for PM2.5 concentration prediction in UB, Bayes-LSTM, and CNN-LSTM deep learning models.

In this study, a novel integrated forecasting model of the air quality index (AQI) is suggested to carry out reliable prediction, providing useful references for urban air pollution control, public health construction, and residents' travel planning. Firstly, the original data is decomposed by the method of complementary set empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), and the subsequences of different frequencies are formed. Secondly, the fuzzy entropy (FE) algorithm is used to reconstruct the subsequence. Then, the combined forecasting model is established, and different prediction methods are selected for different frequency subsequences. The new high-frequency sequences, low-frequency sequences, and trend sequences are predicted by the whale algorithm optimized long short term neural network (WOA-LSTM) and the extreme learning machine (ELM), respectively. Empirical analysis are carried out with the example of Beijing and Chengdu. The results indicated that: (1) The proposed CEEMD—FE—WOA-LSTM—ELM model effectively integrates the characteristics of the original sequence and has the highest prediction accuracy among all the comparison models. (2) It is necessary to preprocess the data, which can effectively extract data features. Taking Beijing as an example, compared with the non-decomposition model, after adding the decomposition algorithm, the prediction accuracy rate (PA) is increased by 8.55% on average, the RMSE is decreased by 10.36 on average, and the MAPE is decreased by 6.11% on average. (3) The overall prediction level and prediction accuracy can be effectively increased by applying various prediction methods for recombination sequences with various frequency.

Considering the complexity of air quality prediction and the high-performance advantages of deep learning methods, this paper proposes a second prediction method of air pollutant concentration based on the Kalman-attention-LSTM (Kalman filter, attention and long short-term memory) model. Firstly, an exploratory analysis is made between the actual environmental measurement data from the monitoring site and the first forecast data from the WRF-CMAQ model. An air quality index (AQI) was used as a measure of air pollution degree. Then, the Kalman filter (KF) is used to fuse the actual environmental measurement data from the monitoring site and the first forecast results from the WRF-CMAQ model. Finally, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model with the attention mechanism is used as a single factor prediction model for an AQI prediction. In the prediction of O3 which is the main pollutant affecting the AQI, the results show that the second prediction based on the Kalman-attention-LSTM model features a better fitting effect, compared with the six models.

In particular, PM2.5 air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular and respiratory problems. Therefore, air quality management is an essential issue for densely populated cities to reduce or prevent the adverse effects of air pollution. Considering this, reliable models for pre-dicting pollution levels for pollutants like PM2.5 are critical tools for decision-making. For this purpose, this study presents three kinds of deep learning (DL) algorithms (LSTM, RNN, and GRU) that utilize a time-windowing strategy to predict the hourly concentration of PM2.5 in the Istanbul metropolitan. The models were trained and tested using large data sets that envelope air quality parameters (PM2.5, SO2, NO, NO2, NOX, and O3) and meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and air pressure) for about five years. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM+LSTM model performs significantly better with an R2 of 0.98 and 0.97 at the significance level (p < 0.05) for training and test sets compared to other deep learning algorithms. In addition, data for one year from several stations located in nine different districts of Istanbul were used to evaluate the proposed model's generalization ability. As a result, the proposed LSTM+LSTM model has a good generalization ability with an R2 accuracy rate of 0.90 (p < 0.05) and above for all stations and can be used for non-linear, non-stationary multidi-mensional time series data.

Five cities with unique meteorological and economic characteristics were selected to assess the predictive ability of the proposed model. The results revealed that PM2.5 pollution was generally more severe in inland cities (66.98 Â± 0.76 ?g m?3) than in coastal cities (40.46 Â± 0.40 ?g m-3). The modelling comparison showed that in each city, the secondary decomposition algorithm improved the accuracy and prediction stability of the prediction models. When compared with other prediction models, LSTM effectively extracted featured information and achieved relatively accurate time-series prediction.

It is crucial to realize more accurate predictions of PM2.5 and establish a high-accuracy PM2.5 prediction model due to their social impacts and cross-field applications in geospatial engineering. To further boost the accuracy of PM2.5 prediction results, this paper proposes a new wavelet PM2.5 prediction system (called WD-OSMSSA-KELM model) based on a new, improved variant of the salp swarm algorithm (OSMSSA), kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), wavelet decomposition, and Boruta-XGBoost (B-XGB) feature selection. First, we applied the B-XGB feature selection to realize the best features for predicting hourly PM2.5 concentrations. Then, we applied the wavelet decomposition (WD) algorithm to reach the multi-scale decomposition results and single-branch reconstruction of PM2.5 concentrations to mitigate the prediction error produced by time series data. In the next stage, we optimized the parameters of the KELM model under each reconstructed component. An improved version of the SSA is proposed to reach higher performance for the basic SSA optimizer and avoid local stagnation problems. In this work, we propose new operators based on oppositional-based learning and simplex-based search to mitigate the core problems of the conventional SSA. In addition, we utilized a time-varying parameter instead of the main parameter of the SSA. To further boost the exploration trends of SSA, we propose using the random leaders to guide the swarm towards new regions of the feature space based on a conditional structure. After optimizing the model, the optimized model was utilized to predict the PM2.5 concentrations, and different error metrics were applied to evaluate the modelÂs performance and accuracy.

To advance modelling of PNC, we aimed to develop and compare the performance of parametric and non-parametric machine learning land-use regression (LUR) models to predict hourly average PNC. We used data from 25 short-term stationary campaigns and five long-term sites during 2009Â2012 in the Brisbane Metropolitan Area, Australia. We analysed three particle size ranges of total PNC (<30 nm, <414 nm and <3000 nm) as response variables, and over 150 independent variables, including land use, roads and traffic, population, distance, elevation, meteorology and time of day as potential predictors of PNC. The LUR models were developed separately for All Days, Nuc Days (when particle nucleation occurred), and No-nuc Days (when no particle nucleation occurred). We selected two algorithms to develop LUR models for PNC: a random forest (RF) model, and a generalised additive model (GAM) based on the least angle regression (LARS). The best LARS model for <30 nm, <414 nm and <3000 nm explained 30%, 31%, and 34%, respectively, whereas the best RF models were significantly better, explaining 73%, 64%, and 88%, respectively. Using this novel approach, we provided new insights into spatial variation in PNC and also demonstrated that the non-parametric RF model is a better choice for developing a LUR model for PNCs because of its robust predictive performance in comparison with the LARS parametric regression model.

The measurements of nine meteorological parameters were introduced as independent variables. The goal was to carefully study a limited number of initial predictors and extract stochastic information from them to build an extended set of data that allowed the creation of highly efficient predictive models. Four base models using random forest, CART ensemble and bagging, and their rotation variants, were built and evaluated. The heterogeneity of these base models was achieved by introducing five types of diversities, including a new simplified selective ensemble algorithm. The predictions from the four base models were then used as predictors in multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models. All models were statistically tested using out-of-bag or with 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation. In addition, a variable importance analysis was conducted. The proposed framework was used for short-term forecasting of out-of-sample data for seven days. It was shown that the stacked models outperformed all single base models. An index of agreement IA = 0.986 and a coefficient of determination of about 95% were achieved. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Since 2005, Fujian Province of Mainland China and Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait have both implemented aggressive air pollution control policies designed based on different principles, but a comprehensive evaluation of these control policies on PM2.5pollution levels is still lacking. In the current study, we assessed the effects of these policies in the Taiwan Strait Region from 2005 to 2018 using full-coverage, high-resolution PM2.5generated by a satellite-driven machine learning model. A ten-fold cross-validation for our prediction model showed an R2value of 0.89, demonstrating that these predictions can be used for policy evaluation. During the 14-year period, PM2.5levels in all areas of Fujian and Taiwan underwent a significant decrease. Separate regression models for policy evaluation in Taiwan and Fujian showed that all considered policies have mitigated PM2.5pollution to various degrees. The Clean Air Action Plans (CAAP) is the most effective control policy in Taiwan, while the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) and Three-year Action Plan for Blue Skies (3YAP-BS) as well as their provincial implementation plans are the most successful in Fujian.

These models typically lack microscale variables (e.g., street level), which may improve prediction with fine-spatial gradients. We developed microscale variables of the urban environment including Point of Interest (POI) data, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, and satellite-based measures of urban form. We developed United States national models for six criteria pollutants (NO2, PM2.5, O3, CO, PM10, SO2) using various modeling approaches: Stepwise Regression + kriging (SW-K), Partial Least Squares + kriging (PLS-K), and Machine Learning + kriging (ML-K). We compared predictor variables (e.g., traditional vs microscale) and emerging modeling approaches (ML-K) to well-established approaches (i.e., traditional variables in a PLS-K or SW-K framework). We found that combined predictor variables (traditional + microscale) in the ML-K models outperformed the well-established approaches (10-fold spatial cross-validation (CV) R2 increased 0.02-0.42 [average: 0.19] among six criteria pollutants). Comparing all model types using microscale variables to models with traditional variables, the performance is similar (average difference of 10-fold spatial CV R2 = 0.05) suggesting microscale variables are a suitable substitute for traditional variables.

Both the developed and developing countries are undergoing a high concentration of pollution levels. Fine particulate matter PM2.5 (particles having a diameter less than 2.5 ?m) and PM10 (particles having a diameter less than 10 ?m) can easily penetrate the lungs and respiratory system and causes adverse health issues like heart attacks, cardiovascular diseases, lung function reduction. Real-time pollutant information is of great importance to providing prompt and complete information on air quality. Air pollution forecasting is another significant step of air pollution management, which can help policymakers and citizens make proper decisions to prevent air pollution-related diseases. This research study explores a novel pollutant forecasting model named as Multi-output temporal convolutional network autoencoder (MO-TCNA). The model accumulates each step's predicted values to perform multi-step ahead long-term forecasting for multiple pollutants and multiple sites in a single training model. The MO-TCNA network serves both the PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants forecasting for various locations instead of performing single output and site-specific pollutant forecasting. Consequently, the experimental results show that the MO-TCNA network is time-saving and has better performance than the traditional site-specific forecasting models.

Numerous statistical prediction models have been used to estimate ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants in urban environments, with some incorporating machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve predictive power. However, many ML approaches for predicting ambient pollutant concentrations to date have used principal component analysis (PCA) with traditional regression algorithms to explore linear correlations between variables and to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Moreover, while most urban air quality prediction models have traditionally incorporated explanatory variables such as meteorological, land use, transportation/mobility, and/or co-pollutant factors, recent research has shown that local emissions from building infrastructure may also be useful factors to consider in estimating urban pollutant concentrations. Here we propose an enhanced ML approach for predicting urban ambient PM2.5 concentrations that hybridizes cascade and PCA methods to reduce the dimensionality of the data-space and explore nonlinear effects between variables. We test the approach using different durations of time series air quality datasets of hourly PM2.5 concentrations from three air quality monitoring sites in different urban neighborhoods in Chicago, IL to explore the influence of dynamic human-related factors, including mobility (i.e., traffic) and building occupancy patterns, on model performance. We test 9 state-of-the-art ML algorithms to find the most effective algorithm for modeling intraurban PM2.5 variations and we explore the relative importance of all sets of factors on intraurban air quality model performance. Results demonstrate that Gaussian-kernel support vector regression (SVR) was the most effective ML algorithm tested, improving accuracy by 118% compared to a traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) approach. Incorporating the enhanced approach with SVR algorithm increased model performance up to 18.4% for yearlong and 98.7% for month-long hourly datasets, respectively. Incorporating assumptions for human occupancy patterns in dominant building typologies resulted in improvements in model performance by between 4% and 37%. Combined, these innovations can be used to improve the performance and accuracy of urban air quality prediction models compared to conventional approaches.

Accurate air quality prediction can provide useful information for government decision-making and residents' activities. However, accurately predicting future air quality remains a challenging task because of the complex spatial-temporal dependencies of air quality. Previous studies failed to explicitly model these spatial-temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive spatial-temporal network (SA-STNet) to efficiently and effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of air quality. In order to effectively aggregate spatial information, we employ a self-adaptive graph convolution module that can learn the latent spatial correlations of air quality automatically. In the temporal dimension, we utilise three independent components to capture the recent, daily-periodic, and weekly-periodic temporal dependencies of air quality, respectively. In addition, our model exploits rich external complementary information by means of a features extraction component. A parametric-matrix-based fusion architecture is used to combine the outputs of different components into a joint representation which is used for generating the final prediction results. Extensive experiments carried out on real-world datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model compared with baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Further, the key factors controlling the space-time variablity of HONO concentrations were analyzed based on variable importance values. The ensemble model well characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of daily HONO concentrations with the sampled-based, site-based and by-year cross-validation (CV) R2 (RMSE) of 0.7 (0.36 ppbv), 0.67 (0.36 ppbv), and 0.62 (0.40 ppbv), respectively.

The national HONO levels stagnated during 2006Â2013, then declined after 2013 benefiting from the implementation of the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control. The NO3? concentration, urban area, NO2 column density ranked as important variables for HONO prediction, while agricultral land, forest and grassland played minor roles in affecting HONO concentrations, suggesting the significant role of heterogeneous HONO production from anthropogenic precursor emissions.

Therefore, accurate prediction of air quality is crucial for mitigation planning to support urban sustainability and resilience. Although some studies have predicted air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) using machine learning algorithms (MLAs), there is a paucity of studies on spatial hazard assessment with respect to the air quality index (AQI). Incorporating PM in AQI studies is crucial because of its easily inhalable micro-size which has adverse impacts on ecology, environment, and human health. Accurate and timely prediction of the air quality index can ensure adequate intervention to aid air quality management. Therefore, this study undertakes a spatial hazard assessment of the air quality index using particulate matter with a diameter of 10 ?m or lesser (PM10) in Selangor, Malaysia, by developing four machine learning models: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB). Spatially processed data such as NDVI, SAVI, BU, LST, Ws, slope, elevation, and road density was used for the modelling. The model was trained with 70% of the dataset, while 30% was used for cross-validation. Results showed that XGBoost has the highest overall accuracy and precision of 0.989 and 0.995, followed by random forest (0.989, 0.993), K-nearest neighbour (0.987, 0.984), and Naive Bayes (0.917, 0.922), respectively. The spatial air quality maps were generated by integrating the geographical information system (GIS) with the four MLAs, which correlated with MalaysiaÂs air pollution index. The maps indicate that air quality in Selangor is satisfactory and posed no threats to health. Nevertheless, the two algorithms with the best performance (XGBoost and RF) indicate that a high percentage of the air quality is moderate. The study concludes that successful air pollution management policies such as green infrastructure practice, improvement of energy efficiency, and restrictions on heavy-duty vehicles can be adopted in Selangor and other Southeast Asian cities to prevent deterioration of air quality in the future.

However, it is difficult to predict the degree of air pollution of a location by exploiting massive air pollution datasets incorporating data on spatially related locations. Construction of a spatial correlation prediction model for air pollution is therefore required for air pollution big-data mining. In this paper, we propose an air pollution-concentration spatial correlation prediction model based on a fusion deep neural network called FDN-learning. Three models are combined: a stacked anti-autoencoder network, Gaussian function model, and long short-term memory network (LSTM). The FDN-learning model is composed of three layers for feature expansion, intermediate processing, and data prediction. In the first layer, we employ a stacked anti-autoencoder model to learn the source-data spatial features through a feature expansion hidden layer; this can enrich the feature vector and mine more information for further prediction. In the second layer, the Gaussian function evaluates effective weights for the outputs of the stacked anti-autoencoder models in the preceding layer; the spatial correction effects are therefore incorporated in this layer. Finally, the LSTM model in the data prediction layer learns the air pollution-concentration temporal features. A fine-tuning method based on stochastic gradient descent is applied to the FDN-learning model for improved performance. Empirical results are used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed model based on a real-world air pollution dataset.

Many of the models were developed for criteria air pollutants rather than others that have not been regulated (e.g., ultrafine particles, black carbon, and benzene) which may also be harmful to human health. We aim to develop spatial models for regulated and non-regulated air pollutants using 6 algorithms and compare their prediction performances. A mobile platform with fast-response monitors was used to measure gaseous air pollutants (nitrogen dioxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxides, ozone, benzene, toluene, methanol) and particulate matters (black carbon, surface area, count- and volume-concentrations of ultrafine particles) in Beijing, China for 30 days from July to October 2008. Mobile monitoring data for model building were spatially aggregated into 130 road segments of approximately 600-m interval on the sampling routes after temporal adjustment of background concentrations. The best models for the air pollutants were dominated by traffic variables, which explained more than 60% of the spatial variations (range: 0.61 for methanol to 0.88 for ozone) based on the highest cross-validation R2 and the lowest root mean square error among different algorithms. Amongst the 6 algorithms, the spatial models using partial least squares regression (PLS, a dimension reduction algorithm) and random forest (RF, a machine learning algorithm) algorithms outperformed the models with other algorithms. Exposure predictions from the best models varied substantially with distinct spatial patterns between the air pollutants. Predictions with multiple modeling algorithms were moderately correlated with each other for the same pollutant at the fine-scale grids across the city. Exposure models, especially based on PLS and RF algorithms, captured the spatial variation of short-term average concentrations, had adequate predictive validity, and could be applied to assess toxic air pollutant exposures in human health studies.

We use high-resolution remote-sensing satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard the NASA Terra+Aqua satellites and remote-sensing data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), a multispectral imaging spectrometer onboard the Sentinel-5P satellite. We use the highly correlated Fire Radiative Power data product from the MODIS instrument which provides valuable information about the radiant heat output and effects of wildfires on atmospheric air pollutants. The input data we use in our deep-learning model is representative of the major sources of ground-level PM2.5 and thus we can predict hourly PM2.5 at unparalleled accuracies.

Accurate prediction of air pollutant concentration can more effectively control and prevent air pollution. In this study, a big data correlation principle and deep learning technology are used for a proposed model of predicting PM2.5 concentration. The model comprises a deep learning network model based on a residual neural network (ResNet) and a convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network (ConvLSTM). ResNet is used to deeply extract the spatial distribution features of pollutant concentration and meteorological data from multiple cities. The output is used as input to ConvLSTM, which further extracts the preliminary spatial distribution features extracted from the ResNet, while extracting the spatiotemporal features of the pollutant concentration and meteorological data. The model combines the two features to achieve a spatiotemporal correlation of feature sequences, thereby accurately predicting the future PM2.5 concentration of the target city for a period of time. Compared with other neural network models and traditional models, the proposed pollutant concentration prediction model improves the accuracy of predicting pollutant concentration. For 1- to 3-hours prediction tasks, the proposed pollutant concentration prediction model performed well and exhibited root mean square error (RMSE) between 5.478 and 13.622.

This work focuses to study the inadvertent effect of COVID-19 lockdown on air pollution. Pollutants' concentration before- and during- COVID-19 lockdown is captured to understand the variation in air quality. Firstly, multi-pollutant profiling using hierarchical cluster analysis of pollutants' concentration is performed that highlights the differences in the cluster compositions between before- and during-lockdown time periods. Results show that the particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) in air that formed the primary cluster before lock-down, came down to close similarity with other clusters during lockdown. Secondly, predicting air quality index (AQI) based on the forecasts of pollutants' concentration is performed using neural networks, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and boosting algorithms. The best-fitted models representing AQI is identified separately for before- and during-lockdown time periods based on its predictive power. While deterministic method reactively evaluates present AQI when current pollutants' concentration at a particular time and place are known, this study uses the best fitted data-driven model to determine future AQIs based on the forecasts of pollutant's concentration accurately (overall RMSE<0.1 for before lockdown scenario and <0.3 for during lockdown scenario). The study contributes to visualize the variation in pollutants' concentrations between the two scenarios. The results show that the reduced economic activities during lockdown period had led to the drop in concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 by 27% and 50% on an average.

It is necessary to establish an accurate PM2.5 concentration prediction system for urban air monitoring and control. Due to the nonlinear characteristics of PM2.5 concentration, it is difficult to predict it directly. Therefore, a novel hybrid model for PM2.5 concentration based on improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD), outlier-robust extreme learning machine (ORELM) optimized by hybrid cuckoo search (CS), and chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA), error correction (EC) is proposed named IVMD-ChOACS-ORELM-EC. First of all, an improved VMD based on energy loss coefficient, named IVMD, is proposed. IVMD decomposes the original data to obtain K IMF components. Then, a hybrid optimization algorithm based on ChOA improved by CS is proposed, named ChOACS. The hybrid optimization algorithm is used to optimize ORELM. On this basis, the prediction model ChOACS-ORELM is proposed, and the K IMF components are predicted by ChOACS-ORELM. Finally, the EC model based on decomposition ensemble is established to further improve the prediction accuracy. The PM2.5 concentration data collected at hourly intervals in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Qingdao in China are used as experimental data.

To mitigate particulate air pollution, the Chinese government has been implementing a series of clean air actions. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on surface air pollutants data obtained from the China air quality observation network using a random forest (RF) approach, to evaluate the impact of clean air actions on aerosol pollution from 2015 to 2022. Overall, the observed PM2.5 and PM10 showed evidently decreasing trends during 2015–2022 in each season, with the largest trends in winter. Based on the RF model analysis, we further quantified the seasonal-dependent trends in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations driven by anthropogenic emissions over China, which were approximately −3.84 and −6.14, −2.82 and −4.71, −2.58 and −4.45, and −2.77 and −4.06 μg m−³ yr−1 for winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. Furthermore, anthropogenic emissions were estimated to contribute 34.44 and 54.98, 24.10 and 37.22, 23.48 and 36.20, and 21.04 and 30.69 μg m−3 to declines in annual mean PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations during the eight years in megacity clusters of eastern China for winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. These seasonal-dependent trend analyses reveal the largest reduction in ambient aerosol pollution due to anthropogenic emission abatements during cold season and further demonstrate substantial effectiveness of the clean air actions for improvement in particulate air quality in China. Correlation analysis on PM2.5 with the major meteorological parameters and the RF model built-in feature importance suggested that a combination of high relative humidity, shallow boundary layer heights, and low wind speeds could promote wintertime aerosol pollution in short-time scales over northern China (e.g., the North China plain). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Applied Geochemistry,10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105614,5,5,Yes,RF,,Yes,"China,United States",analysis,"PM25,PM10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies mainly focused on the variation of PM2.5 concentrations during daytime rather than nighttime. In addition, assessing the spatial variations of PM2.5 in large areas is a critical issue for environmental epidemiological studies to clarify the health effects from PM2.5 exposures. In terms of air pollution spatial modelling, using only a single model might lose information in capturing spatial and temporal correlation between predictors and pollutant levels. Hence, this study aimed to propose an ensemble mixed spatial model that incorporated Kriging interpolation, land-use regression (LUR), machine learning, and stacking ensemble approach to estimate long-term PM2.5 variations for nearly three decades in daytime and nighttime. Three steps of model development were applied: 1) linear based LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR were used to determine influential predictors; 2) machine learning algorithms were used to enhance model prediction accuracy; 3) predictions from the selected machine learning models were fitted and evaluated again to build the final ensemble mixed spatial model. The results showed that prediction performance increased from 0.514 to 0.895 for daily, 0.478 to 0.879 for daytime, and 0.523 to 0.878 for nighttime when applying the proposed ensemble mixed spatial model compared with LUR. Results of overfitting test and extrapolation ability test confirmed the robustness and reliability of the developed models. The distance to the nearest thermal power plant, density of soil and pebbles fields, and funeral facilities might affect the variation of PM2.5 levels between daytime and nighttime.

Hence, this work employs Sentinel 5P imagery and a novel artificial intelligence model for predicting air pollution in Kiev. A well-known machine learning (ML) model, namely, multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), is coupled with electromagnetic field optimization (EFO) algorithm to predict the daily concentration of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). Initially, a dataset is prepared by collecting 11 meteorological, atmospheric, and temporal factors from remote sensing and ground measurements. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to determine the most contributive factors and create a reduced dataset. Four scenarios are defined by considering the reduced/original dataset, along with, predicting the current day/one-day-ahead PM2.5. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the most accurate results were achieved for predicting one-day-ahead PM2.5 using the reduced dataset. After adjusting the EFO-MLPNN hybrid model, its performance is compared to classical MLPNN and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). According to the results, the EFO-MLPNN with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.68 μ g ċ m-3 and Pearson correlation coefficient ( RP ) of 0.82 outperformed both MLPNN and ANFIS outcomes. These findings infer that by optimizing the MLPNN by EFO, its prediction accuracy can be improved. The proposed hybrid model is therefore recommended for more practical air quality estimation and decision-making in the studied site.

There is an urgent need for a spatial-temporal prediction model for characterizing PM2.5 chemical compositions to assess exposure risks and develop effective air pollutants reduction strategies. In this study, the spatial-temporal variations of NO3? and SO42? were characterized using a hybrid multi-step ahead neural network (MSA-NN)/Kriging model in the urban areas with limited PM2.5 constituents monitoring stations. A meteorological normalization technique was further applied to develop a de-weather model to investigate temporal variations of air pollutants during the level 3 COVID-19 alert in central Taiwan. The MSA-NN algorithm could predict 94% and 91% of NO3? and SO42?, respectively, at the t+1-time horizon predictions. Based on the predicted results using the present de-weather model, the reduction in primary emissions attributed to the impact of COVID-19 during the level 3 alert was found to dominate the temporal air pollutant concentrations in central Taiwan. The present model could provide applicable and accurate high resolution of spatial-temporal NO3? and SO42? datasets in an area with limited PM2.5 chemical composition measurement. The present model could also be potentially applied to facilitate hotspot identification and human exposure assessment.

Prediction of air quality plays a crucial role in warning people about the air quality levels. With the help of this, we can make the proper mechanism for reducing the overall impact of bad air quality on individualsÂ health. In this paper, we are focused on developing a mechanistic and quantitative prediction model for the prediction of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and Air Pollutant Concentration (NOx) levels with a clear environmental interpretation. The proposed model is based on the Linear Regression based Recursive Feature Elimination with Random Forest Regression (RFERF). For the experimental analysis, the seven well-established machine learning models have been taken, and these models are compared with our proposed model to find out their suitability and correctness. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2 score) have been used to validate the performance of prediction models. For the prediction of AQI and NOx, the data of the Central Pollution Control Board of India has been taken. The proposed model performs superior as compared to other prediction models with better accuracy and a higher prediction rate.

As one of the main components of air pollutants, accurate prediction of PM2.5 can provide a reference for air pollution control and pollution warning. This study proposes an air pollutant prediction and early warning framework, which innovatively combines feature extraction techniques, feature selection methods and intelligent optimization algorithms. First, the PM2.5 sequence is decomposed into several subsequences using the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, and then the new components of the subsequences with different complexity are reconstructed using fuzzy entropy. Then, the Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy method is used to select the influencing factors of the different reconstructed components. Then, a two-stage deep learning hybrid framework is constructed to model the prediction and nonlinear integration of the reconstructed components using a long short-term memory artificial neural network optimized by the gray wolf optimization algorithm. Finally, based on the proposed hybrid prediction framework, effective prediction and early warning of air pollutants are achieved. In an empirical study in three cities in China, the prediction accuracy, warning accuracy and prediction stability of the proposed hybrid framework outperformed the other comparative models. The analysis results indicate that the developed hybrid framework can be used as an effective tool for air pollutant prediction and early warning.

As a significant indicator of air quality, PM2.5 concentration has long been proven to be affecting the population's death rate. Machine learning algorithms proven to outperform traditional statistical approaches are widely used in air pollution prediction. However research on the model selection discussion and environmental interpretation of model prediction results is still scarce and urgently needed to lead the policy making on air pollution control. Our research compared four types of machine learning algorisms LinearSVR, K-Nearest Neighbor, Lasso regression, Gradient boosting by looking into their performance in predicting PM2.5 concentrations among different cities and seasons. The results show that the machine learning model is able to forecast the next day PM2.5 concentration based on the previous five days' data with better accuracy. The comparative experiments show that based on city level the Gradient Boosting prediction model has better prediction performance with mean absolute error (MAE) of 9 ug/m3 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.25Â16.76 ug/m3, lower compared with the other three models, and based on season level four models have the best prediction performances in winter time and the worst in summer time.

The situation has reached such an alarming situation that knowing the extent of air pollution well in advance has become an absolute necessity before we step out of our home. An advance prediction can help the urban travellers to know the possibility of enhanced pollution ahead of time at strategic locations of a city and thereby be useful in planning a less polluted route. Different cities of the world have pollutants levels with varied dispersion pattern. As a result, a generic prediction model is needed that can cater to all types of pollutants and which can offer better forecasts of pollution data irrespective of their dispersion levels. In this paper, the authors modelled recurrent neural network (RNN)-based bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) that forecasts pollutants concentration with least RMSE. The model is trained and tested on the pollution data of Delhi, the most polluted capital city in the world for the second consecutive year in 2019.

In this study, we employ a mobile monitoring method to collect PM2.5 and BC data in the city of Philadelphia, PA during the summer of 2019 and apply the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) methodology to examine relationships between urban structure and atmospheric pollution. We find that PM2.5 and BC vary by STURLA class, and some classes exhibit significant difference in pollution concentrations. We also find that the proportions in which STURLA components are present throughout the urban landscape can be used to predict the spatial distribution of urban air pollution.

Accurate estimation of O3 exposure requires the ability to monitor O3 surface concentration with a high spatiotemporal resolution. Several spatiotemporal land use regression (LUR) models have integrated meteorological factors based on different statistical algorithms to support such epidemiological studies. From among such various existing statistical algorithms, we aim to identify a high-efficiency modeling method, as well as the most suitable lengths of the modeling period (time scale). Three types of typical spatiotemporal LUR models based on parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric statistic methods, respectively, are considered to predict daily ground-level O3 in the megacity of Tianjin, China. Based on monthly, seasonal (cold and warm), and annual time scales, these models include: a series of monthly hybrid LUR (Two-stage) models consisting of two sub-models based on the multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithm, general additive mixed models (GAMMs), and land use random forest (LURF) models. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to evaluate the temporal and spatial predictive accuracy of each model using the adjusted coefficient of determination (adjR2CV) and root mean square error (RMSECV). In the GAMMs and LURF models, models using a shorter time scale (monthly models) outperformed those using a longer one. In monthly models, the GAMMs performed the best, with the highest average adjR2CV (0.747) and the lowest average RMSECV (15.721 ?g/m3), followed by the LURF models (average adjR2CV = 0.695, average RMSECV = 16.405), and the Two-stage models (average adjR2CV = 0.466, average RMSECV = 23.934). Thus, the modeling format consisting of a shorter time scale and the GAMM algorithm performs relatively well in predicting daily O3 pollution on a megacity scale. These findings can be used to select appropriate modeling methods for epidemiological research of O3 pollution.

Atmospheric pollution forecasting can provide effective information for controlling atmospheric pollution, so this research proposes a CEEMD-MR-Hybrid model for SO2 forecasting, which employs CEEMD, machine learning models (CNN, PSOSVR, PSOBP) and mode refactor system (MR). The main feature of proposed model is to reconstruct the decomposed series using MR including random forest and sample entropy for hybrid forecasting. Sample entropy can combine decomposed series with similar characteristics by measuring the complexity of distinct decomposed series. Random forest can obtain decomposed sub-sequences high correlated with the original sequence by ranking characteristics importance. Five geographically diverse cities in China are selected to test the validation of the proposed model. Compared with previous CEEMD-RN-Hybrid models, the results of proposed hybrid models have higher consistency with actual data. Therefore, the innovative model can be utilized as an effective model for SO2 forecasting. Taking Shenzhen as an example, the MAPE values of all CEEMD-MR-Hybrid models are smaller than 10% for SO2 forecasting. Therefore, the innovative model provides a machine learning system which can efficiently refactor the decomposition series to improve the accuracy for hybrid model.

Accurate prediction of PM2.5 can help taking preventive measures for reducing air pollution. The periodic pattern of PM2.5 can be modeled with recurrent neural networks to predict air quality. To the best of the authorÂs knowledge, very limited work has been conducted on the coupling of missing value imputation methods with gated recurrent unit (GRU) for the prediction of PM2.5 concentration of Guangzhou City, China. This paper proposes the combination of project to model plane (PMP) with GRU for the superior prediction performance of PM2.5 concentration of Guangzhou City, China. Initially, outperforming the missing value imputation method PMP is proposed for air quality data under consideration by making a comparison study on various methods such as KDR, TSR, IA, NIPALS, DA, and PMP. Secondly, it presents GRU in combination with PMP to show its superiority on other machine learning techniques such as LSSVM and two other RNN variants, LSTM and Bi-LSTM. For this study, data for Guangzhou City were collected from ChinaÂs governmental air quality website. Data contained daily values of PM2.5, PM10, O3, SOx, NOx, and CO. This study has employed RMSE, MAPE, and MEDAE as model prediction performance criteria. Comparison of prediction performance criteria on the test data showed GRU in combination with PMP has outperformed the LSSVM and other RNN variants LSTM and Bi-LSTM for Guangzhou City, China. In comparison with prediction performance of LSSVM, GRU improved the prediction performance on test data by 40.9% RMSE, 48.5% MAPE, and 50.4% MEDAE.

Most machine-learning models have aimed to predict 24 h-averaged PM2.5 concentrations (mean PM2.5) in high-income regions. Over Mexico, none have been developed to predict subdaily peak levels, such as the maximum daily 1-h concentration (max PM2.5). Objective: Our goal was to develop a machine-learning model to predict mean PM2.5 and max PM2.5 concentrations in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area from 2004 through 2019. Methods: We present a new modeling approach based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and inverse-distance weighting that uses AOD, meteorology, and land-use variables. We also investigated applications of our mean PM2.5 predictions that can aid local authorities in air-quality management and public-health surveillance, such as the co-occurrence of high PM2.5 and heat, compliance with local air-quality standards, and the relationship of PM2.5 exposure with social marginalization. Results: Our models for mean and max PM2.5 exhibited good performance, with overall cross-validated mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.68 and 9.20 ?g/m3, respectively, compared to mean absolute deviations from the median (MAD) of 8.55 and 15.64 ?g/m3. In 2010, everybody in the study region was exposed to unhealthy levels of PM2.5. Hotter days had greater PM2.5 concentrations. Finally, we found similar exposure to PM2.5 across levels of social marginalization. Significance: Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict highly spatiotemporally resolved PM2.5 concentrations even in regions with sparse monitoring. Impact: Our PM2.5 predictions can aid local authorities in air-quality management and public-health surveillance, and they can advance epidemiological research in Central Mexico with state-of-the-art exposure assessment methods.

To inform people about the air quality in their living areas, it is essential to measure the extent of pollution in the atmosphere. Air pollution sensors are assembled at static, fixed-site measurement monitoring stations to acquire data. The data can be processed at the fixed stations or transmitted to the server to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI). Some previous studies applied machine learning algorithms to predict the AQI. Even though those works showed good performance on specific data, the results are not consistent on different datasets. Moreover, to serve the need for low-cost AQI tracking and prediction, lightweight machine learning algorithms can be directly integrated into microcontroller hardware systems. This study proposed a new method that combines (i) air pollution data processing techniques and (ii) lightweight machine learning algorithms to enhance the AQI predicting performance. Three algorithms, namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were compared via three evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, and R2 to propose the best model in AQI prediction. Two different public datasets, which were both collected in different regions in India were used to verify our proposed method. XGBoost outperformed in predicting the AQI values. Thus, XGBoost is selected for the low-cost AQI prediction device assembled at fixed-site measurement stations.

It contributes to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases, and adversely impacts the health of billions of people. Despite its importance, detailed information about the spatial and temporal distribution of pollutants is complex to obtain. Ground-level monitoring stations are sparse, and approaches for modeling air pollution rely on extensive datasets which are unavailable for many locations. We introduce three techniques for the estimation of air pollution to overcome these limitations: 1) a baseline localized approach that mimics conventional land-use regression through gradient boosting; 2) an OpenStreetMap (OSM) approach with gradient boosting that is applicable beyond regions covered by detailed geographic datasets; and 3) a remote sensing-based deep learning method utilizing multiband imagery and trace-gas column density measurements from satellites. We focus on the estimation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a common anthropogenic air pollutant with adverse effects on the environment and human health. Our local baseline model achieves strong results with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.18 Â± $0.16~\mu ext {g/m}^{3}$ NO2. Substituting localized inputs with OSM leads to a degraded performance (MAE 7.22 Â± 0.14) but enables NO2 estimation at a global scale. The proposed deep learning model on remote sensing data combines high accuracy (MAE 5.5 Â± 0.14) with global coverage and heteroscedastic uncertainty quantification. Our results enable the estimation of surface-level NO2 pollution with high spatial resolution for any location on Earth.

This is due to continuous usage of fossil fuel energy resources generating air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), which impact on climate and air quality and adversely affect the human health. The present paper aims at training an ensemble of forecasting methodologies for traffic-induced pollutant emissions and implementing it for predicting PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 for the case study of Cambridge, UK inner-city region. Such an ensemble enables decision makers to evaluate the impact of various transportation policies and measures on human health and the ecosystem, and subsequently contribute towards urban resilience and sustainability. Since the chemical synthesis of air pollution is triggered by meteorological factors, the forecasting incorporates them along with the traffic volumes.

Accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration is very important for air pollution monitoring and public health management. However, the presence of noise in PM2.5 data series is a major challenge of its accurate prediction. A novel hybrid PM2.5 concentration prediction model is proposed in this study by combining complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) method, PearsonÂs correlation analysis, and a deep long short-term memory (LSTM) method. CEEMD was employed to decompose historical PM2.5 concentration data to different frequencies in order to enhance the timing characteristics of data. PearsonÂs correlation was used to screen the different frequency intrinsic-mode functions of decomposed data. Finally, the filtered enhancement data were inputted to a deep LSTM network with multiple hidden layers for training and prediction. The results evidenced the potential of the CEEMD-LSTM hybrid model with a prediction accuracy of approximately 80% and model convergence after 700 training epochs. The secondary screening of PearsonÂs correlation test improved the model (CEEMD-Pearson) accuracy up to 87% but model convergence after 800 epochs. The hybrid model combining CEEMD-Pearson with the deep LSTM neural network showed a prediction accuracy of nearly 90% and model convergence after 650 interactions. The results provide a clear indication of higher prediction accuracy of PM2.5 with less computation time through hybridization of CEEMD-Pearson with deep LSTM models and its potential to be employed for air pollution monitoring.

We infer concentrations of multiple pollutants within one integrated learning network, which is applied to and evaluated on a case study in Chengdu (4900 km2, 26 April - 12 June 2019), where air pollutant (PM2.5, PM10 and O3) measurements from 40 monitoring sites are used to train the network to estimate pollutant concentrations in 4900 grid-cells (1 km2). The Multi-AP learning network allows us to estimate highly-resolved (1 km Ã 1 km, hourly) air pollution maps based on pollutant measurements which cover less than 1% of the grid-cells with better accuracy compared to other approaches, and with significant computational efficiency improvements. The time-cost is 1/3 of the time-cost of modelling each pollutant individually. Furthermore, we evaluate the relative importance of features and find that the meteorological feature set is the most important followed the land use features.

Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is presented to capture the complex spatio-temporal relation of the dynamic biased meteorological data. Residual learning is designed to avoid unpredictable oscillations when training the network and verifying errors. For the issue of characteristic statistical migration and saddle point proliferation in deep network, the orthogonality regularizations are designed to stabilize the back-propagation errors, utilizing various advanced analytical tools such as restricted isometry property without extra hassle. We then benchmark their effects on public real-world datasets to demonstrate that ST-OR-ResNet has better predictive performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

This study aims to create O3 isopleths in urban and suburban environments, based on machine learning with air quality data collected from 2001 to 2017 at urban (EA) and suburban (CC) monitoring stations from Madrid (Spain). Artificial neural network (ANN) models have powerful fitting performance, describing correctly several complex and nonlinear relationships such as O3 and his precursors (VOC and NOx). Also, ANN learns from the experience provided by data, contrary to mechanistic models based on the fundamental laws of natural sciences. The determined isopleths showed a different behaviour of the VOC-NOx-O3 system compared to the one achieved with a mechanistic model (EKMA curve): e.g. for constant NOx concentrations, O3 concentrations decreased with VOC concentrations in the ANN model. Considering the difficulty to model all the phenomena (and acquired all the required data) that influences O3 concentrations, the statistical models may be a solution to describe this system correctly. The applied methodology is a valuable tool for defining mitigation strategies (control of precursorsÂ emissions) to reduce O3 concentrations.

As such, efforts to predict the evolution and estimate statistically significant effects of covariates related to this air pollutant are recommended. Bayesian, econometrics and machine learning models are applied to predict future values of sulfur dioxide emissions in the vicinity of the most relevant thermoelectric power plant located in Portugal. Based on a multivariate time series analysis containing data that ranges from July 2017 to April 2020, several conclusions are identified. Predicted values of sulfur dioxide emissions of the five models exhibiting the lowest forecast error are strongly correlated, particularly in the interval 0.35Â±0.10?g/m3. The application of multi-step ahead forecasting analysis and nonlinear ensemble algorithms reinforces the main result from the one-step ahead forecasting exercise, where it is demonstrated that machine learning models have a better generalization power compared to classical approaches. Additionally, an identification strategy is proposed to assess the efficacy of a firm-specific measure adopted in 2017 (i.e., qualitative improvement of the desulfurization process to reduce the level of sulfur dioxide emissions). Super learning algorithms confirm that sulfur dioxide emissions in 2017 were approximately 19% greater relative to the period 2018Â2020, which allows to conclude that the effort promoted by the firm was effective. From a regulatory point of view, this study confirms that Portugal is likely to satisfy 2030 targets imposed by supranational regulation for sulfur dioxide emissions and provides useful recommendations to ensure the persistence of best air quality sustainability practices.

Shipping emissions have been identified as a source of air pollution; therefore, it is necessary to predict air pollutant concentrations to manage seaport air quality. However, air pollution prediction models rarely consider shipping emissions. Here, the PM2.5 concentrations of the Busan North and Busan New Ports were predicted using a recurrent neural network and long short-term memory model by employing the shipping activity data of Busan Port. In contrast to previous studies that employed only air quality and meteorological data as input data, our model considered shipping activity data as an emission source. The model was trained from 1 January 2019 to 31 January 2020 and predictions and verifications were performed from 1Â28 February 2020. Verifications revealed an index of agreements (IOA) of 0.975 and 0.970 and root mean square errors of 4.88 and 5.87 Âµg/m3 for Busan North Port and Busan New Port, respectively. Regarding the results based on the activity data, a previous study reported an IOA of 0.62Â0.84, with a higher predictive power of 0.970Â0.975.

The meteorological (daily average precipitation, pressure, relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed, daily maximum wind speed and sunshine hours on the same day) and air pollutant data (daily PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3 concentrations on the previous day) in January and August of each year from 2015 to 2019 were used as candidate inputs. The optimal member and combining models were evaluated through the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), fivefold cross-validation, and hold-out methods. Twelve member models with optimal or sub-optimal performance were further used to develop the combining models. The performances of the BPANN and MLR member models were different using three data division methods. The models were evaluated more comprehensively through the LOOCV. The performances of the combining models were generally better than the member models. For both member and combining models, the PM2.5 forecasting model performance in August was generally better than in January. The correlation coefficient (R) for the validation set of the optimal combination model was about 0.87 in January and 0.946 in August.

Governed by emission characteristics and meteorological conditions, the formation and destruction of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) are complicated, and accurate predictions of the concentrations of these two major secondary atmospheric pollutants remain challenging. In this study, by combining meteorological and air pollutant data from ground observations and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations, a deep learning model structure based on long short-term memory layers (LSTM) was developed and applied to predict the PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the future 48 h period. The forecasting improvement was extended to the whole Greater Bay Area by introducing a spatial correction (SC) method to the CMAQ simulation results. Compared with the original CMAQ forecast, the new method gained a 26% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and a 33% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE), respectively, in terms of PM2.5; it also achieved a 40% reduction in MAE and a 34% reduction in RMSE in terms of O3.

When it exceeds the standard value, it is considered to cause pollution and lower the air quality, which is harmful to human health and can cause a variety of diseases, i.e., asthma, chronic bronchitis, etc. Therefore, the prediction of PM2.5 concentration is helpful to reduce its harm. In this paper, a hybrid model called CNN-BiLSTM-Attention is proposed to predict the PM2.5 concentration over the next two days. First, we select the PM2.5 concentration data in hours from January 2013 to February 2017 of Shunyi District, Beijing. The auxiliary data includes air quality data and meteorological data. We use the sliding window method for preprocessing and dividing the corresponding data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. Second, CNN-BiLSTM-Attention is composed of the convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory neural network, and attention mechanism. The parameters of this network structure are determined by the minimum error in the training process, including the size of the convolution kernel, activation function, batch size, dropout rate, learning rate, etc. We determine the feature size of the input and output by evaluating the performance of the model, finding out the best output for the next 48 h. Third, in the experimental part, we use the test set to check the performance of the proposed CNN-BiLSTM-Attention on PM2.5 prediction, which is compared by other comparison models, i.e., lasso regression, ridge regression, XGBOOST, SVR, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM. We conduct short-term prediction (48 h) and long-term prediction (72 h, 96 h, 120 h, 144 h), respectively.

Two-week integrated measurements of PM1.0 (median aerodiameter &lt; 1.0 ?m) were collected at 50 sampling sites during fall (2010), winter (2011), and summer (2011) in the Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada. PM1.0 filters were analyzed for metals and trace elements using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. OLS- and RF-LUR models were developed for approximately 30 PM1.0 trace elements in each season. Model predictors included industrial, commercial, and institutional/ government/ military land use, roadways, shipping, other transportation sources, and wind rose information. RF generated more accurate models than OLS for most trace elements based on 5-fold cross validation. On average, summer models had the highest cross validation R2 (OLS-LUR = 0.40, RF-LUR = 0.46), while fall had the lowest (OLS-LUR = 0.27, RF-LUR = 0.31). Many OLS-LUR models displayed overprediction in the final exposure surface. In contrast, RF-LUR models did not exhibit overpredictions. Taking overpredictions and cross validation performances into account, OLS-LUR performed better than RF-LUR in roughly 20% of the seasonal trace element models. RF-LUR models provided more interpretable predictors in most cases. Seasonal predictors varied, likely due to differences in seasonal distribution of trace elements related to source activity, and meteorology.

However, owing to the complexity and differences in spatiotemporal changes for various types of pollution, it is challenging to establish a framework that can capture the spatiotemporal correlations of different types of air pollution and obtain high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning framework suitable for predicting various air pollutants: a graph convolutional temporal sliding long short-term memory (GT-LSTM) model. The hybrid integrated model combines graph convolutional networks and long short-term networks based on a strategy with temporal sliding. Herein, the graph convolution networks gather neighbor information for spatial dependency modeling based on the spatial adjacency matrices of different pollutants and the graph convolution operator with parameter sharing. LSTM networks with a temporal sliding strategy are used to learn dynamic air pollution changes for temporal dependency modeling. The framework was applied to predict the average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, O3, CO, SO2, and NO2 in the Bejing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region for the next 24Â hours.

To improve the forecast accuracy, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on two-stage decomposition embedded sample entropy, group teaching optimization algorithm (GTOA), and extreme learning machine (ELM) to forecast the concentration of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). First, the improvement complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) is employed to decompose the concentration data of PM10 and PM2.5 into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different frequencies. In addition, wavelet transform (WT) is utilized to decompose the IMFs with high frequency based on sample entropy values. Then the GTOA algorithm is used to optimize ELM. Furthermore, the GTOA-ELM is utilized to predict all the subseries. The final forecast result is obtained by ensemble of the forecast results of all subseries. To further prove the predictable performance of the hybrid approach on air pollutants, the hourly concentration data of PM2.5 and PM10 are used to make one-step-, two-step-and three-step-ahead predictions.

To provide more accurate early warning information for acid rain prevention, urban planning, and travel planning, a novel air pollutant prediction model was proposed in this paper to predict NO2 and SO2. First, the data were decomposed into several sub-sequences by a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Second, the subsequences are reconstructed by variational mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, the new subsequences are predicted by the extreme learning machine combined with the whale optimization algorithm. The empirical analysis was carried out through 8 data sets. According to the experimental results, three main conclusions can be drawn. First, the proposed model in this paper has excellent prediction performance and robustness. In all the comparison experiments, the R2 and RMSE of the proposed model are the best among all the models. Second, data preprocessing is very necessary. After adding the decomposition algorithm, the average improvement levels of R2 and RMSE were 897.57% and 50.78%, respectively. Third, the re-decomposition of IMF1 is an effective method to improve prediction accuracy. After the re-decomposition of IMF1, R2 can be improved by 13.64% on average on the original basis, and RMSE can be reduced by 31.99% on average. The results of this study can provide a valuable reference for the research of air pollutant prediction. In future work, the application of the proposed model in other air pollutants or other regions can be explored.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of monthly mean daily maximum 8-h average O-3 concentrations in China from 2005 to 2019 at a 0.05 degrees spatial resolution. METHODS: We developed a machine learning model with a satellite-derived boundary-layer O-3 column, O-3 precursors, meteorological conditions, land-use information, and proxies of anthropogenic emissions as predictors. RESULTS: The random, spatial, and temporal cross-validation R-2 of our model were 0.87, 0.86, and 0.76, respectively. Model-predicted spatial distribution of ground-level O-3 concentrations showed significant differences across seasons. The highest summer peak of O-3 occurred in the North China Plain, whereas southern regions were the most polluted in winter. Most large urban centers showed elevated O-3 levels, but their surrounding suburban areas may have even higher O-3 concentrations owing to nitrogen oxides titration. The annual trend of O-3 concentrations fluctuated over 2005-2013, but a significant nationwide increase was observed afterward. DISCUSSION: The present model had enhanced performance in predicting ground-level O-3 concentrations in China. This national data set of O-3 concentrations would facilitate epidemiological studies to investigate the long-term health effect of O-3 in China. Our results also highlight the importance of controlling O-3 in China's next round of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan.",ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES,10.1289/ehp9406,7,4,Yes,RF,,Yes,"United States,Peoples R China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deriving ground-level NO2 concentrations with much finer resolution, it requires high-resolution satellite tropospheric NO2 column as input and a reliable estimation algorithm. This paper aims to estimate the daily ground-level NO2 concentrations over China based on machine learning models and the TROPOMI NO2 data with high spatial resolution. In this study, four tree-based algorithm machine learning models, decision trees (DT), gradient boost decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF) and extra-trees (ET), were used to estimate ground-level NO2 concentrations. In addition to considering many influencing factors of the ground-level NO2 concentrations, we especially introduced simplified temporal and spatial information into the estimation models. The results show that the extra-trees with spatial and temporal information (ST-ET) model has great performance in estimating ground-level NO2 concentrations with a cross-validation R2 of 0.81 and RMSE of 3.45 ?g/m3 in test datasets. The estimated results for 2019 based on the ST-ET model achieves a satisfactory accuracy with a cross-validation R2 of 0.86 compared with the other models. Through time-space analysis and comparison, it was found that the estimated high-resolution results were consistent with the ground observed NO2 concentrations. Using data from January 2020 to test the prediction power of the models, the results indicate that the ST-ET model has a good performance in predicting ground-level NO2 concentrations. Taking four ground-level NO2 concentrations hotspots as examples, the estimated ground-level NO2 concentrations and ground-based observation data during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic were lower compared with the same period in 2019. The findings offer a solid solution for accurately and efficiently estimating ground-level NO2 concentrations by using satellite observations, and provide useful information for improving our understanding of the regional atmospheric environment.

This study presents a novel approach using a statistical model that is trained to predict hourly concentrations of particles smaller than 10 (Formula presented.) m (PM10) by combining satellite-borne aerosol optical depth (AOD) with meteorological and land-use parameters. The model is shown to accurately predict PM10 (overall R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 7.44 ?g/m3) for measurement sites in Germany. The capability of satellite observations to map and monitor surface air pollution is assessed by investigating the relationship between AOD and PM10 in the same modeling setup. Sensitivity analyses show that important drivers of modeled PM10 include multiday mean wind flow, boundary layer height (BLH), day of year (DOY), and temperature. Different mechanisms associated with elevated PM10 concentrations are identified in winter and summer. In winter, mean predictions of PM10 concentrations &gt;35 ?g/m3 occur when BLH is below ~ 500 m. Paired with multiday easterly wind flow, mean model predictions surpass 40 ?g/m3 of PM10. In summer, PM10 concentrations seemingly are less driven by meteorology, but by emission or chemical particle formation processes, which are not included in the model. The relationship between AOD and predicted PM10 concentrations depends to a large extent on ambient meteorological conditions. Results suggest that AOD can be used to assess air quality at ground level in a machine learning approach linking it with meteorological conditions. Â©2020.

In this study, short-term prediction of PM2.5 pollution at 1, 2 and 3 hours was modelled using deep learning methods. Three deep learning algorithms and the combination thereof were evaluated: Long-short term memory units (LSTM), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Air Quality Monitoring Stations of the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization of Turkey were utilized to obtain the data. Specifically, meteorological and air pollution data were obtained from a monitoring station located in KeÃ§iÃ¶ren District of Ankara.

Most estimation methods only provide ozone products at a relatively coarse resolution, such as 5 km, but high-resolution ozone data are essential for ozone pollution prevention and control. To this end, we proposed a new framework for estimating ozone concentrations at 300 m resolution in China based on Landsat 8 infrared (IR) bands and meteorological data using a deep forest (DF) model. DF combines the excellent performance of tree integration with the expressive power of hierarchical distributed representations of neural networks. The accuracy and mapping results of DF are considerably better than some widely used machine learning methods (generalized regression neural regression network and random forest). The sample-based cross-validation (CV), station-based CV, time-based CV, and extrapolation validation show that the estimations of DF are in high agreement with the station observations with determination coefficient values of 0.938, 0.926, 0.687, and 0.660, respectively. The proposed method was used to analyze the spatial and temporal ozone variations at fine scales in three typical Chinese cities (Beijing, Wuhan and Guangzhou), where the mean ozone concentrations during the polluted season are consistent with the land use and urban heat island distribution. The rationality of ozone estimates was verified, and the advantages of high-resolution mapping was demonstrated by comparing the monitoring data from municipal controlling stations in Beijing, 10 km ozone products, and satellite images. Our product can represent spatial details and locate local pollution sources, such as temples. The proposed method has important implications for the fine-scale monitoring of ozone pollution.

In the past decade, various machine learning models, especially deep learning models, have been widely used in PM2.5 remote sensing estimation and have achieved remarkable performance. However, a typical pitfall of deep learning models is the problem of high-value underestimation, i.e., the models often underestimate high-level PM2.5 concentrations. Alleviating the problem of high-value underestimation and improving the estimation ac-curacy of high PM2.5 concentrations are crucial. This study developed a new deep learning model that combines data augmentation and a particle size constraint to improve the high-level PM2.5 estimation. Based on the re-sidual neural network (ResNet), this study used random oversampling to construct a data-augmented deep re-sidual learning model (AugResNet). In addition, a deep residual neural network model with a particle size constraint was established and called ConResNet. Then, the data augmentation and particle size constraint were incorporated into the deep residual neural network model (denoted as Aug_ConResNet). We evaluated the above four models across China with the 10-fold site-based cross-validation approach. In terms of the estimation ac-curacy for high PM2.5 concentrations (> 75 mu g/m3), AugResNet (R2 = 0.813, RMSE = 19.152 mu g/m3), ConResNet (R2 = 0.796, RMSE = 20.841 mu g/m(3)) and Aug_ConResNet (R2 = 0.820, RMSE = 18.810 mu g/m3) outperformed ResNet (R2 = 0.780, RMSE = 21.628 mu g/m3).

However, when combining meteorological conditions with other air pollutants, the prediction accuracy is higher than considering other air pollutants. In addition, the largest contribution to air quality prediction is atmospheric pressure, followed by humidity and temperature.

However, the complexity of O 3 formation mechanisms in the troposphere presents a significant challenge in modeling O 3 accurately and quickly, especially in the absence of a process model. Data-driven machine-learning techniques have demonstrated promising performance in modeling air pollution, mainly when a process model is unavailable. This study evaluates the predictive performance of nineteen machine learning models for ozone pollution prediction. Specifically, we assess how incorporating features using Random Forest affects O 3 concentration prediction and investigate using time-lagged measurements to improve prediction accuracy. Air pollution and meteorological data collected at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology are used. Results show that dynamic models using time-lagged data outperform static and reduced machine learning models. Incorporating time-lagged data improves the accuracy of machine learning models by 300% and 200%, respectively, compared to static and reduced models, under RMSE metrics.

In this study, we proposed a recurrent neural network based on a double-stage attention mechanism model to predict ozone, selected an appropriate time series for prediction through the input attention and temporal attention mechanisms, and analyzed the cause of ozone generation according to the contribution of feature parameters. The experimental data show that our model had an RMSE of 7.71 µg/m3 and a mean absolute error of 5.97 µg/m3 for 1-h predictions. The DA-RNN model predicted ozone closer to observations than the other models. Based on the importance of the characteristics, we found that the ozone pollution in the Jinshan Industrial Zone mainly comes from the emissions of petrochemical enterprises, and the good generalization performance of the model is proved through testing multiple stations.

The secondary objective of this project was to establish a relationship between air pollution and meteorological conditions. The ERA-5 data together with the NO2 TVCD product and auxiliary data were further assimilated into an artificial intelligence model in order to estimate surface NO2 concentrations. The results revealed that the random forest method was the most accurate method for estimating the surface NO2. The random forest model demonstrated MAE values of 3.4 μg/m3 (MAPE~37%) and 3.2 μg/m3 (MAPE~31%) for the hourly and weekly estimates, respectively. It was observed that the proposed model could be used for at least 120 days per year due to the cloud-free conditions. Further, it was found that the S-5P NO2 TVCD was the most important variable, which explained more than 50% of the predictions. Other important variables were the nightlights, solar radiation flux, road density, population, and planetary boundary layer height.

Ships play a significant role in coastal air pollution, in conjunction with transport mobility in the broader area of ports. As such, ports should be monitored in order to assess air pollution levels and act accordingly. In this paper, we obtain CO values from environmental sensors that were installed in the broader area of the port of Igoumenitsa in Greece. Initially, we analysed the CO values and we have identified some extreme values in the dataset that showed a potential event. Thereafter, we separated the dataset into 6-h intervals and showed that we have an extremely high rise in certain hours. We transformed the dataset to a moving average dataset, with the objective being the reduction of the extremely high values. We utilised a machine-learning algorithm, namely the univariate long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm to provide the predicted outcome of the time series from the port that has been collected.

Accurate hourly forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is thus of significant importance for public health, helping the citizens to plan the measures to alleviate the harmful effects of air pollution on health. This study analyses and discusses the temporal characteristics of PM2.5 at different locations in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam - an economic center and a megacity in a developing country with a population of 8.99 million people. We developed several AI-based one-shot multi-step PM2.5 forecasting models, with both an hourly forecast granularity (1 h to 24 h) and a 24-h rolling mean. These Machine Learning algorithms include Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor, hybrid 1D CNN-LSTM, eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Prophet. We collected the data from six monitoring stations installed by the HealthyAir project partners at different locations in HCMC, including traffic, residential and industrial areas in the city. In addition, we developed a suitable model training protocol using data from a short period to address the non-stationarity of PM2.5 time series.

High-intensity pollution emissions and unfavorable weather conditions are the key factors for the formation and development of air heavy pollution processes. Given that research into air quality prediction generally ignore pollutant emission information, in this paper, the random forest supervised learning algorithm is used to construct an air quality prediction model for Zhangdian District with industrial waste gas daily emissions and meteorological factors as variables. The training data include the air quality index (AQI) values, meteorological factors and industrial waste gas daily emission of Zhangdian District from 1st January 2017 to 30th November 2019. The data from 1st to 31th December 2019 is used as the test set to assess the model. The performance of the model is analysed and compared with the backpropagation (BP) neural network, decision tree, and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) function, which has better overall prediction performance with an RMSE of 22.91 and an MAE of 15.80. Based on meteorological forecasts and expected air quality, a daily emission limit for industrial waste gas can be obtained using model inversion. From 1st to 31th December 2019, if the industrial waste gas daily emission in this area were decreased from 6048.5 million cubic meters of waste gas to 5687.5 million cubic meters, and the daily air quality would be maintained at a good level. This paper deeply explores the dynamic relationship between waste gas daily emissions of industrial enterprises, meteorological factors, and air quality. The meteorological conditions are fully utilized to dynamically adjust the exhaust gas emissions of key polluting enterprises. It not only ensures that the regional air quality is in good condition, but also promotes the in-depth optimization of the procedures of regional industrial enterprises, and reduces the conflict between environmental protection and economic development.

It is important to consider the spatial characteristics of the data, as they allow us to infer predictions in those areas for which no information is available. In the current literature, there are a large number of proposals for spatio-temporal air pollution forecasting. In this paper we propose a novel spatio-temporal approach based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for the identification of multiple non-dominated linear regression models and their combination in an ensemble learning model for air pollution forecasting. The ability of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to find a Pareto front of solutions is used to build multiple forecast models geographically distributed in the area of interest. The proposed method has been applied for one-week NO2 prediction in southeastern Spain and has obtained promising results in statistical comparison with other approaches such as the union of datasets or the interpolation of the predictions for each monitoring station. The validity of the proposed spatio-temporal approach is thus demonstrated, opening up a new field in air pollution engineering.

In this article, we predict the air quality of the next 48 hours for each monitoring station and the daily average air quality of the next 7 days for a city, considering air quality data, meteorology data, and weather forecast data. Based on the domain knowledge about air pollution, we propose a deep neural network based approach, entitled DeepAir. Our approach consists of a deep distributed fusion network for station-level short-term prediction and a deep cascaded fusion network for the city-level long-term forecast. With the data transformation preprocessing, the former network adopts a neural distributed architecture to fuse heterogeneous urban data for simultaneously capturing the direct and indirect factors affecting air quality. The latter network takes a neural cascaded architecture to learn the dynamic influences from previously existing data and future predicted data on future air quality. We have deployed a real-time system on the cloud, providing fine-grained air quality forecasts for 300+ Chinese cities every hour. Our system mainly consists of three components: data crawler, task scheduler, and prediction model, which are implemented with a multi-task architecture to improve the system's efficiency and stability.

PM2.5 is a key factor affecting air quality. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of PM2.5 concentration and make people effectively control the generation and propagation of atmospheric pollutants, in this paper, a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) model based on principal component analysis (PCA) and attention mechanism (attention) is constructed, which first uses PCA to reduce the dimension of data, eliminate the correlation effect between indicators, and reduce model complexity, and then uses the extracted principal components to establish a PCA-attention-LSTM model. Simulation experiments were conducted on the air pollutant data, meteorological element data, and working day data of five cities in Ningxia from 2018 to 2020 to predict the PM2.5 concentration. The PCA-attention-LSTM model is compared with the support vector regression model (SVR), AdaBoost model, random forest model (RF), BP neural network model (BPNN), and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM). The results show that the PCA-attention-LSTM model is optimal; the correlation coefficients of the PCA-attention-LSTM model in Wuzhong, Yinchuan, Zhongwei, Shizuishan, and Guyuan are 0.91, 0.93, 0.91, 0.91, and 0.90, respectively, and the SVR model is the worst. The addition of variables such as a week, precipitation, and temperature can better predict PM2.5 concentration. The concentration of PM2.5 was significantly correlated with the geographical location of the municipal area, and the overall air quality of the southern mountainous area was better than that in the northern Yellow River irrigation area. PM2.5 concentration shows a clear seasonal change trend, with the lowest in summer and the highest in winter, which is closely related to the climate environment of Ningxia.

Epidemiological evidence reports positive associations between BC and cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Despite this, BC is currently not regulated by the EU Air Quality Directive, and as a result BC data are not available in urban areas from reference air quality monitoring networks in many countries. To fill this gap, a machine learning approach is proposed to develop a BC proxy using air pollution datasets as an input. The proposed BC proxy is based on two machine learning models, support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF), using observations of particle mass and number concentrations (N), gaseous pollutants and meteorological variables as the input. Experimental data were collected from a reference station in Barcelona (Spain) over a 2-year period (2018Â2019). Two months of additional data were available from a second urban site in Barcelona, for model validation. BC concentrations estimated by SVR showed a high degree of correlation with the measured BC concentrations (R2 = 0.828) with a relatively low error (RMSE = 0.48 ?g/m3). Model performance was dependent on seasonality and time of the day, due to the influence of new particle formation events. When validated at the second station, performance indicators decreased (R2 = 0.633; RMSE = 1.19 ?g/m3) due to the lack of N data and PM2.5 and the smaller size of the dataset (2 months). New particle formation events critically impacted model performance, suggesting that its application would be optimal in environments where traffic is the main source of ultrafine particles. Due to its flexibility, it is concluded that the model can act as a BC proxy, even based on EU-regulatory air quality parameters only, to complement experimental measurements for exposure assessment in urban areas.

Specifically, we investigate the performance of machine learning and deep learning models to predict ambient PM2.5 concentrations based on other ambient pollutants, including SO (Formula presented.), NO (Formula presented.), O (Formula presented.), CO, and PM10. Here, we applied Bayesian optimization to optimally tune hyperparameters of the Gaussian process regression with different kernels and ensemble learning models (i.e., boosted trees and bagged trees) and investigated their prediction performance. Furthermore, to further enhance the forecasting performance of the investigated models, dynamic information has been incorporated by introducing lagged measurements in the construction of the considered models. Results show a significant improvement in the prediction performance when considering dynamic information from past data. Moreover, three methods, namely, random forest (RF), decision tree, and extreme gradient boosting, are applied to assess variables contribution and revealed that lagged PM2.5 data contribute significantly to the prediction performance and enables the construction of parsimonious models. Hourly concentration levels of ambient air pollution from the air quality monitoring network located in Seoul are employed to verify the prediction effectiveness of the studied models. Six measurements of effectiveness are used for assessing the prediction quality.

This study used machine learning to identify and understand the impact of various factors on O3 formation and thereby predict O3 concentrations under different climate change and emission reduction scenarios. We employed six supervised learning models to estimate O3 concentrations by using 14 meteorological and chemical variables. We found that deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models could accurately predict O3 concentrations. The variable importance analyses emphasized the significant positive contribution of solar radiation to O3; meanwhile both nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds negatively contributed to O3 concentrations. Predicted O3 concentrations based on our DNN and LSTM models in different climate change scenarios showed that increase in water vapor content could offset the effects of raised temperature, and controlling anthropogenic gases, especially carbon monoxide, might have the most bearing on controlling O3 in the future.

According to air pollution and the meteorological monitoring data from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017 in Ningxia, we analyzed the impact of ground surface temperature, air temperature, relative humidity and the power of wind on air pollutant concentrations. Meanwhile, we analyze the relationships between air pollutant concentrations and meteorological variables by using the mathematical model of decision tree regressor (DTR), feedforward artificial neural network with back-propagation algorithm (FFANN-BP) and random forest regressor (RFR) according to air-monitoring station data. For all pollutants, the RFR increases R2 of FFANN-BP and DTR by up to 0.53 and 0.42 respectively, reduces root mean square error (RMSE) by up to 68.7 and 41.2, and MAE by up to 25.2 and 17. The empirical results show that the proposed RFR displays the best forecasting performance and could provide local authorities with reliable and precise predictions of air pollutant concentrations. The RFR effectively establishes the relationships between the influential factors and air pollutant concentrations, and well suppresses the overfitting problem and improves the accuracy of prediction.

The Key Performance Indices (KPI) like coefficient of determination, root mean square error, and mean absolute error were calculated to validate the model accuracy. The K-cross-fold validation for testing data of MLR was obtained as around 92%. Secondly, the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series model is applied to forecast the AQI.

It was found that the CatBoost regression model outperformed all other employed regression models in predicting PM2.5 concentration with an R2 score (coefficient of determination) of 0.81, median absolute error (MedAE) of 6.95 Âµg/m3, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.29, root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.42 Âµg/m3 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.07 Âµg/m3. High PM2.5 concentration prediction results in contrast to Indian standards were also presented. In depth seasonal assessments of PM2.5 concentration were presented, to show variance in PM2.5 concentration during dominant seasons. Â© 2022 by the authors.

This, in turn, requires powerful tools for air quality modeling. In this article we develop a two-stage procedure for predicting exceedances of the EU legal limits for PM10 and O (Formula presented.) concentrations using hourly data. Within the first stage we deploy machine learning methods to produce accurate 24-h-ahead forecasts of hourly pollutant concentrations at seven specific locations in the cities of Augsburg and Munich, Germany. The best performance was shown by the Stochastic Gradient Boosting ModelÂan ensemble tree-based method, especially convenient because of its computational efficiency and robustness to overfitting. Its predictive ability was largely superior to that reported by similar studies. In the second stage, the hourly forecasts were used to predict the exceedances of the EU daily limits for PM10 and O (Formula presented.) concentrations. For both pollutants we could achieve the average probability of exceedances detection above 80%, while keeping the probability of false alarms at a reasonably low level. Such satisfactory results show that our approach can be successfully applied to anticipate the shocks, which would allow authorities to manage them in the most effective manner.

For example, a CTM-based operational forecasting system for air quality over the Pacific Northwest, called AIRPACT, uses over 100 processors for several hours to provide 48-h forecasts daily, but struggles to capture unhealthy O3 episodes during the summer and early fall, especially over Kennewick, WA. This research developed machine learning (ML) based O3 forecasts for Kennewick, WA to demonstrate an improved forecast capability. We used the 2017Â2020 simulated meteorology and O3 observation data from Kennewick as training datasets. The meteorology datasets are from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) meteorological model forecasts produced daily by the University of Washington. Our ozone forecasting system consists of two ML models, ML1 and ML2, to improve predictability: ML1 uses the random forest (RF) classifier and multiple linear regression (MLR) models, and ML2 uses a two-phase RF regression model with best-fit weighting factors. To avoid overfitting, we evaluate the ML forecasting system with the 10-time, 10-fold, and walk-forward cross-validation analysis. Compared to AIRPACT, ML1 improved forecast skill for high-O3 events and captured 5 out of 10 unhealthy O3 events, while AIRPACT and ML2 missed all the unhealthy events. ML2 showed better forecast skill for less elevated-O3 events. Based on this result, we set up our ML modeling framework to use ML1 for high-O3 events and ML2 for less elevated O3 events. Since May 2019, the ML modeling framework has been used to produce daily 72-h O3 forecasts and has provided forecasts via the web for clean air agency and public use: http://ozonematters.com/. Compared to the testing period, the operational forecasting period has not had unhealthy O3 events. Nevertheless, the ML modeling framework demonstrated a reliable forecasting capability at a selected location with much less computational resources. The ML system uses a single processor for minutes compared to the CTM-based forecasting system using more than 100 processors for hours.

Objective: We constructed an ensemble machine learning model to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations for regions lack of PM2.5 observations. Methods: The model was constructed based on daily PM2.5, visibility, and other meteorological data collected at two sites in Kuwait. Then, our model was applied to predict the daily level of PM2.5 concentrations for eight airports located in Kuwait and Iraq from 2013 to 2020. Results: As compared to traditional statistic models, the proposed machine learning methods improved the accuracy in using visibility to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations with a cross-validation R2 of 0.68. The predicted level of daily PM2.5 concentrations were consistent with previous measurements. The predicted average yearly PM2.5 concentration for the eight stations is 50.65 Âµg/m3. For all stations, the monthly average PM2.5 concentrations reached their maximum in July and their minimum in November. Significance: These findings make it possible to retrospectively estimate daily PM2.5 exposures using the large-scale databases of historical visibility in regions with few particulate matter monitoring stations. Impact statement: The scarcity of air pollution ground monitoring networks makes it difficult to assess historical fine particulate matter exposures for countries in arid areas such as Kuwait. Visibility is closely related to atmospheric particulate matter concentrations and historical airport visibility records are commonly available in most countries. Our model make it possible to retrospectively estimate daily PM2.5 exposures using the large-scale databases of historical visibility in arid regions with few particulate matter ground monitoring stations.

This paper proposes a new cross-domain prediction model of air pollutant concentration based on federated learning (FL), differential privacy laplace mechanism (DPLA) and long and short-term memory network optimized by sparrow search algorithm (SSA-LSTM), named FL-DPLA-SSA-LSTM. Firstly, with FL, SSA-LSTM is used as local training model for each city and predicts air pollutant concentration. Secondly, DPLA is used to add noise to the local model parameters, which can protect local data security. Then, the global model is updated by using the federated averaging algorithm (FedAvg). Lastly, FL is used to share global model for all cities, which can safely and quickly cross-domain predict air pollutant concentration. For data set, it is taken from hourly air pollutants and meteorological data from 12 cities in the Fenhe River and Weihe River Plains in China in 2020. The experimental results show that the prediction performance of the proposed model is significantly better than all comparison models. FedAvg updating with local model parameters with DPLA noise has little effect on the performance of the global model and even exceeds that of the global model. The calculation time of FL-DPLA-SSA-LSTM model is reduced by 99.95% compared with that of not using FL-DPLA machine learning model. It is proved that the model is high sharing and high safety, which greatly improves the training efficiency and has better generalization ability. It is significant for joint air pollution prevention and control and environmental protection.

The applied method is to strict measures and to better manage particulate matter pollution in Ras Garib city, Egypt as a case study. Air pollution data for the period between 2018 and 2021 is collected using five air quality stations. Some of these stations are located near highly urbanized locations and could be dense with the current rates of development in the future. The random forest was applied to verify and visualize the relationships between the particulate matter and different independent variables. Spectral bands of Landsat OLI 8 imaginary and land cover/land use indices were used to prepare independent variables. Analysis of the results reveals that the proper air quality distribution monitoring stations would provide a deep insight into the pollution distribution over the study site.

In this scenario, the authors proposed various machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest, KNN, ridge and lasso, XGBoost, and AdaBoost models to predict PM2.5 pollutants in polluted cities. This experiment is carried out using Jupyter Notebook in Python 3.7.3. From the results with respect to MAE, MAPE, and RMSE metrics, among the models, XGBoost, AdaBoost, random forest, and KNN models (8.27, 0.40, and 13.85; 9.23, 0.45, and 10.59; 39.84, 1.94, and 54.59; and 49.13, 2.40, and 69.92, respectively) are observed to be more reliable models.

In India, the majority metropolitan spot has a deprived air quality with PM 2.5 levels exceeding the suggested limits. Apparently 60 % of Indian metropolitan areas has PM 2.5 levels greater than the index suggested by National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Hence, it is important to examine the level of PM 2.5 in air. In this paper, PM 2.5 level is monitored at various time stamp through Deep Learning (DL) technique called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) which is a modification of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The proposed model will assist in alerting the dangerous level of PM 2.5 and taking action against it.

To address this issue, we developed and compared different modeling approaches to impute missing daily average particulate matter (PM10) data between 2010 and 2017 using spatiotemporal predictor variables. The random forest (RF) machine learning method was used to explore the relationship between average daily PM10 concentrations and spatiotemporal predictors like meteorological, land use and source-related variables.

Studies have typically relied on relatively sparse environmental monitoring data that lack the spatial resolution to assess small-area improvements in air quality and health. Few studies have integrated multiple types of measures of an air pollutant into one single modeling framework that combines spatially- and temporally-rich monitoring data. In this paper, we investigated the differential effects of California emissions reduction plan on reducing air pollution between those living in the goods movement corridors (GMC) that are within 500 m of major highways that serve as truck routes to those farther away or adjacent to routes that prohibit trucks. A mixed effects Deletion/Substitution/Addition (D/S/A) machine learning algorithm was developed to model annual pollutant concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by taking repeated measures into consideration and by integrating multiple types of NO2 measurements, including those through government regulatory and research-oriented saturation monitoring into a single modeling framework. Difference-in-difference analysis was conducted to identify whether those living in GMC demonstrated statistically larger reductions in air pollution exposure. The mixed effects D/S/A machine learning modeling result indicated that GMC had 2 ppb greater reductions in NO2 concentrations from pre- to post-policy period than far away areas. The difference-in-difference analysis demonstrated that the subjects living in GMC experienced statistically significant greater reductions in NO2 exposure than those living in the far away areas. This study contributes to scientific knowledge by providing empirical evidence that improvements in air quality via the emissions reductions plan policies impacted traffic-related air pollutant concentrations and associated exposures most among low-income Californians with chronic conditions living in GMC. The identified differences in pollutant reductions across different location domains may be applicable to other states or other countries if similar policies are enacted.

PM2.5 is one of the main components of air pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to know the PM2.5 air quality in advance for health. Many studies on air quality are based on the governmentÂs official air quality monitoring stations, which cannot be widely deployed due to high cost constraints. Furthermore, the update frequency of government monitoring stations is once an hour, and it is hard to capture short-term PM2.5 concentration peaks with little warning. Nevertheless, dealing with short-term data with many stations, the volume of data is huge and is calculated, analyzed and predicted in a complex way. This alleviates the high computational requirements of the original predictor, thus making Spark suitable for the considered problem. This study proposes a PM2.5 instant prediction architecture based on the Spark big data framework to handle the huge data from the LASS community. The Spark big data framework proposed in this study is divided into three modules. It collects real time PM2.5 data and performs ensemble learning through three machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) to predict the PM2.5 concentration value in the next 30 to 180 min with accompanying visualization graph. The experimental results show that our proposed Spark big data ensemble prediction model in next 30-min prediction has the best performance (R2 up to 0.96), and the ensemble model has better performance than any single machine learning model. Taiwan has been suffering from a situation of relatively poor air pollution quality for a long time. Air pollutant monitoring data from LASS community can provide a wide broader monitoring, however the data is large and difficult to integrate or analyze.

Some air pollutants exhibit similar behavior in the atmosphere, and some interact with each other; thus, comprehensive assessments of individual air pollutants are required. In this study, we developed national-scale monthly models for six air pollutants (NO, NO2, SO2, O3, PM2.5, and suspended particulate matter (SPM)) to obtain accurate estimates of pollutant concentrations at 1 km Ã 1 km resolution from 2010 through 2015 for application to the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS), which is a large-scale birth cohort study. We developed our models in the land use regression framework using random forests in conjunction with kriging. We evaluated the model performance via 5-fold location-based cross-validation. We successfully predicted monthly NO (r2 = 0.65), NO2 (r2 = 0.84), O3 (r2 = 0.86), PM2.5 (r2 = 0.79), and SPM (r2 = 0.64) concentrations. For SO2, a satisfactory model could not be developed (r2 = 0.45) because of the low SO2 concentrations in Japan. The performance of our models is comparable to those reported in previous studies at similar temporal and spatial scales. The model predictions in conjunction with the JECS will reveal the critical windows of prenatal and infancy exposure to ambient air pollutants, thus contributing to the development of environmental policies on air pollution.

Existing spatiotemporal interpolation algorithms are usually based on the assumption that interpolation models follow explicit and simple mathematical descriptions. Unfortunately, the real world does not really follow these perfect mathematical models. Combining data fusion techniques and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), we present a novel spatiotemporal interpolation model, which is able to achieve high estimation accuracies over a long time period and a large area. By fusing the daily PM2.5 data, meteorological data, elevation data, and land-use data collected from China in 2016, four experiments were conducted in this study to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results showed that applying LSTM RNN on the fused dataset can achieve consistent and high accuracy in different geographies.

To this end, this paper proposes the long-short term memory network (LSTM) algorithm based on spatiotemporal fusion. First, the spatial correlation, the relevant factors and the calculation methods are proposed; then, the local spatial correlation factors are combined with the forget gate and the remember gate of the LSTM algorithm to construct a LSTM algorithm based on local spatial information and spatial-temporal correlation, namely the LTS-LSTM; after that, the learning result of LTS-LSTM is combined with the global spatial correlation factors to construct a LSTM algorithm based on global spatial information and spatial-temporal correlation, namely the GTS-LSTM; at last, the proposed algorithm is adopted to simulate the global and local air pollution particle concentration evolution process, and predict the particle concentration. On the global and local observation dataset, the proposed algorithm is compared with the regression algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), fuzzy neural network (FNN), LSTM neural network, GC-LSTM neural network, and DL-LSTM neural network.

We built linear regression and random forest regression models using 4-years (2015Â2018; hourly-averaged) observations for forecasting O3, NO and NO2 levels for two scenarios (1-month prediction (for January 2019) and 1-year prediction (for 2019)) Â with and without the impact of meteorology. These flexible models have been developed for, both, localised (site-specific models) and combined (indicative of city-level) cases. Both models were aided with machine learning, to reduce their time-intensity compared to models built over high-performance computing. O3 prediction performance of linear regression model at the city level, under both cases of meteorological consideration, was found to be significantly poor. However, the site-specific model with meteorology performed satisfactorily (r = 0.87; RK Puram site). Further, during testing, linear regression models (site-specific and combined) for NO and NO2 with meteorology, show a slight improvement in their prediction accuracies when compared to the corresponding equivalent linear models without meteorology. Random forest regression with meteorology performed satisfactorily for indicative city-level NO (r = 0.90), NO2 (r = 0.89) and O3 (r = 0.85). In both regression techniques, increased uncertainty in modelling O3 is attributed to it being a secondary pollutant, non-linear dependency on NOx, VOCs, CO, radicals, and micro-climatic meteorological parameters. Analysis of importance among various precursors and meteorology have also been computed. The study holistically concludes that site-specific models with meteorology perform satisfactorily for both linear regression and random forest regression.

Some of them may turn into more harmful forms by accumulating in different layers of the atmosphere at different times and can be transported to other regions with atmospheric events. Particulate matter (PM) is one of the most important air pollutants in the atmosphere, and it can be released into the atmosphere by natural and anthropogenic processes or can be formed in the atmosphere as a result of chemical reactions. In this study, it was aimed to predict PM10 and PM2.5 components measured in an industrial zone selected by adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), classification and regression trees (CART), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) methods. To this end, in the first stage of the study, the dataset consisting of air pollutants and meteorological data was created, the temporal and qualitative evaluation of these data was performed, and the PM (PM10 and PM2.5) components were modeled using the ÂRÂ software environment by artificial intelligence methods. The ANFIS model was more successful in predicting the PM10 (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 5.87, MAE = 4.75) and PM2.5 (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 3.05, MAE = 2.18) values in comparison with other methods. As a result of the study, it was clearly observed that the ANFIS model could be used in the prediction of air pollutants.

Therefore, the European Commission formulated directives to regulate O3 concentrations in near-surface air. However, almost 50% of the 5068 air quality stations in Europe do not monitor O3 concentrations. This study aims to provide a hybrid modeling system that fills these gaps in the hourly surface O3 observations on a site scale with much higher accuracy than existing O3 models. This hybrid model was developed using estimations from multiple linear regression-based eXtreme Gradient Boosting Machines (MLR-XGBM) and O3 reanalysis from European regional air quality models (CAMS-EU). The binary classification of extremely high O3 events and the 1- and 24-h forecasts of hourly O3 were investigated as secondary aims. In this study thirteen stations in Northern Bavaria, out of which six do not monitor O3, were chosen as test sites. Considering the computational complexity of machine learning algorithms (MLAs), we also applied two recent MLA interpretation methods, namely SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). With SHAP, we showed an increasing effect of temperature on O3 concentrations which intensifies for temperatures exceeding 17 Â°C. According to LIME, O3 concentration peaks are mainly governed by meteorological factors under dry and warm conditions on a regional scale, whereas local nitrogen oxide concentrations control base O3 concentrations during cold and wet periods. While recently developed MLAs for the spatial estimation of hourly O3 concentrations had a station-based root-mean-square error (RMSE) above 27 ?g/m3, our proposed model significantly reduced the estimation errors by about 66% with an RMSE of 9.49 ?g/m3. We also found that logistic regression (LR) and MLR-XGBM performed best in the site-scale classification and 24-h forecast of O3 concentrations (with a station-averaged accuracy and RMSE of 0.95 and 19.34 ?g/m3, respectively).

BART is constructed under a probabilistic framework that also allows for model-based prediction uncertainty quantification. We evaluated the application of BART in predicting daily concentrations of four fine particulate matter (PM2.5) components (elemental carbon, organic carbon, nitrate, and sulfate) in California during the period 2005 to 2014. We demonstrate in this paper how BART can be tuned to optimize prediction performance and how to evaluate variable importance. Our BART models included, as predictors, a large suite of land-use variables, meteorological conditions, satellite-derived aerosol optical depth parameters, and simulations from a chemical transport model. In cross-validation experiments, BART demonstrated good out-of-sample prediction performance at monitoring locations (R2 from 0.62 to 0.73). More importantly, prediction intervals associated with concentration estimates from BART showed good coverage probability at locations with and without monitoring data. In our case study, major PM2.5 components could be estimated with good accuracy, especially when collocated PM2.5 total mass observations were available. In conclusion, BART is an attractive approach for modeling ambient air pollution levels, especially for its ability to provide uncertainty in estimates that may be useful for subsequent health impact and health effect analyses.

In stage 1, a Random Forest (RF) model was used to impute Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction AOD data for days where it was missing. In stage 2, the machine learner algorithms RF, Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression were used to model the relationship between ground-monitored PM10 data, AOD and other spatial and temporal predictors. These were subsequently combined in an ensemble model to predict daily PM10 concentrations at 1 km Ã 1 km spatial resolution across the four provinces. An out-of-bag R2 of 0.96 was achieved for the first stage model. The stage 2 cross-validated (CV) ensemble model captured 0.84 variability in ground-monitored PM10 with a spatial CV R2 of 0.48 and temporal CV R2 of 0.80. The stage 2 model indicated an optimal performance of the daily predictions when aggregated to monthly and annual means.

One of the key issues for existing AQP approaches is that air quality monitoring stations are sparsely distributed, typically with around ten monitoring stations per city. As air quality may change abruptly in a local area, it is difficult to perform AQP accurately in areas that are far away from observation points. In addition, due to the large distance between every two monitoring stations, we cannot effectively leverage spatial relations among them to improve the AQP accuracy. In this paper, thanks to the development of low-cost air quality sensors, we are now able to collect a large-scale air quality dataset with 393 deployed air quality monitoring stations in a 120 km Ã 70 km region, which is more than ten times denser than existing AQP datasets. Further, we present a novel method to handle the data effectively. Specifically, we first convert the observed data from irregularly distributed monitoring stations into a regular image-like pollution map, which can then be processed with advanced deep convolutional networks. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously model the temporal and spatial relations in our large-scale densely-observed dataset, leading to significantly improved AQP results.

This study aims to explore the performances of an advanced machine learning (ML) method, the boosted regression trees (BRT) technique, in exploring the relationships between surface O3 and its driving factors, and in predicting the levels of O3 concentrations. To this end, a BRT model was trained on hourly data of air pollutants and meteorological parameters, acquired, over the 2016Â2018 period, in a rural area affected by an anthropic source of air pollutants. The abilities of the BRT model in ranking, visualizing, and predicting the relationship between ground-level O3 concentrations and its driving factors were analyzed and illustrated. A comparison with a multiple linear regression (MLR) model was performed based on several statistical indicators. The results obtained indicated that the BRT model was able to account for 81% of changes in O3 concentrations; it slightly outperforms the MLR model in terms of the predictions accuracy and allows a better identification of the main factors influencing O3 variability on a local scale. This knowledge is expected to be useful in defining effective measures to prevent and/or mitigate the health damages associated with O3 exposure. Â© 2020 by the authors.

In this study, we created a machine learning-based scheme to estimate PM2.5 using various open data such as satellite remote sensing, meteorological data, and land variables to increase the limited spatial coverage provided by ground-monitors. A space-time extremely randomised trees model was used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations over Europe, this model achieved good results with an out-of-sample cross-validated R-2 of 0.69, RMSE of 5 mu g/m(3), and MAE of 3.3 mu g/m(3). The outcome of this study is a daily full coverage PM2.5 dataset with 1 km spatial resolution for the three-year period of 2018-2020. We found that air quality improved throughout the study period over all countries in Europe. In addition, we compared PM2.5 levels during the COVID-19 lockdown during the months March-June with the average of the previous 4 months and the following 4 months. We found that this lockdown had a positive effect on air quality in most parts of the study area except for the United Kingdom, Ireland, north of France, and south of Italy. This is the first study that depends only on open data and covers the whole of Europe with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The reconstructed dataset will be published under free and open license and can be used in future air quality studies.",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs14143392,6,3,Yes,ERT,,Yes,Czech Republic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Powered by the data obtained from air pollution monitoring stations, we now have a chance to build sophisticated models to estimate the future concentration of various air pollutants. Previous researches show that deep learning models perform a better task of capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics from the data as compared to traditional statistical models. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning framework -AGCTCN (Attention based Graph Convolution and Temporal Convolution Network), based on spatial attention, graph convolution and temporal convolution is presented for short-term forecasting of particulate matter (PM) levels. Specifically, quarter-hourly PM(10 )and PM2.5 data aggregated from 27 ground air pollution monitoring stations in Delhi, India is used for training the AGCTCN model and our model forecasts the concentrations of these pollutants at these stations for a particular horizon in the future. The forecasts generated by our model are compared and contrasted to those generated by other state-of-the-art models like GC-LSTM and ConvLSTM with respect to four widely used evaluation metrics namely RMSE (root mean squared error), MAE (mean absolute error), correlation coefficient, and R-2 (coefficient of determination). Our model shows more than 80% improvement over the GC-LSTM model in terms of the R-2 metric, performs the best task of estimating the peak PM concentrations and shows variability and correlation close to that of the observed data. A carefully conducted ablation study shows the effectiveness of the individual components of our architecture. The graph convolution layer improves the model accuracy by approximately 34% on average on the PM datasets.

To efficiently represent the time-varying spatial dependencies, a new spatiotemporal dynamic correla-tion calculation method based on gray relation analysis is proposed to construct dynamic adjacency matrices. Then, the spatiotemporal features are sufficiently extracted by the graph convolutional network and the multi-channel temporal convolutional network.

Here, we performed 20-s resolution observations of O3 precursors and meteorological factors to train a random forest model capable of accurately predicting O3 concentrations. Our model performed well with an average validated R2 of 0.997. Unlike in typical linear model frameworks, variable dependencies are not clearly modelled by random forest model. Thus, we conducted additional studies to provide insight into the photochemical and atmospheric dynamic processes driving variations in O3 concentrations. At nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentrations of 10Â20 ppb, all the other O3 precursors were in states that increased the production of O3. Over a short timescale, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can almost track each high-frequency variation in O3. Meteorological factors play a more important role than O3 precursors do in predicting O3 concentrations at a high temporal resolution; however, individual meteorological factors are not sufficient to track every high-frequency change in O3. Nevertheless, the sharp variations in O3 related to flow dynamics are often accompanied by steep temperature changes. Our results suggest that high-temporal-resolution observations, both ground-based and vertical profiles, are necessary for the accurate assessment of human exposure to O3 and the success and accountability of the emission control strategies for improving air quality.

This study aims to identify a suitable deep learning architecture for deriving spatiotemporal distributions of surface NO2 across China. Based on satellite retrievals and geographic variables, we compared the performance of a series of deep learning models and a benchmark model (i.e., random forest) in predicting daily NO2 during 2016Â2017 on a 0.1Â° grid. The deep learning models tested were hybrids of full connection layers (FC), autoencoders (AE), residual networks (RES), and convolution layers (CNN). Their ensemble forms were also comparatively evaluated. The integrated results of the sample-, cell-, and date-based holdout tests show that the ensemble FC-AE-RES-CNN model (R2 = 0.71; RMSE = 9.9 ?g/m3) outperformed the random forest (R2 = 0.67; RMSE = 10.8 ?g/m3), but none of the single-form networks did (R2 ranged from 0.56 to 0.61, and RMSE ranged from 11.6 to 12.2 ?g/m3). The superior performance of the ensemble FC-AE-RES-CNN model could be attributed to its lower bias and lower variance, which benefited from the sophisticated model structure and the ensemble strategy. Consequently, the ensemble FC-AE-RES-CNN model predictions demonstrated a spatiotemporal distribution of surface NO2 with higher fidelity.

We also evaluated different spatial interpolation methods to produce surface distribution of AQI, and noted that the Ordinary Kriging outperformed other methods. The spatial distribution of AQI in YRD showed seasonal and annual variations. However, the days with AQI over 100 (level ii) were mostly observed in winter. Generally, more severe air pollution was observed in the northern part of YRD than in the southern ones, for example the air quality of the Ningbo metropolitan area was the best, while in Hefei it was the worst. It was found that meteorological parameters have spatially varying effects on AQI. For instance, pressure has a significant positive effect on AQI, and others showed negative correlations.

The typical assumption is that time series has a long signal with no white noise. However, a real-time short signal with white noise is common.

Estimating air qualities in Beijing during the Blue Sky Day period (2008-2012) by Bayesian Multi-task LSTM,Blue sky day; Air quality; Beijing; Bayesian LSTM; Multi-task learning; Data re-estimation,"For over three decades, air pollution has been a major environmental challenge in many of the fast-growing cities of the world, including Beijing, China. Given that any long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution has devastating health consequences, accurately monitoring and reporting air pollution information to the public is critical for ensuring public health and safety, while facilitating rigorous air pollution and health-related scientific research. Recent statistical research examining China's air quality data has posed questions on data accuracy, especially data reported during the Blue Sky Day (BSD) period (2000-2012), even though the quality of publicly available air quality data in China has improved substantially over the recent years (2013-2017). Until now, no attempts have been made to re-estimate the air quality data during the BSD period. In this study, we propose a multi-task machine-learning model to re-estimate the official air quality data during the recent BSD period, from 2008 to 2012, utilizing PM2.5 data reported by the US Embassy in Beijing and proxy data covering Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and meteorology. Results have shown that average re-estimated daily air qualities are respectively 56% and 55% higher than the official ones, for air quality index (AQI) and AQI equivalent PM2.5, during the BSD period, from 2008 to 2012. Moreover, the re-estimated BSD air quality data exhibit reduced statistical discontinuity and irregularity. Our novel data re-estimation methodology can be used to provide more credible historical air quality data for evidence-based environmental and public health studies.",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,10.1016/j.envsci.2020.10.015,9,3,Yes,LSTM,,No,"Peoples R China,England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a novel hybrid ensemble model with three deep learning predictors is proposed for hourly PM2.5 concentration forecasting. In the proposed model, the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) is used to extract the features in the PM2.5 data series to reduce its complexity. Three deep neural networks are used as predictors for data forecasting, including deep belief network (DBN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). Each predictor is given a weight, and the imperial competition algorithm (ICA) is used to optimize weights to obtain the best forecasting result.

However, existing air quality forecasting models mainly focus on site-specific time series forecasts at a local level, and rarely consider the spatiotemporal relationships among regional monitoring stations. As a novelty, we construct a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network (DCRNN) model that fully considers the influence of geographic distance and dominant wind direction on the regional variations in air quality through different combinations of directed and undirected graphs. The hourly fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) and ozone data from 123 air quality monitoring stations in the Yangtze River Delta, China are used to evaluate the performance of the DCRNN model in the regional prediction of PM2.5 and ozone concentrations. Results show that the proposed DCRNN model outperforms the baseline models in prediction accuracy. Compared with the undirected graph model, the directed graph model considering the effects of wind direction performs better in 24 h predictions of pollutant concentrations. In addition, more accurate forecasts of both PM2.5 and ozone are found at a regional level where monitoring stations are distributed densely rather than sparsely. Therefore, the proposed model can assist environmental researchers to further improve the technologies of air quality forecasts and could also serve as tools for environmental policymakers to implement pollution control measures.

Achieving accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration has become an important research task. However, PM2.5 pollutants can spread in the earthÂs atmosphere, causing mutual influence between different cities. To effectively capture the air pollution relationship between cities, this paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal model combining graph attention neural network (GAT) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), named GAT-GRU for PM2.5 concentration prediction. Specifically, GAT is used to learn the spatial dependence of PM2.5 concentration data in different cities, and GRU is to extract the temporal dependence of the long-term data series. The proposed model integrates the learned spatio-temporal dependencies to capture long-term complex spatio-temporal features. Considering that air pollution is related to the meteorological conditions of the city, the knowledge acquired from meteorological data is used in the model to enhance PM2.5 prediction performance. The input of the GAT-GRU model consists of PM2.5 concentration data and meteorological data. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed GAT-GRU prediction model, this paper designs experiments on real-world datasets compared with other baselines.

However, existing prediction methods mostly emphasize the fitting analysis of time series, but ignore the spatial propagation effect among nearby places, resulting in a low prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel synthesis prediction method to simultaneously excavate the time series changing law and the spatial propagation effect. This method combines a characterization model named air quality spatial-temporal network (AQSTN) and a neural network model called graph convolution neural network (GCN). Firstly, by calculating three correlation coefficients, the time series of most related meteorological factors and aerosol data are gained for feature construction. The geographic distances between locations are computed to evaluate the spatial propagation cost. After that, AQSTN with locations as nodes and propagation relations as edges is constructed, compositing the temporal and spatial relationships. The network is regarded as graph data and input into GCN in chronological order. Secondly, GCN processing graph-structured data fits the optimal parameters in the training stage, simultaneously analyzes the spatial and temporal dimensions of the target site and its adjacent sites. And, the predicted PM 2.5 concentration is gained in the test stage. The near-surface monitoring data of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area are adopted for experiment. Compared with the second-best model, the RMSE value of AQSTN-GCN is 6.85% lower, MAE value is 13.79% lower, MSE value is 13.23% lower, and MAPE value is 21.53% lower.

Detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of PM2.5 is meaningful for the prevention and control of air pollution. Satellite remote sensing has become an effective way to observe PM2.5 concentrations. However, most studies have focused on mapping PM2.5 concentrations from satellite-derived daytime aerosol optical depth (AOD), which cannot effectively depict the nighttime atmospheric environment. This paper aims to develop a method to derive nighttime PM2.5 concentrations in Nanjing, China, using the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP)/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime light remote sensing data during September–December 2020. The relationship between the satellite at-sensor radiance, PM2.5 concentrations and other environmental factors was first explored based on the nighttime radiative transfer equation. Taking into account the pixel direct radiation and the background scattered radiation, the spatial independent variables for estimating nighttime PM2.5 were determined. Five machine learning algorithms and multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed to develop models to estimate nighttime PM2.5 concentrations. The results showed that the MLR model had obviously lower accuracy than the machine learning models, and the RF model outperformed the other models, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.81 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.85 μg·m−3. Then, the developed model was applied to map the nighttime PM2.5 concentrations over Nanjing, which well characterized the nighttime atmospheric environment at a fine resolution.

This study uses deep learning (DL) to accurately estimate daily maximum 8-hr average (MDA8) ozone and examines the spatial contribution of several factors on ozone levels over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) in 2019. A comparison between in-situ observations and DL-estimated MDA8 ozone values shows a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95, an index of agreement (IOA) of 0.97, and a mean absolute bias (MAB) of 2.79 ppb, highlighting the promising performance of the deep convolutional neural network (Deep-CNN) at estimating surface MDA8 ozone. Spatial cross-validation also confirms the high spatial accuracy of the model, which obtains an R of 0.91, and IOA of 0.96 and an MAB of 3.46 ppb when it is trained and tested on separate stations. To interpret the black-box nature of our DL model, we use Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to generate a spatial feature contribution map (SFCM), the results of which confirm an advanced ability of Deep-CNN to capture the interactions between most predictor variables and ozone. For instance, the model shows that solar radiation (SRad) SFCM, with higher values, enhances the formation of ozone, particularly in the south and southwestern CONUS. As SRad triggers ozone precursors to produce ozone via photochemical reactions, it increases ozone concentrations. The model also shows that humidity, with its low values, increases ozone concentrations in the western mountainous regions. The negative correlation between humidity and ozone levels can be attributed to factors such as higher ozone decomposition resulting from increased levels of humidity and OH radicals. This study is the first to introduce the SFCM to investigate the spatial role of predictor variables on changes in estimated MDA8 ozone levels. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121508,3,3,Yes,DCNN,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Random forest regression was used to predict historical and future trends of ozone levels, and k-nearest neighbor was used as a binary classifier for ozone exceedance prediction. The models were trained on meteorology data from Ontario and Los Angeles International Airport stations and air quality data from the Fontana, California air monitoring station, and data were collected for the 1994 to 2018 time period. Upon model evaluation, the correlation of the RFR model was 0.92, and the probability of detection for ozone exceedances using k-nearest neighbors was 0.81 for the most recent years of the analysis (2014-2018). We also ran a 4 km Community Multiscale Air Quality model simulation to generate air pollution estimates over Southern California. As expected, ozone in Fontana was positively correlated with temperature. The ozone exceedance hours usually occurred when the temperature was above 25 °C, and the wind direction was from 270° (westerly). Ozone sensitivity as a function of temperature and NOx was also examined. Observed troughs in hourly NOx concentrations during midday under high temperatures suggests that most of the ambient NOx reacted, also as expected.

Having such system can also help the government to take better mitigation and preventive measures. Forecasting systems based on machine learning are gaining importance due to their cost-effectiveness and applicability to small towns and villages, where most complex models are not feasible due to resource constraints and limited data availability.

Here, we developed a novel machine learning ensemble model coupled with a Shapley additive explanation algorithm to predict the O3 formation regime and derive O3 formation sensitivity curves. The algorithm was tested for O3 events during the COVID-19 lockdown, a sandstorm event, and a heavy O3 pollution episode (maximum hourly O3 concentration >200 μg/m3) from 2019 to 2021. We show that increasing O3 concentrations during the COVID-19 lockdown and the heavy O3 pollution event were mainly caused by the photochemistry subject to local air quality and meteorological conditions. Influenced by the sandstorm weather, low O3 levels were mainly attributable to weak sunlight and low precursor levels. O3 formation sensitivity curves demonstrate that O3 formation in the study area was in a VOCs-sensitive regime. The VOCs-specific O3 sensitivity curves can also help make hybrid and timely strategies for O3 abatement.

The observational data from 13 monitoring stations in Kaohsiung in 2021 were selected for model training and testing. First, CNN was implemented to extract key meteorological and pollution data. Subsequently, the RF algorithm was employed to train the model with five input factors, namely the extracted features from the CNN and spatiotemporal factors, including the day of the year, the hour of the day, latitude, and longitude. Independent observations from two stations were used to evaluate the models. The findings demonstrated that the proposed CNN–RF model had better modeling capability compared with the independent CNN and RF models: the average improvements in root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) ranged from 8.10% to 11.11%, respectively. In addition, the proposed CNN–RF hybrid model has fewer excess residuals at thresholds of 10 μg/m3, 20 μg/m3, and 30 μg/m3. The results revealed that the proposed CNN–RF ensemble framework is a stable, reliable, and accurate method that can generate superior results compared with the single CNN and RF methods.

The data used were collected between 2015 and 2020 at the Microclimate and Air Pollutants Monitoring Tower station at Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand. The results showed that the correlation coefficients of PM2.5 predicted and observed using MLR and MLP were in the range of 0.69–0.86 and 0.64–0.82, respectively, for 1–3 days ahead. Both models showed satisfactory agreement with the measured data, and MLR performed better than MLP at PM2.5 prediction. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the proposed approach can be used as a component of an early warning system in cities, contributing to sustainable air quality management in urban areas. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14030589,3,3,Yes,"LR,MLP",,,"Thailand,Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study area is Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, and the study period is from January 2015 to July 2022. During this period, Xi'an exceeded China's National Ambient Air Quality Grade Ⅰ standard for PM for up to 70% of the days. The prediction results of the TCN-LSTM model were compared with those of deep learning models (Convolutional Neural Network-LSTM, TCN, and LSTM) and machine learning models (Support Vector Regression and Random Forest). The R2 values of the TCN-LSTM model were all >0.88, indicating better performance than that of the other five models, and the errors of the TCN-LSTM model were all lower than those of the other five models. The results showed that high-accuracy PM predictions using deep learning models can improve air quality monitoring by compensating for problems in the environmental monitoring process such as pollutant monitoring errors caused by instrument failures. Additionally, sensitivity analysis helps to identify the key factors influencing the behavior of PM. A sensitivity analysis of PM for different periods of COVID-19 found that PM2.5 is more sensitive to O3, while PM10 is mainly influenced by PM2.5. The sensitivity analysis for the whole period showed that PM was closely related to CO. Removing variables that do not contribute to the model output based on the sensitivity analysis results improves modeling efficiency while reducing operating costs and improving environmental monitoring activities and management strategies. © 2023 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",Atmospheric Pollution Research,10.1016/j.apr.2023.101703,3,3,Yes,"TCNN,LSTM",,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we want to provide a reasonable basis for haze prevention, then the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations becomes a crucial task. However, it is difficult to complete the task of PM2.5 concentration prediction using a single model; therefore, to address this problem, this paper proposes a fully adaptive noise ensemble empirical modal decomposition (CEEMDAN) algorithm combined with deep learning hybrid models. Firstly, the CEEMDAN algorithm was used to decompose the PM2.5 timeseries data into different modal components. Then long short-term memory (LSTM), a backpropagation (BP) neural network, a differential integrated moving average autoregressive model (ARIMA), and a support vector machine (SVM) were applied to each modal component. Lastly, the best prediction results of each component were superimposed and summed to obtain the final prediction results. The PM2.5 data of Hangzhou in recent years were substituted into the model for testing, which was compared with eight models, namely, LSTM, ARIMA, BP, SVM, CEEMDAN–ARIMA, CEEMDAN–LSTM, CEEMDAN–SVM, and CEEMDAN–BP. The results show that for the coupled CEEMDAN–LSTM–BP–ARIMA model, the prediction ability was better than all the other models, and the timeseries decomposition data of PM2.5 had their own characteristics.

The environment has been significantly impacted by rapid urbanization, leading to a need for changes in climate change and pollution indicators. The 4IR offers a potential solution to efficiently manage these impacts. Smart city ecosystems can provide well-designed, sustainable, and safe cities that enable holistic climate change and global warming solutions through various community-centred initiatives. These include smart planning techniques, smart environment monitoring, and smart governance. An air quality intelligence platform, which operates as a complete measurement site for monitoring and governing air quality, has shown promising results in providing actionable insights. This article aims to highlight the potential of machine learning models in predicting air quality, providing data-driven strategic and sustainable solutions for smart cities. Methods. This study proposed an end-to-end air quality predictive model for smart city applications, utilizing four machine learning techniques and two deep learning techniques. These include Ada Boost, SVR, RF, KNN, MLP regressor and LSTM. The study was conducted in four different urban cities in Selangor, Malaysia, including Petaling Jaya, Banting, Klang, and Shah Alam. The model considered the air quality data of various pollution markers such as PM2.5, PM10, O3, and CO. Additionally, meteorological data including wind speed and wind direction were also considered, and their interactions with the pollutant markers were quantified. The study aimed to determine the correlation variance of the dependent variable in predicting air pollution and proposed a feature optimization process to reduce dimensionality and remove irrelevant features to enhance the prediction of PM2.5, improving the existing LSTM model. The study estimates the concentration of pollutants in the air based on training and highlights the contribution of feature optimization in air quality predictions through feature dimension reductions. Results. In this section, the results of predicting the concentration of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, and CO) in the air are presented in R2 and RMSE. In predicting the PM10 and PM2.5 concentration, LSTM performed the best overall high R2 values in the four study areas with the R2 values of 0.998, 0.995, 0.918, and 0.993 in Banting, Petaling, Klang and Shah Alam stations, respectively. The study indicated that among the studied pollution markers, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, wind speed and humidity are the most important elements to monitor. By reducing the number of features used in the model the proposed feature optimization process can make the model more interpretable and provide insights into the most critical factor affecting air quality. Findings from this study can aid policymakers in understanding the underlying causes of air pollution and develop more effective smart strategies for reducing pollution levels. © Copyright 2023 Neo et al.",PeerJ Computer Science,10.7717/peerj-cs.1306,3,3,Yes,"AB,SVR,RF,KNN,MLP,LSTM",,,"Malaysia,Indonesia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severe air pollution can cause respiratory diseases, while good air quality is beneficial to physical and mental health. Therefore, the prediction of air quality is very important. Since the concentration data of air pollutants are time series, their time characteristics should be considered in their prediction. However, the traditional neural network for time series prediction is limited by its own structure, which makes it very easy for it to fall into a local optimum during the training process. The empirical mode decomposition fuzzy forecast model for air quality, which is based on the extreme learning machine, is proposed in this paper. Empirical mode decomposition can analyze the changing trend of air quality well and obtain the changing trend of air quality under different time scales. According to the changing trend under different time scales, the extreme learning machine is used for fast training, and the corresponding prediction value is obtained. The adaptive fuzzy inference system is used for fitting to obtain the final air quality prediction result. The experimental results show that our model improves the accuracy of both short-term and long-term prediction by about 30% compared to other models, which indicates the remarkable efficacy of our approach. The research of this paper can provide the government with accurate future air quality information, which can take corresponding control measures in a targeted manner. © 2022 by the authors.",Entropy,10.3390/e24121803,5,3,Yes,ELM,,,China,forecast,AQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,Empirical mode decomposition (EMD),,,,,

One of the biggest challenges posed by the rapid migration of inhabitants into cities is increased air pollution. Sustainable Development Goal 11 indicates that 99 percent of the world’s urban population breathes polluted air. In such a trend of urbanization, predicting the concentrations of pollutants in advance is very important. Predictions of pollutants would help city administrations to take timely measures for ensuring Sustainable Development Goal 11. In data engineering, imputation and the removal of outliers are very important steps prior to forecasting the concentration of air pollutants. For pollution and meteorological data, missing values and outliers are critical problems that need to be addressed. This paper proposes a novel method called multiple iterative imputation using autoencoder-based long short-term memory (MIA-LSTM) which uses iterative imputation using an extra tree regressor as an estimator for the missing values in multivariate data followed by an LSTM autoencoder for the detection and removal of outliers present in the dataset. The preprocessed data were given to a multivariate LSTM for forecasting PM2.5 concentration. This paper also presents the effect of removing outliers and missing values from the dataset as well as the effect of imputing missing values in the process of forecasting the concentrations of air pollutants. The proposed method provides better results for forecasting with a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 9.8883. The obtained results were compared with the traditional gated recurrent unit (GRU), 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) approaches for a dataset of the Aotizhonhxin area of Beijing in China.

Traditional PM2.5 monitoring uses ground -based monitoring stations with low spatial resolution. Other studies have retrieved the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aerosol optical depth product by the dark-target algorithm. However, the estimated PM2.5 concentration on the ground will produce missing values, which will lead to the reduction of spatial and temporal resolution. Based on this, this study proposes a machine learning algorithm to estimate PM2.5 by using the fifth generation reanalysis (ERA5) data set published by the European Center for Medium -range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In this study, two different methods of back propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) were used to develop the models. Firstly, the meteorological parameters (precipitable water vapor, water vapor pressure and relative humidity, etc.) and pollution parameters (O3, CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5) were used to establish PM2.5 model in 2021. The results showed that the R2 and RMSE for BPNN and RF were 0.94/0.96 and 10.37/8.77 mu g/m3, respectively. Then, due to the lack and the low spatial resolution of the pollution parameters, using only the ERA5 meteorological data with the high spatiotem-poral resolution to develop the PM2.5 model in winter, the R2 of the RF model (0.93) was 0.05 higher and the RMSE (12.50 mu g/m3) was 4.19 mu g/m3 lower than that of the BPNN model, which indicates that it is feasible to develop the PM2.5 model using only meteorological parameters. Finally, using the RF model of the second stage and ERA5 meteorological data with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees (obtained by cubic spline interpolation) to generate the hourly PM2.5 map of Beijing and compare it with China High Air Pollutants dataset, the R2 and RMSE of Beijing were 0.78 mu g/m3 and 14.85 mu g/m3, respectively. On this basis, it is found that the areas with high PM2.5 concen-tration are close to the areas with serious pollution in Hebei Province by analyzing the PM2.5 map of Beijing, and area transport and human activities are important sources of air pollution.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

The intercorrelation between multiple pollutant components and the extremely volatile PM pattern changes are the key impediments to effective prediction. For accurate PM forecasting with the benefit of federated learning, a new architecture incorporating seminal stacked long short-term memory networks (SS-LSTM) is presented in this research. The historical data are analyzed using SS-LSTM to reveal the location-aware behavior of PM, and a new prediction model is generated that takes into account the most prevalent pollutants and weather conditions. The stacking of LSTM units adds hierarchical levels of knowledge that help to tune the forecast model with the most appropriate weighting to the external features that contribute toward PM. The suggested SS-LSTM model is compared with traditional machine learning approaches and deep learning models to see how well it performs in predicting PM2.5 and PM10. The suggested strategy outperforms all other models tested in experiments carried out for the data collected from Delhi in India.

Owing to this, a lot of research and studies have been done to tackle this issue. However, most of the existing methodologies have several issues such as high cost, low deployment, maintenance capabilities and uni-or bi-variate concentration of air pollutants. In this paper, a hybrid CNN-LSTM model is presented to forecast multivariate air pollutant concentration for the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart city design. The amalgamation of CNN-LSTM acts as an encoder-decoder which improves the overall accuracy and precision. The performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM is compared with conventional and hybrid machine learning (ML) models on the basis of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Square Error (MSE). The proposed model outperforms various state-of-the-art ML models by generating an average MAE, MAPE and MSE of 54.80%, 52.78% and 60.02%. Furthermore, the predicted results are cross-validated with the actual concentration of air pollutants and the proposed model achieves a high degree of prediction accuracy to real-time air pollutants concentration. Moreover, a cross-grid cooperative scheme is proposed to tackle the IoT monitoring station malfunction scenario and make the pollutant monitoring more fault resistant and robust. The proposed scheme exploits the correlation between neighbouring monitoring stations and air pollutant concentration. The model generates an average MAPE and MSE of 10.90% and 12.02%, respectively.

Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the influence variables of the PM10 prediction model by using wrapper feature selection to compare the prediction model performance of different wrapper feature selection and to predict the concentration of PM10 for the next day. This research uses 10 years of daily data on pollutant concentrations from two stations (Klang and Shah Alam) obtained from the Department of Environment Malaysia (DOE) from 2009 until 2018. Six wrapper methods (forward selection, backward elimination, stepwise, brute-force, weight-guided and genetic algorithm evolution and the predictive analytics multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN)) were implemented in this study. This study found that brute-force is the dominant wrapper method in most of the best models in selecting important features for MLR. Moreover, compared to MLR, ANN provides more advantages regarding model accuracy and permits feature selection in predicting PM10.

Using samples that were collected at 220 locations over two seasons, quasi-ultrafine (PM0.2), accumulation mode fine (PM0.2-2.5), and coarse (PM2.5-10) particulate matter concentrations were used to develop spatiotemporal regression, machine learning models that enabled predictions of 24 elemental components in eight Southern California communities. We used supervised variable selection of over 150 variables, largely from publicly available sources, including meteorological, roadway and traffic characteristics, land use, and dispersion model estimates of traffic emissions. PM components that have high oxidative potential (and potentially large health effects) or are otherwise important markers for major PM sources were the primary focus. We present results for copper, iron, and zinc (as non-tailpipe vehicle emissions); elemental carbon (diesel emissions); vanadium (ship emissions); calcium (soil dust); and sodium (sea salt). Spatiotemporal linear regression models with 17 to 36 predictor variables including meteorology; distance to different classifications of roads; intersections and off ramps within a given buffer distance; truck and vehicle traffic volumes; and near-roadway dispersion model estimates produced superior predictions over the machine learning approaches (cross validation R-squares ranged from 0.76 to 0.92). Our models are easily interpretable and appear to have more effectively captured spatial gradients in the metallic portion of PM than other comparably large studies, particularly near roadways for the non-tailpipe emissions. Furthermore, we demonstrated the importance of including spatiotemporally resolved meteorology in our models as it helped to provide key insights into spatial patterns and allowed us to make temporal predictions.

For effective environmental management, this study aims to compare the performance of two classification algorithms in machine learning (logistic regression and naive bayes) and to evaluate the selection of the best algorithm for predicting the air quality class. Materials and methods: Pollutants data (PM10, SO2, NO2) have been collected from the Haldwani, Kashipur and Rudrapur regions in Uttarakhand (India). In part I of the study, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is calculated and assigned a class accordingly. In part II, the performance of algorithms is compared, and the air quality class is predicted through the best algorithm. In part III, accuracy is calculated after comparing the predicted class with the actual class. Then, it is compared with the accuracy of our selected algorithm. Results: The study finds a positive correlation between PM10 and SO2 pollutants. The result shows that the highest accuracy is achieved through logistic regression to predict the air quality class. Further, logistic regression has achieved the same accuracy i.e., 98.70% after comparing predicted values with the actual values. Conclusion: Logistic regression is the best algorithm to predict the air quality class in the regions of Uttarakhand, where pollutants are being measured in the GovernmentÂs hospital. The research also indicates that asthma patients in the Kashipur and Rudrapur regions may experience more health effects due to moderately polluted air quality; however, the situation is improving during the monsoon season.

Urban air quality maps are traditionally derived using measurements from fixed monitoring stations. Due to high cost, these stations are generally sparsely deployed in a few representative locations, leading to a highly generalized air quality map. In addition, urban air quality varies rapidly over short distances (&lt;1 km) and is influenced by meteorological conditions, road network and traffic flow. These variations are not well represented in coarse-grained air quality maps generated by conventional fixed-site monitoring methods but have important implications for characterizing heterogeneous personal air pollution exposures and identifying localized air pollution hotspots. Therefore, fine-grained urban air quality mapping is indispensable. In this context, supplementary low-cost mobile sensors make mobile air quality monitoring a promising alternative. Using sparse air quality measurements collected by mobile sensors and various contextual factors, especially traffic flow, we propose a context-aware locally adapted deep forest (CLADF) model to infer the distribution of NO2 by 100 m and 1 h resolution for fine-grained air quality mapping. The CLADF model exploits deep forest to construct a local model for each cluster consisting of nearest neighbor measurements in contextual feature space, and considers traffic flow as an important contextual feature. Extensive validation experiments were conducted using mobile NO2 measurements collected by 17 postal vans equipped with low-cost sensors operating in Antwerp, Belgium. The experimental results demonstrate that the CLADF model achieves the lowest RMSE as well as advances in accuracy and correlation, compared with various benchmark models, including random forest, deep forest, extreme gradient boosting and support vector regression.

Air pollution, especially PM2.5 resulting from industrialization, has fostered a wave of global weather migration and jeopardized human health in the past three decades. Taiwan has evolved as a highly developed economy and has a severe PM2.5 pollution problem. Thus, the control of PM2.5 is a critical issue for regulators, practitioners and academics. More recently, GA-SVM, an artificial-intelligence-based approach, has become a preferred prediction model, attributed to the advances in computer technology. However, hourly observation of PM2.5 concentration tends to present the GARCH effect. The objective of this study is to explore whether the integration of GA-SVM with the GARCH model can build a more accurate air pollution prediction model. The study adopts central Taiwan, the region with the worst level of PM2.5, as the source of observations. The empirical implementation of this study took a two-step approach; first, we examined the potential existence of the GARCH effect on the observed PM2.5 data. Second, we built a GA-SVM model integrated with the GARCH framework to predict the 8 h PM2.5 concentration of the sample region. The empirical results indicate that the prediction performance of our proposed alternative model out-performed the traditional SVM and GA-SVM models in terms of both MAPE and RMSE. The find-ings in this study provide evidence to support our expectation that adopting the SVM-based approach model for PM2.5 prediction is appropriate, and that prediction performance can be improved by integrating the GARCH model. Moreover, consistent with our prior expectation, the evidence further supports that taking the GARCH effect into account in the GA-SVM model significantly improves the accuracy of prediction. To the knowledge of the authors, this study is the first to at-tempt to integrate the GARCH effect into the GA-SVM model in the prediction of PM2.5. In sum-mary, with regard to the development of sustainability for both regulators and practitioners, our results strongly encourage them to take the GARCH effect into consideration in air pollution prediction if a regression-based model is to be adopted. Furthermore, this study may shed light on the application of the GARCH model and SVM models in the air pollution prediction literature. Â© 2022 by the authors.

As a result, accurate prediction is critical in human health management and government decision-making for environmental management. In this study, three artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, namely group method of data handling neural network (GMDHNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and gradient boosting regression (GBR) tree, are used to predict the hourly concentration of PM2.5 over a Dorset station located in Canada. The investigation has been performed to quantify the effect of data length on the AI modeling performance. Accordingly, nine different ratios (50/50, 55/45, 60/40, 65/35, 70/30, 75/25, 80/20, 85/15, and 90/10) are employed to split the data into training and testing datasets for assessing the performance of applied models. The results showed that the data division significantly impacted the model's capacity, and the 60/40 ratio was found more suitable for developing predictive models. Furthermore, the results showed that the ELM model provides more precise predictions of PM2.5 concentrations than the other models. Also, a vital feature of the ELM model is its ability to adapt to the potential changes in training and testing data ratio. To summarize, the results reported in this study demonstrated an efficient method for selecting the optimal dataset ratios and the best AI model to predict properly which would be helpful in the design of an accurate model for solving different environmental issues.

However, like other deep learning models, the lack of explainability is becoming a major drawback for GNNs, especially in health-related applications such as air pollution estimation, where a model's predictions might directly affect humans' health and habits. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc explainability framework for GNN-based models. More concretely, we propose a novel topology-aware kernelised node selection method, which we apply over the graph structural and air pollution information. Thanks to the proposed model, we are able to effectively capture the graph topology and, for a certain graph node, infer its most relevant nodes. Additionally, we propose a novel topological node embedding for each node, capturing in a vector-shape the graph walks with respect to every other graph node. To prove the effectiveness of our explanation method, we include commonly employed evaluation metrics as well as fidelity, sparsity and contrastivity, and adapt them to evaluate explainability on a regression task. Extensive experiments on two real-world air pollution data sets demonstrate and visually show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper aims to investigate the effects traffic data set have on the performance of machine learning (ML) predictive models in AQ prediction. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this, the authors have set up an experiment with the control data set having only the AQ data set and meteorological (Met) data set, while the experimental data set is made up of the AQ data set, Met data set and traffic data set. Several ML models (such as extra trees regressor, eXtreme gradient boosting regressor, random forest regressor, K-neighbors regressor and two others) were trained, tested and compared on these individual combinations of data sets to predict the volume of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 in the atmosphere at various times of the day. Findings: The result obtained showed that various ML algorithms react differently to the traffic data set despite generally contributing to the performance improvement of all the ML algorithms considered in this study by at least 20% and an error reduction of at least 18.97%. Research limitations/implications: This research is limited in terms of the study area, and the result cannot be generalized outside of the UK as some of the inherent conditions may not be similar elsewhere. Additionally, only the ML algorithms commonly used in literature are considered in this research, therefore, leaving out a few other ML algorithms. Practical implications: This study reinforces the belief that the traffic data set has a significant effect on improving the performance of air pollution ML prediction models. Hence, there is an indication that ML algorithms behave differently when trained with a form of traffic data set in the development of an AQ prediction model. This implies that developers and researchers in AQ prediction need to identify the ML algorithms that behave in their best interest before implementation. Originality/value: The result of this study will enable researchers to focus more on algorithms of benefit when using traffic data sets in AQ prediction.

When it comes to climate sustainability, air pollution is a major challenge. Because of the distinctive nature, unpredictability, and great changeability in the reality of toxins and particulates, detecting air quality is a puzzling task. Simultaneously, the ability to predict or classify and monitor air quality is becoming increasingly important, particularly in urban areas, due to the well documented negative impact of air pollution on residentÂs health and the environment. To better comprehend the current condition of air quality, this research proposes predicting air pollution levels from real-time data. This study proposes the use of deep learning techniques to forecast air pollution levels. Layers, activation functions, and a number of epochs were used to create the suggested Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network based neural layer design. The use of proposed Deep Learning as a structure for high-accuracy air quality prediction is investigated in this research and obtained better accuracy of nearly 82% compared to earlier records.

Air pollution data for most regions of China have a close correlation with time and seasons and are affected by multidimensional factors such as meteorology and air quality. In contrast with classical peaks-over-threshold modeling approaches, we use a deep learning technique and three new dynamic conditional generalized Pareto distribution (DCP) models with weather and air quality factors for fitting the time-dependence of the air pollutant concentration and make statistical inferences about their application in air quality analysis. Specifically, in the proposed three DCP models, a dynamic autoregressive exponential function mechanism is applied for the time-varying scale parameter and tail index of the conditional generalized Pareto distribution, and a sufficiently high threshold is chosen using two threshold selection procedures. The probabilistic properties of the DCP model and the statistical properties of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are investigated, simulating and showing the stability and sensitivity of the MLE estimations. The three proposed models are applied to fit the PM2.5 time series in Beijing from 2015 to 2021. Real data are used to illustrate the advantages of the DCP, especially compared to the estimation volatility of GARCH and AIC or BIC criteria. The DCP model involving both the mixed weather and air quality factors performs better than the other two models with weather factors or air quality factors alone.

Many prediction methods have been proposed in recent years to improve the prediction accuracy. However, most of the existing methods either did not consider the spatial relationships between monitoring stations or overlooked the strength of the correlation. Excluding the spatial correlation or including too much weak spatial inputs could influence the modeling and reduce the prediction accuracy. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes a correlation filtered spatial-temporal long short-term memory (CFST-LSTM) model for air quality prediction. The model is designed based on the original LSTM model and is equipped with a spatial-temporal filter (STF) layer. This layer not only takes into account the spatial influence between stations, but also can extract highly correlated sequential data and drop weaker ones. To evaluate the proposed CFST-LSTM model, hourly PM2.5 concentration data of California are collected and preprocessed. Several experiments are conducted. The experimental results show that the CFST-LSTM model can effectively improve the prediction accuracy and has great generalization.

This unit was developed using the NodeMCU-32S microcontroller, PMS5003-G5 (particulate matter sensing module), and Ublox NEO-6M V2 (GPS positioning module). The sensing unit transmits data of the particulate matter concentration and coordinates of a polluted location to the backend server through 3G and 4G telecommunication networks for data collection. This system will complement the governmentÂs PM2.5 data acquisition system. Mobile monitoring stations meet the air pollution monitoring needs of some areas that require special observation. For example, an AIoT development system will be installed. At intersections with intensive traffic, it can be used as a reference for government transportation departments or environmental inspection departments for environmental quality monitoring or evacuation of traffic flow. Furthermore, the particulate matter distributions in three areas, namely Xinzhuang, Sanchong, and Luzhou Districts, which are all in New Taipei City of Taiwan, were estimated using machine learning models, the data of stationary monitoring stations, and the measurements of the mobile sensing system proposed in this study. Four types of learning models were trained, namely the decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and radial basis function neural network, and their prediction results were evaluated. The root mean square error was used as the performance indicator, and the learning results indicate that the random forest model outperforms the other models for both the training and testing sets. To examine the generalizability of the learning models, the models were verified in relation to data measured on three days: 15 February, 28 February, and 1 March 2019. A comparison between the model predicted and the measured data indicates that the random forest model provides the most stable and accurate prediction values and could clearly present the distribution of highly polluted areas. The results of these models are visualized in the form of maps by using a web application. The maps allow users to understand the distribution of polluted areas intuitively. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Studies have attempted to capture features of air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using land use regression models, but this method overlooks the multi-collinearity of factors, non-linear correlations between factors and air pollutants, and it fails to perform well when processing daily data. However, machine learning is a feasible approach for establishing persuasive intra-urban air pollution daily variation models. In this article, random forest is utilised to establish intra-urban PM2.5 and NO2 spatial-temporal variation models and is compared to the traditional land use regression method. Taking the city of Shanghai, China as the case area, 36 station-measured daily records in two and a half years of PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were collected. And over 80 different predictors associated with meteorological and geographical conditions, transportation, community population density, land use and points of interest are used to construct the land use regression and random forest models. Results from the two methods are compared and impacting factors identified. Explained variance (R2) is used to quantify and compare model performance. The final land use regression model explains 49.3% and 42.2% of the spatial variation in ambient PM2.5 and NO2, respectively, whereas the random forest model explains 78.1% and 60.5% of the variance. Regression mappings for unsampled sites on a grid pattern of 1 km Ã 1 km are also implemented. The random forest model is shown to perform much better than the land use regression model. In general, the findings suggest that the random forest approach offers a robust improvement in predicting performance compared to the land use regression model in estimating daily spatial variations in ambient PM2.5 and NO2.

The monitoring process is composed of data collection, evaluation, and decision-making. Several important pollutants, such as SO2, CO, PM10, O3, NOx, H2S, location, and many others, have important effects on air quality. Air quality should be recorded and measured based on the total effect of pollutants that are collectively prescribed by a numerical value. In Canada, the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is used which is one numerical value based on the total effect of some concentrations. Therefore, evolution is required to consider the complex, ill-defined air pollutants, hence several naive and noble approaches are used to study AQHI. In this study, three approaches such as hybrid data-driven ANN, nonlinear autoregressive with external (exogenous) input (NARX) with a neural network, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference (ANFIS) approaches are used for estimating the air quality in an urban area (Jeddah city-industrial zone) for public health concerns. Over three years, 1771 data were collected for pollutants from 1 June 2016 until 30 September 2019. In this study, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) approach was employed as an optimization method for ANNs to solve the nonlinear least-squares problems. The NARX employed has a two-layer feed-forward ANN. On the other hand, the back-propagation multi-layer perceptron (BPMLP) algorithm was used with the steepest descent approach to reduce the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSEs were 4.42, 0.0578, and 5.64 for ANN, NARX, and ANFIS, respectively. Essentially, all RMSEs are very small. The outcomes of approaches were evaluated by fuzzy quality charts and compared statistically with the US-EPA air quality standards. Due to the effectiveness and robustness of artificial intelligent techniques, the publicÂs early warning will be possible for avoiding the harmful effects of pollution inside the urban areas, which may reduce respiratory and cardiovascular mortalities. Consequently, the stability of air quality models was correlated with the absolute air quality index. The findings showed notable performance of NARX with a neural network, ANN, and ANFIS-based AQHI model for high dimensional data assessment. Â© 2021 by the authors.

However, the ability to conduct epidemiological assessments can be limited due to challenges in generating reliable PM2.5 estimates, particularly in parts of the world such as the Middle East where measurements are scarce and extreme meteorological events such as sandstorms are frequent. In order to supplement exposure modeling efforts under such conditions, satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) has proven to be useful due to its global coverage. By using AODs from the Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) of the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) combined with meteorological and assimilated aerosol information from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), we constructed machine learning models to predict PM2.5 in the area surrounding the Persian Gulf, including Kuwait, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E). Our models showed regional differences in predictive performance, with better results in the U.A.E. (median test R2 = 0.66) than Kuwait (median test R2 = 0.51). Variable importance also differed by region, where satellite-retrieved AOD variables were more important for predicting PM2.5 in Kuwait than in the U.A.E. Divergent trends in the temporal and spatial autocorrelations of PM2.5 and AOD in the two regions offered possible explanations for differences in predictive performance and variable importance. In a test of model transferability, we found that models trained in one region and applied to another did not predict PM2.5 well, even if the transferred model had better performance. Overall the results of our study suggest that models developed over large geographic areas could generate PM2.5 estimates with greater uncertainty than could be obtained by taking a regional modeling approach. Furthermore, development of methods to better incorporate spatial and temporal autocorrelations in machine learning models warrants further examination. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Nevertheless, the relationship between AOD and ground-level PM2.5 varies spatiotemporally and differences related to spatial domains, temporal schemes, and seasonal variations must be assessed. Here, an ensemble multiple linear regression (EMLR) model and an ensemble neural network (ENN) model were developed to estimate PM2.5 levels in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA), the second largest urban center in Mexico. Four AOD-SDSs (Scientific Datasets) from MODIS Collection 6 were tested using three spatial domains and two temporal schemes. The best model performance was obtained using AOD at 0.55 Âµm from MODIS-Aqua at a spatial resolution of 3 km, along meteorological parameters and daily scheme. EMLR yielded a correlation coefficient (R) of ~0.57 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of ~7.00 Âµg m?3 . ENN performed better than EMLR, with an R of ~0.78 and RMSE of ~5.43 Âµg m?3 . Satellite-derived AOD in combination with meteorology data allowed for the estimation of PM2.5 distributions in an urban area with low air quality monitor density. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Simultaneously, the classical linear model cannot obtain satisfactory performance due to nonlinearity and multicomponent characteristics. Based on the data-driven mechanism, this paper proposes a deep learning method coupled with Bayesian optimization based on wavelet decomposition to model the time series data and forecasting its trend. Firstly, the data is decomposed by wavelet transform to reduce the complexity of the time series data. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network is trained as a submodel for each decomposition component. The hyperparameters of wavelet decomposition and each submodel are optimized with Bayesian sequence model-based optimization (SMBO) to develop the modeling accuracy. Finally, the results of all submodels are added to obtain forecasting results. The PM2.5 data collected by the US Air Quality Monitoring Station is used for experiments. By comparing with other networks, it can be found that the proposed method outperforms well in the multisteps forecasting task for the complex time series.

Due to the limitations of missing values in aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, the reconstruction of full-coverage PM2.5 concentration remains challenging. In this study, we present a two-stage daily adaptive modeling framework, based on machine learning, to solve this problem. We built the annual models in the first stage, then daily models were constructed in the second stage based on the output of the annual models, which incorporated the parameter and feature adaptive tuning strategy. Within this study, PM2.5 concentrations were adaptively modeled and reconstructed daily based on the multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) AOD products and other ancillary data, such as meteorological factors, population, and elevation. Our model validation showed excellent performance with an overall R2 = 0.91 and RMSE = 9.91 ?g/m3 for the daily models, along with the site-based cross-validation R2s and RMSEs of 0.86Â0.87 and 12Â12.33 ?g/m3; these results indicated the reliability and feasibility of the proposed approach. The daily full-coverage PM2.5 concentrations at 1 km resolution across China during the Three-Year Blue-Sky Action Plan were reconstructed in this study. We analyzed the distribution and variations of reconstructed PM2.5 at three different time scales. Overall, national PM2.5 pollution has significantly improved with the annual average concentration dropping from 33.67Â28.03 ?g/m3, which demonstrated that air pollution control policies are effective and beneficial. However, some areas still have severe PM2.5 pollution problems that cannot be ignored. In conclusion, the approach proposed in this study can accurately present daily full-coverage PM2.5 concentrations and the research outcomes could provide a reference for subsequent air pollution prevention and control decision-making.

However, they are often given at coarse frequencies (ÂsnapshotÂ, daily or even longer), limiting their applications in epidemiological studies and assessing the evolution of NO2 pollution. This study investigated the potential applicability of Himawari-8 derived hourly fine particulate matter concentrations in producing hourly NO2 concentrations by constructing a space-time ensemble model. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, one of the serious pollution regions in China, is the study region chosen. The proposed model performs well in estimating hourly NO2 concentration with a high cross-validation (CV) coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.81) and low CV root-mean-square (RMSE = 9.71 ?g/m3), mean prediction errors (MPE = 6.33 ?g/m3), and relative prediction errors (RPE = 22.5%). On daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales, CV R2 increases to 0.89, 0.93, 0.97, and 0.99, respectively. The annual mean model estimated NO2 concentration over BTH region is 28.2 Â± 6.5 ?g/m3, with relatively higher NO2 concentrations are seen in southern and southeastern BTH. Winter experiences the most severe NO2 concentrations, followed by autumn, spring, and summer. Surface NO2 concentrations are higher (lower) in the morning (afternoon) and tend to decrease gradually with time. The model generally captures the hourly evolution of NO2 concentrations for the severe pollution episode but shows some underestimations. The annual mean NO2 concentrations were 2.8% lower on the weekend than on weekdays. In addition, the weekend effects of NO2 concentrations are larger at rush hour and lower in the noon. The hourly NO2 products derived from proposed approach are potentially useful for improving our understanding of the source, evolution, and transportation behavior of NO2 pollution episodes and for exposure- and health-related research. The proposed approach also enriches the potential applications of geostationary satellites (e.g., Himawari-8).

Current deterministic models rely on numerical simulation and the tuning of parameters, and empirical models present powerful learning ability but have not fully considered the temporal periodicity of air pollutants. In order to take the periodicity of pollutants into empirical air quality forecasting models, this study evaluates the temporal variations of air pollutants and develops a novel sequence to sequence model with weekly periodicity to forecast air quality. Two-year observation data from Shanghai roadside air quality monitoring stations are employed to support analyzing and modeling. The results conclude that the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations show obvious daily and weekly variations, and the temporal patterns are nearly consistent with the periodicity of traffic flow in Shanghai. Compared with PM2.5, the CO concentrations are more affected by traffic variation. The proposed model outperforms the baseline model in terms of accuracy, and presents a higher linear consistency in PM2.5 prediction and lower errors in CO prediction. This study could assist environmental researchers to further improve the technologies for urban air quality forecasting, and serve as tools for supporting policymakers to implement related traffic management and emission control policies.

Initially, a RF model of the pollutant is built and analysed in relation to the meteorological variables.

However, these products generally have coarse resolutions, limiting the ability to evaluate PM2.5 concentrations in urban regions where the human activities are relatively high. This study first develops an ensemble machine learning approach to produce PM2.5 concentrations with an extremely high spatial resolution of 250 m, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements of top-of-atmosphere reflectance and related meteorological variables. The Yangtze River Delta region, with one of the highest levels of PM2.5 pollution in China, is the study region chosen. The model shows a very high and stable performance with a coefficient of determination ( R2) of 0.90, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 12.0?g/m3, a mean prediction error (MPE) of 7.8?g/m3, and a mean relative prediction error (RPE) 16.9% for sample-based cross validation. The model can accurately capture the distribution patterns and magnitudes of PM2.5 concentrations over the study region for seasonal mean, daily variations, and different levels of air pollution. The very high resolution of the model has the advantage of capturing the uneven spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations at small spatial scales and identifying small areas with very high PM2.5 concentrations, offering a possible approach for locating the sources of PM2.5 emissions. In general, the model developed here estimates very well PM2.5 concentrations at a very high spatial resolution, providing detailed information, useful for air-pollution-related studies, as well as pollution monitoring and evaluation by governments, especially in urban and urban-center areas.

The success of these deep learning models heavily depends on the two key factors viz. proper representation of the input data and preservation of temporal order of the input data during the featureÂs extraction phase. Here we propose a hybrid deep neural network (HDNN) framework to forecast the PM2.5 by integrating two popular deep learning architectures, viz. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BDLSTM) network. Here we build a 3D input tensor so that CNN can extract the trends and spatial features more accurately within the input window. Here we also introduce a linking layer between CNN and BDLSTM to maintain the temporal ordering of feature vectors.

One of the typical meteorological phenomena seducing PM2.5 concentrations to accumulate is temperature inversion which forms a warm-air cap to blockade the surface pollutants from dissipating. This paper analyzes the meteorological patterns which coincide with temperature inversion and proposes two machine learning classifiers for temperature inversion classification.

In this scenario, it is of paramount importance to monitor and predict PM concentration. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are commonly used to forecast air pollution levels due to their accuracy. The use of partition on prediction problems is well known because decomposition of time series allows the latent components of the original series to be revealed. It is a matter of extracting the ""deterministic"" component, which is easy to predict the random components. However, there is no evidence of its use in air pollution forecasting. In this work, we introduce a different approach consisting of the decomposition of the time series in contiguous monthly partitions, aiming to develop specialized predictors to solve the problem because air pollutant concentration has seasonal behavior. The goal is to reach prediction accuracy higher than those obtained by using the entire series. Experiments were performed for seven time series of daily particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5 and PM10-particles with diameter less than 2.5 and 10 micrometers, respectively) in Finland and Brazil, using four ANNs: multilayer perceptron, radial basis function, extreme learning machines, and echo state networks. The experimental results using three evaluation measures showed that the proposed methodology increased all models' prediction capability, leading to higher accuracy compared to the traditional approach, even for extremely high air pollution events. Our study has an important contribution to air quality prediction studies. It can help governments take measures aiming air pollution reduction and preparing hospitals during extreme air pollution events, which is related to the following United Nations sustainable developments goals: SDG 3-good health and well-being and SDG 11-sustainable cities and communities.

One of its main components, particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter of <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), can be inhaled and deposited in deeper regions of the respiratory system, causing adverse effects on human health, which are even more harmful to children. In this sense, the use of deterministic and stochastic models has become a key tool for predicting atmospheric behavior and, thus, providing information for decision makers to adopt preventive actions to mitigate air pollution impacts. However, stochastic models present their own strengths and weaknesses. To overcome some of disadvantages of deterministic models, there has been an increasing interest in the use of deep learning, due to its simpler implementation and its success on multiple tasks, including time series and air quality forecasting. Thus, the objective of the present study is to develop and evaluate the use of four different topologies of deep artificial neural networks (DNNs), analyzing the impact of feature augmentation in the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations by using five levels of discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

This model consists of the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the bi-directional long short-term memory neural network (Bi LSTM). CBAM is applied to the extraction of feature relationships between pollutant data and meteorological data and assists in deeply obtaining the spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 concentrations.

The 10-fold cross-validation (CV) evaluation was employed to evaluate the 24-hour and continuous ground-level PM2.5 estimations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during 2018. The results showed that the autogeoi-stacking model performed well in the study area with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.88, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of 17.38 Âµg/m3, and the mean absolute error (MAE) of 10.71 Âµg/m3. The estimated PM2.5 concentrations had an excellent performance during the day (8:00Â18:00, local time) and night (19:00Â07:00) (the cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2): 0.90, 0.88), and captured hourly PM2.5 variations well, even in the severe ambient air pollution event. On the seasonal scale, the R2 values from high to low were winter, autumn, spring, and summer, respectively. Compared with the original stacking model, the improvement of R2 with the autofeat and hyperparameter optimization approaches was up to 5.33%. In addition, the annual mean values indicated that the southern areas, such as Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, and Handan, suffered higher PM2.5 concentrations. The northern regions (e.g., Zhangjiakou and Chengde) experienced low PM2.5. In summary, the proposed method in this paper performed well and could provide ideas for constructing geoi-features and spatiotemporally continuous inversion products of PM2.5.

The satellite-based top-down method can provide near-real-time constraints on emissions; however, its efficiency is largely limited by efforts in dealing with the complex emission-concentration response. Here, we propose a novel machine-learning-based method using a physically informed variational autoencoder (VAE) emission predictor to infer NOxemissions from satellite-retrieved surface NO2concentrations. The computational burden can be significantly reduced with the help of a neural network trained with a chemical transport model, allowing the VAE emission predictor to provide a timely estimation of posterior emissions based on the satellite-retrieved surface NO2concentration. The VAE emission predictor successfully corrected the underestimation of NOxemissions in rural areas and the overestimation in urban areas, resulting in smaller normalized mean biases (reduced from -0.8 to -0.4) and larger R2values (increased from 0.4 to 0.7). The interpretability of the VAE emission predictor was investigated using sensitivity analysis by modulating each feature, indicating that NO2concentration and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height are important for estimating NOxemissions, which is consistent with our common knowledge. The advantages of the VAE emission predictor in efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy demonstrate its great potential in estimating the latest emissions and evaluating the control effectiveness from observations.

The proposed TDGTN comprises of encoder and decoder layers associated with the developed graph attention mechanism. In particular, considering the similarity of different time moments and the importance of temporal difference between two adjacent moments for air quality PM2.5prediction, we first construct graph-structured data from original time series PM2.5 data at different moments without explicit graph structure. Then we improve the self-attention mechanism with the temporal difference information, and develop a new graph attention mechanism. Finally, the developed graph attention mechanism is embedded into the encoder and decoder layers of the proposed TDGTN to learn long-term temporal dependencies and complex relationships from a graph prospective on air quality PM2.5 prediction tasks.

However, the effects of meteorological factors, which significantly affect the dispersion of air pollution, on the urban-form-air-quality relationship have not been understood on a granular level. We attempt to fill this gap by developing predictive models of particulate matter (PM) in the Bronx (New York City) using meteorological and urban form parameters. The granular PM data was collected by mobile low-cost sensors as the ground truth. To evaluate the effects of meteorological factors, we compared the performance of models using the urban form within fixed and wind-sensitive buffers, respectively. We find better predictive power in the wind-sensitive group (R = 0.85) for NC10(number concentration for particles with diameters of 1 ?m-10 ?m) than the control group (R = 0.01), and modest improvements for PM2.5(R = 0.84 for the wind sensitive group, R = 0.77 for the control group), indicating that incorporating meteorological factors improved the predictive power of our models. We also found that urban form factors account for 62.95% of feature importance for NC10and 14.90% for PM2.5(9.99% and 4.91% for 3-D and 2-D urban form factors, respectively) in our Random Forest models. It suggests the importance of incorporating urban form factors, especially for the uncommonly used 3-D characteristics, in estimating intraurban PM. Our method can be applied in other cities to better capture the influence of urban context on PM levels. Â© 2022 American Chemical Society.

However, the existing satellite and ground observation methods are not enough to effectively monitor the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of near-surface NO2 concentrations, which limits the development of pollutant remediation work and medical health research. Based on TROPOMI-NO2 tropospheric column concentration data, supplemented by meteorological data, atmospheric condition reanalysis data and other geographic parameters, combined with classic machine learning models and deep learning networks, we constructed an ensemble model that achieved a daily average near-surface NO2 of 0.03Â° exposure. In this article, a meteorological hysteretic effects term and a spatiotemporal term were designed, which considera-bly improved the performance of the model. Overall, our ensemble model performed better, with a 10-fold CV R2 of 0.89, an RMSE of 5.62 Âµg/m3, and an MAE of 4.04 Âµg/m3. The model also had good temporal and spatial generalization capability, with a temporal prediction R2 and a spatial prediction R2 of 0.71 and 0.81, respectively, which can be applied to a wider range of time and space. Finally, we used an ensemble model to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of NO2 in a coastal region of southeastern China from May 2018 to December 2020. Compared with satellite observa-tions, the model output results showed richer details of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of NO2 concentrations. Due to the advantages of using multi-source data, this model framework has the potential to output products with a higher spatial resolution and can provide a reference for downscaling work on other pollutants.

Furthermore, with the development of industry and technology, rapid population growth, and the massive expansion of cities, the total amount of pollution emissions continue to increase. Hence, observing and predicting the air quality index (AQI), which measures fatal pollutants to humans, has become more and more critical in recent years. However, there are insufficient air quality monitoring stations for AQI observation because the construction and maintenance costs are too high. In addition, finding an available and suitable place for monitoring stations in cities with high population density is difficult. This study proposes a spatial-temporal model to predict the long-term AQI in a city without monitoring stations. Our model calculates the spatial-temporal correlation between station and region using an attention mechanism and leverages the distance information between all existing monitoring stations and target regions to enhance the effectiveness of the attention structure. Furthermore, we design a hybrid predictor that can effectively combine the time-dependent and time-independent predictors using the dynamic weighted sum.

Reliable evaluation of changes in pollutants due to altered emissions requires considering meteorological and other variability influencing concentrations. Here, a combination of ensemble learning, competitive learning and unsupervised clustering is proposed and applied to leverage the change analysis of particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms Random Forest (RF) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) were trained with historical meteorological data, pollutant concentrations and traffic indicators. The importance of different variables for local PM2.5 was determined with RF. SOM was configured for multivariable cluster analysis. The trained SOM enabled predicting a cluster for new data representing conditions with shifted anthropogenic activity. The prediction forms a benchmark for the analysed period with maximized meteorological similarity, which facilitates identifying changes in ambient pollutants due to changed emissions. The method was applied to data from the start of COVID-19 pandemic, 3/2020, when emissions suddenly decreased. For measurements from Helsinki, Finland, the SOM yielded a statistically significant change in PM2.5 (?0.7%), NO2 (?33%) and O3 (+17%). Comparing data from 3/2020 to data from 3/2017Â2019 produced different results (PM2.5 ?1.7%, NO2 ?37%, O3 ?4.0%). Statistical indicators confirmed better compatibility between the analysed period and its benchmark when using the SOM prediction instead of calendar-based selection: Average RMSRE was 19%-points lower and Willmott's dr 41% higher with SOM than with 3/2017Â2019.

This is implemented and evaluated in a study case of Chengdu (4900 km2, 14 June to 14 July 2018), which achieves map-recovery of PM2.5 distribution based upon the sparse measurements (ca. 16.2% space-time coverage) with high-performance (symmetric mean average percentage error (SMAPE) (%) = 14.13%; R2 = 0.94). Detailed evaluations are presented through the analysis of model performance, space-time coverage of mobile sampling, and AQ inference. We conduct a series of sensitivity analyses of mobile sampling coverage, and the experimental results show that it is a critical issue to enhance the model trust, which contributes to improve the R-square from 0.81 (fixed data + 10% mobile data) to 0.94 (fixed data + 100% mobile data). The results show that the mobile sampling significantly improves the space-time modeling capability, and our proposed model has great potential to achieve map-recovery for air pollution at high spatial-temporal resolution with high performance.

Accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration can help the government to effectively reduce the damage caused by haze events. The prediction of PM2.5 concentration using deep learning models has gradually become a research hotspot. For predicting PM2.5 concentration considering the non-Euclidean distribution characteristics of air quality monitoring stations and the time-series characteristics of pollutant concentration data, a hybrid model combining multi-graph convolution and Long Short-Term Memory network (MGC-LSTM) was proposed in this study, based on the six pollutant concentration data of CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2. Two different methods are used in the study to construct adjacency matrices to build multiple graphs composed of stations, and then, the two matrices were fused into a new graph. We use the adjacency matrix of the new graph and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to extract spatial features of the input data, and then transfer the results of GCN into Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) to obtain the predicted values of PM2.5 concentration. This empirical study shows that the newly constructed model makes full use of spatiotemporal information and has higher prediction accuracy compared with that of the comparison model.

Due to poor quality of air, unhealthy lifestyle and premature deaths of humans have arisen in India, especially in Delhi. Not only has a humanÂs health, but the air pollution also made a huge impact on several areas like economy, agriculture and road accidents, etc. In recent times, deep learning (DL) technologies are influenced every application rapidly even in air pollution prediction. In this work, the novel optimised DL algorithms are proposed for the efficient prediction of air quality particularly focussing on Chennai, Tamil Nadu. To provide higher accuracy in air quality prediction, the novel optimised DL algorithms are proposed which is combined several models like ARIMA and CNN-LSTM and Tuna Optimization Algorithm, respectively. Initially, CNN and LSTM are combined to provide hybrid architecture. Next, the metaheuristics-based tuna swarm optimization model is applied for fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the CNN-LSTM model which is known as the Tuna Optimised CNN-LSTM (TOCL) method. Finally, the novel TOCL is applied to the residuals of the ARIMA model to form an ARIMA- TOCL (ARTOCL) model. As a result, the novel ARTOCL is learned and performed with an optimal air quality prediction. The metrics of the Hybrid ARTOCL model are evaluated as a better mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R2 score and the normalized RMSE (nRMSE) with higher accuracy than the previous models. The results show that the proposed prediction model has 22.6% R2 improvement, 14.6% MAE reductions, 22% RMSE reductions and 16.45% nRMSE reductions than the existing models.

The research has been realized with the application of different statistical parameters, synoptic meteorology tools, the Random Forests machine learning method, and multilinear regression analyses. Another aim of the research was to evaluate the types of atmospheric circulation classification methods used in studies on air pollution dispersion and to assess the possibility of their application in air quality management, including short-term PM10 daily forecasts. During the period analyzed, a significant decreasing trend of pollutants' concentrations and varying atmospheric circulation conditions was observed. To understand the relation between PM10 concentration and meteorological conditions and their significance, the Random Forests algorithm was applied. Observations from meteorological stations, air quality measurements and ERA-5 reanalysis were used. The meteorological database was used as an input to models that were trained to predict daily PM10 concentration and its day-to-day changes. This study made it possible to distinguish the dominant circulation types with the highest probability of occurrence of poor air quality or a significant improvement in air quality conditions. Apart from the parameters whose significant influence on air quality is well established (air temperature and wind speed at the ground and air temperature gradient), the key factor was also the gradient of relative air humidity and wind shear in the lowest troposphere. Partial dependence calculated with the use of the Random Forests model made it possible to better analyze the impact of individual meteorological parameters on the PM10 daily concentration. The analysis has shown that, for areas with a diversified topography, it is crucial to use the variability of the atmospheric circulation during the day to better forecast air quality.",SUSTAINABILITY,10.3390/su14063388,4,2,Yes,"LR,RF",,No,Poland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next, ISSA algorithm is employed to optimize the hyperparameters of LSTM, further improving the model’s performance. Finally, LSTM model is utilized to predict AQI concentrations. Through comparative experiments, it is demonstrated that the ISSA–LSTM model outperforms other models in terms of RMSE and R2, exhibiting higher prediction accuracy.

To maintain ambient air quality, regular monitoring and forecasting of air pollution is necessary. For that purpose, machine learning has emerged as a promising technique for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) compared to conventional methods. Here we apply the AQI to the city of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India, focusing on 12 contaminants and 10 meteorological parameters from July 2017 to September 2022. For this purpose, we employed several machine learning models, including LightGBM, Random Forest, Catboost, Adaboost, and XGBoost.

This study develops a model that combines an attention mechanism, convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) unit to predict the O3 and PM2.5 levels in the atmosphere, as well as an air quality index (AQI). The prediction results given by the proposed model are compared with those from CNN-LSTM and LSTM models as well as random forest and support vector regression models. The proposed model achieves a correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed values of more than 0.90, outperforming the other four models. The model errors are also consistently lower when using the proposed approach. Sobol-based sensitivity analysis is applied to identify the variables that make the greatest contribution to the model prediction results. Taking the COVID-19 outbreak as the time boundary, we find some homology in the interactions among the pollutants and meteorological factors in the atmosphere during different periods. Solar irradiance is the most important factor for O3, CO is the most important factor for PM2.5, and particulate matter has the most significant effect on AQI. The key influencing factors are the same over the whole phase and before the COVID-19 outbreak, indicating that the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on AQI gradually stabilized.

Currently, most of the studies only provide air pollution forecasts on single or multiple sites, rather than citywide information. Due to complex urban structure and spatial transportation of air pollutants, the distribution of citywide air quality can be highly varying, which makes it extremely challenging to make accurate forecasts. Here, we address this challenge by exploring the potential of combining the dense air quality monitoring data with the deep learning technique. By using the fine-granular PM2.5 concentrations data collected from 417 micro monitoring stations in Lanzhou City, China, we proposed an end-to-end method to predict future citywide PM2.5 concentrations at 500 m × 500 m × 1 h resolution. This method consists of a spatio-temporal transformation component and a spatio-temporal prediction component, of which the former is responsible for converting PM2.5 concentration data into spatial-maps, while the spatio-temporal prediction network (i.e., Air-PredNet in our study) based on ConvLSTM in the latter is responsible for capturing the spatio-temporal characterizations in the spatial-map sequences and finally generating citywide air quality forecasts. The results show that our method can accurately predict the spatial distribution and variations of PM2.5 concentration with an RMSE of 2.12 μg/m3 for 1-h prediction and an RMSE of 4.09 μg/m3 for 6-h prediction. In addition, we also proved the robustness of Air-PredNet based on the prediction performance for O3 and NO2.

Scholars have, thus, proposed a variety of models and techniques for predicting air pollution.

This paper offers a DW-CAE model that may strike a balance between overall accuracy and local univariate prediction accuracy in order to observe the trend of air pollution more comprehensively. The model combines deep learning and signal processing techniques by employing discrete wavelet transform to obtain the high and low-frequency features of the target sequence, designing a feature extraction module to capture the relationship between the variables, and feeding the resulting feature matrix to an LSTM-based autoencoder for prediction. The DW-CAE model was used to make predictions on the Beijing (Formula presented.) dataset and the Yining air pollution dataset, and its prediction accuracy was compared to that of eight baseline models, such as LSTM, IMV-Full, and DARNN. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed DW-CAE model is more accurate than other baseline models at predicting single and multiple pollution factors, and the R2 of each variable is all higher than 93% for the overall prediction of the six air pollutants.

Many of the cities which are developed suffered from severe air quality (AQ) because of the rapid growth in industrialization and population.

The analysis and prediction results demonstrated that the MJO improved the predictive skill of the extended-range PM2.5 forecast. The MJO indexes, namely, real-time multivariate MJO series 1 (RMM1) and real-time multivariate MJO series 2 (RMM2), ranked the first, and seventh, respectively, in terms of the predictive contribution of all meteorological predictors. When the MJO was not introduced, the correlation coefficients for the forecasts on lead times of 11–40 days ranged from 0.27 to 0.55, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranged from 23.4 to 31.8 μg/m3. After the MJO was introduced, the correlation coefficients for the 11–40 day forecast ranged from 0.31 to 0.56, among which those for the 16–40 day forecast substantially improved, and the RMSEs ranged from 23.2 to 28.7 μg/m3. When comparing the prediction scores, such as percent correct (PC), critical success index (CSI), and equitable threat score (ETS), the forecast model was more accurate when it introduced the MJO. A novel aspect of this study is to investigate the effects of the MJO mechanism on the meteorological conditions of air pollution in eastern China through advanced regression analysis. The MJO indexes RMM1 and RMM2 considerably impacted the geopotential height field of 28°–40° at 300–250 hPa 45 days in advance. When RMM1 increased and RMM2 decreased 45 days in advance, the 500 hPa geopotential height field weakened accordingly, and the bottom of the 500 hPa trough moved southward; thus cold air was more easily transported southward and the upstream air pollutants were transported to eastern China. With a weak ground pressure field and dry air at low altitudes, the westerly wind component increased, which led to the easier formation of a weather configuration favorable for the accumulation and transport of air pollution, thus resulting in an increase in PM2.5 concentration in the region. These findings can guide forecasters regarding the utility of MJO and S2S for subseasonal air pollution outlooks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163358,2,2,Yes,LGBM,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is based on the state-of-the-art Transformer neural network and various data embedding techniques.

TPPM25 is able to effectively capture temporal relations to multiple influencing meteorological features. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing with a cutting-edge ensemble deep learning model from Zhang et al. (Inf Sci 544:427–445, 2021). Our TPPM25 model outperforms Zhang et al.’s model under the same experimental setting on a well-researched benchmark dataset.

In this study, the air pollution levels of Sakarya, a major industrial city in Turkey, is analysed by calculating and modelling daily carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations. The CO values ​​are calculated using deep learning (Long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)) models. These models are benchmarked against machine learning (Artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), and support vector regression (SVR)) methods. The daily antecedent values ​​of observed CO and PM10 parameters were used as inputs.

Air quality measurements were initiated in different backgrounds including urban, suburban, industrial and rural to detect any significant changes in air quality parameters. Due to the dynamic nature of the weather, geographical location and anthropogenic sources, many uncertainties must be considered when dealing with air pollution data. In recent years, the Bayesian approach to fitting statistical models has gained more popularity due to its alternative modelling strategy that accounted for uncertainties for all air quality parameters. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the performance of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) in predicting the next-day PM10 concentration in Peninsular Malaysia. A case study utilized seventeen years’ worth of air quality monitoring data from nine (9) monitoring stations located in Peninsular Malaysia, using eight air quality parameters, i.e., PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. The performances of the next-day PM10 prediction were calculated using five models’ performance evaluators, namely Coefficient of Determination (R2), Index of Agreement (IA), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The BMA models indicate that relative humidity, wind speed and PM10 contributed the most to the prediction model for the majority of stations with (R2 = 0.752 at Pasir Gudang monitoring station), (R2 = 0.749 at Larkin monitoring station), (R2 = 0.703 at Kota Bharu monitoring station), (R2 = 0.696 at Kangar monitoring station) and (R2 = 0.692 at Jerantut monitoring station), respectively. Furthermore, the BMA models demonstrated a good prediction model performance, with IA ranging from 0.84 to 0.91, R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.75 and KGE ranging from 0.61 to 0.74 for all monitoring stations. According to the results of the investigation, BMA should be utilised in research and forecasting operations pertaining to environmental issues such as air pollution. From this study, BMA is recommended as one of the prediction tools for forecasting air pollution concentration, especially particulate matter level. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14020311,2,2,Yes,BMA,,,"Malaysia,Romania",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The values of the predictors at future moments are gathered from official weather forecast sites as independent ex-ante data. They are updated with new forecasted values every day. Each new sample is used to build- a separate single model that simultaneously predicts future pollution levels. The sought forecasts were estimated by averaging the actual predictions of the single models. The strategy was applied to three pollutants—PM10, SO2, and NO2—in the city of Pernik, Bulgaria. Random forest (RF) and arcing (Arc-x4) machine learning algorithms were applied to the modeling. Although there are many highly changing day-to-day predictors, the proposed averaging strategy shows a promising alternative to single models. In most cases, the root mean squared errors (RMSE) of the averaging models (aRF and aAR) for the last 10 horizons are lower than those of the single models. In particular, for PM10, the aRF’s RMSE is 13.1 vs. 13.8 micrograms per cubic meter for the single model; for the NO2 model, the aRF exhibits 21.5 vs. 23.8; for SO2, the aAR has 17.3 vs. 17.4; for NO2, the aAR’s RMSE is 22.7 vs. 27.5, respectively.

Methods for predicting the air quality grade and determining the necessary governance are at present most urgent problems waiting to be solved by human beings. In recent years, more and more machine-learning-based methods have been used to solve the air quality prediction problem. However, the uncertainty of environmental changes and the difficulty of precisely predicting quantitative values seriously influence prediction results. In this paper, the proposed air pollutant quality grade prediction method based on a hyperparameter-optimization-inspired long short-term memory (LSTM) network provides two advantages. Firstly, the definition of air quality grade is introduced in the air quality prediction task, which turns a fitting problem into a classification problem and makes the complex problem simple; secondly, the hunter–prey optimization algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the LSTM structure to obtain the optimal network structure adaptively determined through the use of input data, which can include more generalization abilities.

Recently, other statistical and machine-learning methods have also been applied to model air pollution, but their relative strengths and limitations have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we developed and compared land-use statistical and machine-learning models at annual, monthly and daily scales estimating ground-level NO2 concentrations across Switzerland (at high spatial resolution 100 × 100 m). Our study showed that the best model type varies with context, particularly with temporal resolution and training data size. Linear-regression-based models were useful in predicting long-term (annual, monthly) spatial distribution of NO2 and outperformed machine-learning models. However, linear-regression-based models were limited in representing short-term temporal variation even when predictor variables with temporal variability were provided. Machine-learning models showed high capability in predicting short-term temporal variation and outperformed linear-regression-based models for modeling NO2 variation at high temporal resolution (daily). However, the best performing models, XGBoost and LightGBM, constantly overfit on training data and may result in erratic patterns in the model-estimated concentration surfaces. Therefore, the temporal and spatial scale of the study is an important factor on which the choice of the suitable model type should be based and validation is required whatever approach is used. © 2022 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",Atmospheric Pollution Research,10.1016/j.apr.2022.101611,3,2,Yes,"LR,RF,XGB,LGBM,ANN",,Yes,Switzerland,,estimation,NO2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study conducted by the Swiss organization IQAir indicated that 22 of the top 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India. This creates the problem of air pollution, which is very relevant to India as well. Exposure to air pollutants has both acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) impacts on health. Among the major air pollutants, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is the most harmful, and its long-term exposure can impair lung functions. Pollutant concentrations vary temporally and are dependent on the local meteorology and emissions at a given geographic location. PM2.5 forecasting models have the potential to develop strategies for evaluating and alerting the public regarding expected hazardous levels of air pollution. Accurate measurement and forecasting of pollutant concentrations are critical for assessing air quality and making informed strategic decisions. Recently, data-driven machine learning algorithms for PM2.5 forecasting have received a lot of attention. In this work, a spatio-temporal analysis of air quality was first performed for Hyderabad, indicating that average PM2.5 concentrations during the winter were 68% higher than those during the summer. Following that, PM2.5 modelling was done using three different techniques: multilinear regression, K-nearest neighbours (KNN), and histogram-based gradient boost (HGBoost). Among these, the HGBoost regression model, which used both pollution and meteorological data as inputs, outperformed the other two techniques. During testing, the model acquired an amazing R2 value of 0.859, suggesting a significant connection with the actual data. Additionally, the model exhibited a minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.717 μg/m3 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.647 μg/m3, further confirming its accuracy in predicting PM2.5 concentrations. In our investigation, we discovered that the HGBoost3 model beat other PM2.5 modelling models by having the lowest error and the highest R2 value. This study made a substantial addition by incorporating the spatiotemporal relationship between air pollutants and meteorological variables in predicting air quality. This method has the potential to improve the creation of more precise air pollution forecast models. © 2023 The Author(s).

Air pollution forecasting is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying pollution in a specific region, but analyzing high-dimensional data with spatial and temporal dependencies poses a major challenge for traditional machine learning approaches. Additionally, missing sensor measurements due to malfunctions and connectivity loss have severely limited air pollution forecasting models' performance and restricted their use in production systems. Although significant efforts have been made in air pollution forecasting, many approaches face challenges in dealing with missing sensor data. Based on past and current research, this paper proposes and evaluates four encoder-decoder architectures with attention for forecasting particulate matter (PM) levels that are location- and season-independent. To handle missing sensor data, this paper also proposes and evaluates two adversarial networks for data augmentation. We conducted experiments to investigate the performance of predictive models with and without augmenting training datasets, and using the proposed adversarial models for data augmentation resulted in superior performance gains.

The results reveal that (i) compared with a convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep belief network (DBN), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF), the stacked machine learning model has a better ability to simulate the relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and influencing factors, with higher accuracy and a lower error rate. (ii) There was significant spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity of the PM2.5 concentration in Sichuan Province from October 2015 to September 2020, and the regional and clustering characteristics of air pollution are obvious, with PM2.5 concentrations mainly showing high-high clustering and low-low clustering. (iii) The key influencing factors of PM2.5 concentrations differ by month. Therefore, identifying the key influencing factors of PM2.5 concentrations in Sichuan Province in different months is crucial for the accurate management of air quality. (iv) The influence of interacting factors on PM2.5 concentrations varied by month. Therefore, the identification of key interaction factors influencing PM2.5 concentrations in Sichuan Province on a monthly time scale can provide some scientific evidence to support PM2.5 pollution prevention and control.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,10.1007/s41742-022-00494-7,2,2,Yes,"CNN,DBN,AB,XGB,RF",stacked,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The feature importance results show that cloud optical depth (COD), relative humidity, and precipitation are the top three factors affecting CTM high biases. Such results indicate that the high ozone biases in summer over China mainly occur on wet/cloudy days (similar to 40% biased high), while biases on dry/clear days are small (within 5%). We link the important features with model parameterizations and variables, identifying model underestimates in the dry deposition velocity and COD on wet/cloudy days. By accounting for the enhanced dry deposition on wet plant cuticles and using satellite observation constrained COD, we find that CTM high ozone biases can be halved with an improved agreement in the temporal variability, highlighting the effects of dry deposition and COD on ozone, as suggested by the RF outcomes.",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,10.1021/acs.est.2c05712,4,2,Yes,RF,,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the impact of the lockdown due to COVID-19 on multiple cities, this study utilized data from 18 cities of Henan to understand the air quality pattern change during COVID-19 from 2019 to 2021. It examined the temporal and spatial distribution impact. This study firstly utilized a deep learning bi-directional long-term short-term (Bi-LSTM) model to predict air quality patterns during 3 periods, i.e., COVID-A (before COVID-19, i.e., 2019), COVID-B (during COVID-19, i.e., 2020), COVID-C (after COVID-19 cases, i.e., 2021) and obtained the R-2 value of more than 72% average in each year and decreased MAE value, which was better than other studies' deep learning methods. This study secondly focused on the change of pollutants and observed an increase in Air Quality Index by 10%, a decrease in PM2.5 by 14%, PM10 by 18%, NO2 by 14%, and SO2 by 16% during the COVID-B period. This study found an increase in O-3 by 31% during the COVID-C period and observed a significant decrease in pollutants during the COVID-C period (PM10 by 42%, PM2.5 by 97%, NO2 by 89%, SO2 by 36%, CO by 58%, O-3 by 31%). Lastly, the impact of lockdown policies was studied during the COVID-B period and the results showed that Henan achieved the Grade I standards of air quality standards after lockdown was implemented. Although there were many severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on human health and the global economy, lockdowns likely resulted in significant short-term health advantages owing to reduced air pollution and significantly improved ambient air quality.

Over the past decades, the frequency and intensity of wildfires has increased in many areas, resulting in longer smoke episodes with higher concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). There are also many communities where seasonal open burning and residential wood heating have short- and long-term impacts on ambient air quality. Understanding the acute and chronic health effects of biomass smoke exposure requires reliable estimates of PM2.5 concentrations during the wildfire season and throughout the year, particularly in areas without regulatory air quality monitoring stations. We have developed a machine learning approach to estimate PM2.5 across all populated regions of Canada from 2010 to 2019. The random forest machine learning model uses potential predictor variables integrated from multiple data sources and estimates daily mean (24-hour) PM2.5 concentrations at a 5 km Ã 5 km spatial resolution. The training and prediction datasets were generated using observations from National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between predicted and observed PM2.5 concentrations was 2.96 ?g/m3 for the entire prediction set, and more than 96 % of the predictions were within 5 ?g/m3 of the NAPS PM2.5 measurements. The model was evaluated using 10-fold, leave one-region-out, and leave-one-year-out cross-validations. Overall, CanOSSEM performed well but performance was sensitive to removal of large wildfire events such as the Fort McMurray interface fire in May 2016 or the extreme 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons in British Columbia. Exposure estimates from CanOSSEM will be useful for epidemiologic studies on the acute and chronic health effects associated with PM2.5 exposure, especially for populations affected by biomass smoke where routine air quality measurements are not available.

Thus, ozone forecasting is a critical task that can help people avoid dangerously high ozone concentrations. Conventional numerical approaches, as well as data-driven forecasting approaches, have been studied for ozone forecasting. Data-driven forecasting models, in particular, have gained momentum with the introduction of machine learning advancements. We consider planetary boundary layer (PBL) height as a new input feature for data-driven ozone forecasting models. PBL has been shown to impact ozone concentrations, making it an important factor in ozone forecasts. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of utilization of PBL height on the performance of surface ozone forecasts. We present both surface ozone forecasting models, based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) and bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models. These two models forecast hourly ozone concentrations for an upcoming 24-h period using two types of input data, such as measurement data and PBL height. We consider the predicted values of PBL height obtained from the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, since it is difficult to gather actual PBL measurements. We evaluate two ozone forecasting models in terms of index of agreement (IOA), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). Results showed that the MLP-based and bidirectional LSTM-based models yielded lower MAE and RMSE when considering forecasted PBL height, but there was no significant changes in IOA when compared with models in which no forecasted PBL data were used. This result suggests that utilizing forecasted PBL height can improve the forecasting performance of data-driven prediction models for surface ozone concentrations.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/s22207864,2,1,Yes,"LSTM,MLP",,No,"South Korea,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three main results substantiate the importance of this research. First, the classification analysis corroborates the idea of a neutrality principle of road traffic on the target since the respective coefficient is significant, but quantitatively close to zero. This result, which may be the first sign of a paradigm shift regarding the adoption of electric vehicles in addition to reflect the success of previously implemented measures in the city of Lisbon, is reinforced by evidence that the carbon monoxide emitted mostly by diesel vehicles exhibits a significant, negative and permanent effect on satisfying the hourly limit value associated with the target. Second, robustness checks confirm that the period between 8 h and 16 h is particularly remarkable for influencing the target. Finally, the predictive exercise demonstrates that the internationally patented Variable Split Convolutional Attention model has the best predictive performance among several deep learning neural network alternatives. Results indicate that the concentration of nitrogen dioxide is expected to be volatile and only a redundant downward trend is likely to be observed. Therefore, in terms of policy recommendations, additional measures to avoid exceeding the legal nitrogen dioxide ceiling at the local level should be focused on reducing carbon monoxide emissions, rather than just being concerned about halting the intensity of road traffic.

In 2017, 77% of population of India were subjected to Particulate Matter (PM2.5) exposure, resulting in mortality of 6.7 lakh throughout the country. In this study, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a powerful deep learning technique, is applied for PM2.5 prediction. Three variants of LSTM model, LSTM for regression, LSTM for regression using window, and LSTM for regression with time steps, are developed to predict PM2.5 concentration in India. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the predictive models are root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The models are applied to continuous ambient air quality data collected from 14 stations in India, for the period from May 01, 2019, to April 30, 2020, at an interval of every 15 minutes. The optimal results are obtained from the models with the tuned parameters of 64 epochs and batch size of 32. All the three variants of LSTM model performed equally well in predicting PM2.5 concentration. The experimental results revealed that the value of R2 is maintained at 0.9 consistently for all the variants of LSTM model. The low values of RMSE and high values of R2 proved the reliability of the model. Thus, the proposed model gives awareness about the air pollution level in India and alerts the society to take precautionary steps to save their lives. Further, the urban planners can have an idea of the pollution levels for their planning and decision making. Â© 2022 University of Kuwait.

Consequently, comprehensive research is being conducted to provide solutions to air quality management. Recently, it has been demonstrated that environmental parameters, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and vegetation, interact with air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), NO2, SO2, O3, and CO, contributing to frameworks for forecasting air quality. The objective of the present study is to explore these interactions in three Iranian metropolises of Tehran, Tabriz, and Shiraz from 2015 to 2019 and develop a machine learning-based model to predict daily air pollution. Three distinct assessment criteria were used to assess the proposed XGBoost model, including R squared (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Preliminary results showed that although air pollutants were significantly associated with meteorological factors and vegetation, the formulated model had low accuracy in predicting (R2PM2.5 = 0.36, R2PM10 = 0.27, R2NO2 = 0.46, R2SO2 = 0.41, R2O3 = 0.52, and R2CO = 0.38). Accordingly, future studies should consider more variables, including emission data from manufactories and traffic, as well as sunlight and wind direction. It is also suggested that strategies be applied to minimize the lack of observational data by considering second-and third-order interactions between parameters, increasing the number of simultaneous air pollution and meteorological monitoring stations, as well as hybrid machine learning models based on proximal and satellite data.

The accurate prediction of pollutant concentrations remains a challenging issue owing to the inherent complexity and volatility of pollutant series. In this study, a novel hybrid forecasting method for hourly pollutant concentration prediction that comprises a mode decomposition-recombination technique and a deep learning approach was designed. First, a Hampel filter was used to remove outliers from the original data. Subsequently, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is employed to divide the original pollution data into a finite set of intrinsic mode function (IMF) components. Further, a feature extraction method based on sample-fuzzy entropy and K-means is proposed to reconstruct the main features of IMFs. In conclusion, a deterministic forecasting model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) was established for pollutant prediction. The empirical results of six-hourly pollutant concentrations from Baoding illustrate that the proposed decomposition-recombination technique can effectively handle nonlinear and highly volatile pollution data. The developed hybrid model is significantly better than other comparative models, which is promising for early air quality warning systems.

Recently, more and more machine-learning-based methods are being used to solve the air-quality-prediction problem, and gated recurrent units (GRUs) are a representative method because of their advantage for processing time-series data. However, in the same air-quality-prediction task, different researchers have always designed different structures of the GRU due to their different experiences. Data-adaptively designing a GRU structure has thus become a problem. In this paper, we propose an adaptive GRU to address this problem, and the adaptive GRU structures are determined by the dataset, which mainly contributes with three steps. Firstly, an encoding method for the GRU structure is proposed for representing the network structure in a fixed-length binary string; secondly, we define the reciprocal of the sum of the loss of each individual as the fitness function for the iteration computation; thirdly, the genetic algorithm is used for computing the data-adaptive GRU network structure, which can enhance the air-quality-prediction result. The experiment results from three real datasets in XiÂan show that the proposed method achieves better effectiveness in RMSE and SAMPE than the existing LSTM-, SVM-, and RNN-based methods.

Long-term exposure to constituents of air pollutants has exerted serious health implications in both humans and plants leading to a detrimental impact on economy. Among the pollutants contributing to air quality determination, particulate matter has been linked to serious health implications causing pulmonary complications, cardiovascular diseases, growth retardation and ultimately death. In agriculture, crop yield is also negatively impacted by the deposition of particulate matter on stomata of the plant which is alarming and can cause food security concerns. The deleterious impact of air pollutants on human health, agricultural and economic well-being highlights the importance of quantifying and forecasting particulate matter. Several deterministic and deep learning models have been employed in the recent years to forecast the concentration of particulate matter. Among them, deep learning models have shown promising results when it comes to modeling time series data and forecasting it. We have explored recurrent neural networks with LSTM model which shows potential to predict the particulate matter (PM2.5) based on multi-step multi-variate data of two of the most polluted regions of South Asia, Beijing, China and Punjab, Pakistan effectively. The LSTM model is tuned using Bayesian optimization technique to employ the appropriate hyper-parameters and weight initialization strategies based on the dataset. The model was able to predict PM2.5 for the next hour with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.1913 (91.5% accuracy) and this error gradually increases with the number of time steps with next 24 hours steps prediction having RMSE of 0.7290. While in case of Punjab dataset with data recorded once a day, the RMSE for the next day forecast is 0.2192. These multi-step short-term forecasts would play a pivotal role in establishing an early warning system based on the air quality index (AQI) calculated and enable the government in enacting policies to contain it.

Precise prediction of air quality parameters can assist in the effective action of air pollution control and prevention. In this work, a deep learning framework is proposed to predict parameters such as fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based model that processes sequences in forward and backward direction to consider the influence of timesteps in both directions is employed. For further learning, unidirectional layers' stacking is implemented. The performance of the model is optimized by fine-tuning hyperparameters, regularization techniques for overfitting resolution, and various merging options for the bidirectional input layer. The proposed model achieves good optimization and performs better than the simple LSTM and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based model. Moreover, an attention-based mechanism is adopted to focus on more significant timesteps for prediction. The self-attention approach improves performance further and works well especially for longer sequences and extended time horizons. Experiments are conducted using real-world data collected, and results are evaluated using the mean square error loss function.

Air pollution has become a critical environmental issue in recent decades. Forecasts of air quality play an important role in warning people about and controlling air pollution. Considerable research has been devoted to predicting instances of poor air quality, but most studies are limited by insufficient longitudinal data, making it difficult to account for seasonal and other factors. Several prediction models have been developed using an 8-year dataset collected by Beijing Environmental Protection Monitoring Center (BEPMC). The small spatial and temporal scales and nonlinearity of climate effects are significant challenges to precise Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. As a result, data normalization is applied to enhance air quality features without distorting divergences. Machine learning methods, including simple linear regression (SLR), support vector regressor (SVR), random forest (RF), and probabilistic voting ensemble, were used to build regression models for predicting the AQI of six central and outskirt regions of Beijing city. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the regression models. Experimental results showed that the max probabilistic voting ensemble performed better in the prediction of the AQI in terms of R2, whereas RF performed better in the prediction of the AQI in terms of MAE and RMSE scores. The overall performance of the proposed model in terms of MAE and RMSE is between 0.0128 to 0.0194 and 0.0230 to 0.0326, respectively. This work also illustrates that combining ensemble learning consisting of various classifiersÂ output weights with air quality prediction is an efficient and convenient way to solve certain significant environmental problems.

Air pollution is a significant issue confronted by the environment particularly by highly populated countries like India. Due to increased population, the number of vehicles also continues to increase. Each vehicle has its individual emission rate; however, the issue arises when the emission rate crosses the standard value and the quality of the air gets degraded. Owing to the technological advances in machine learning (ML), it is possible to develop prediction approaches to monitor and control pollution using real time data. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics (BDA), there is a huge paradigm shift in how environmental data are employed for sustainable cities and societies, especially by applying intelligent algorithms. In this view, this study develops an optimal AI based air quality prediction and classification (OAI-AQPC) model in big data environment. For handling big data from environmental monitoring, Hadoop MapReduce tool is employed. In addition, a predictive model is built using the hybridization of ARIMA and neural network (NN) called ARIMA-NN to predict the pollution level. For improving the performance of the ARIMA-NN algorithm, the parameter tuning process takes place using oppositional swallow swarm optimization (OSSO) algorithm. Finally, Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) classifier is used to classify the air quality into pollutant and non-pollutant. A detailed experimental analysis is performed for highlighting the better prediction performance of the proposed ARIMA-NN method.

Our results indicated that when the meteorological variables were obtained from the same pollution station the results were better. We were also able to reduce the time by reducing the set of variables required for prediction from 11 down to 3 and achieved major time improvement by about 80% for NO2, 92% for SO2, and 90% for PM10.

The performance evaluation results indicated that the new model is reliable with a sample (station)-based 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) R2 value of 0.94 (0.90) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.58 (19.18) Âµg m?3. In addition, the estimated O3 concentration is accurately determined at varying temporal scales with sample-based 10-CV R2 values of 0.96, 0.98 and 0.98 at the daily, monthly, and seasonal scales, respectively, which is highly superior to traditional derivation algorithms and other techniques in previous studies. An initial increase and subsequent decrease, which constitute the diurnal variation in the O3 concentration associated with temperature and solar radiation variations, were captured. The highest concentration reached approximately 112.73 Â± 9.65 ?g m?3 at 15:00 local time (1500 LT) in the BTH region. Summertime O3 posed a high pollution risk across the whole BTH region, especially in southern cities, and the pollution duration accounted for more than 50% of the summer season. Additionally, 43 and two days exhibited light and moderate O3 pollution, respectively, across the BTH region in 2018. Overall, the new method can be beneficial for near-surface O3 estimation with a high spatiotemporal resolution, which can be valuable for research in related fields.

However, despite their success, most of the current data-driven solutions lack proper quantifications of model uncertainty that communicate how much to trust the forecasts. Recently, several practical tools to estimate uncertainty have been developed in probabilistic deep learning. However, there have not been empirical applications and extensive comparisons of these tools in the domain of air quality forecasts. Therefore, this work applies state-of-the-art techniques of uncertainty quantification in a real-world setting of air quality forecasts. Through extensive experiments, we describe training probabilistic models and evaluate their predictive uncertainties based on empirical performance, reliability of confidence estimate, and practical applicability. We also propose improving these models using ÂfreeÂ adversarial training and exploiting temporal and spatial correlation inherent in air quality data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed models perform better than previous works in quantifying uncertainty in data-driven air quality forecasts. Overall, Bayesian neural networks provide a more reliable uncertainty estimate but can be challenging to implement and scale. Other scalable methods, such as deep ensemble, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and stochastic weight averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), can perform well if applied correctly but with different tradeoffs and slight variations in performance metrics. Finally, our results show the practical impact of uncertainty estimation and demonstrate that, indeed, probabilistic models are more suitable for making informed decisions. Â© 2021 by the authors.

When analyzing air data, it is found that this type of data has not only temporal correlation, but also spatial correlation. For these temporal and spatial characteristics, this paper studies deep spatio-temporal learning method to global prediction. The purpose is to learn the evolution rule behind the spatio-temporal sequence, and give an estimation for future state. To be specific, we propose two novel forecasting models based on video processing technology: Spatio-temporal Orthogonal Cube model (STOR-cube) and Spatio-temporal Dynamic Advection model (ST-DA), which effectively capture the spatio-temporal correlation and accurately predict the long-term air quality. STOR-cube contains three branches, i.e., a spatial branch for capturing moving objects, a temporal branch for processing motion, and an output branch for coupling the first two mutually orthogonal branches to generate a prediction frame. ST-DA constructs a spatio-temporal reasoning network to learn the characteristics of the spatio-temporal domain, and its impact on the future is explicitly modeled by pixel motion. Experiments results on the real-world datasets demonstrate our proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.

Most of the existing PM2.5 concentration forecast methods lack the ability to model the dynamic temporal and spatial correlations of PM2.5 concentration. In an industrial park environment, in order to improve the accuracy of PM2.5 concentration forecast, based on deep learning technology, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph convolutional network based on the attention mechanism (STAM-STGCN) to solve the PM2.5 concentration forecast problem. When constructing the adjacency matrix, we not only use the Euclidean distance between sites but also consider the impact of wind fields and the impact of pollution sources near the nodes. In the process of model construction, we first use the spatiotemporal attention mechanism to capture the dynamic spatiotemporal correlations in PM2.5 data. In the spatiotemporal convolution module, we use graph convolutional neural networks to capture spatial features and standard convolution to describe temporal features. Finally, the output module adjusts the output shape of the data to produce the final forecast result. In this paper, the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as the performance evaluation metrics of the model, and the Dongmingnan Industrial Park atmospheric dataset is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that our STAM-STGCN model can more fully capture the spatial-temporal characteristics of PM2.5 concentration data; compared with the most advanced model in the comparison model, the RMSE can be improved about 24.2%, the MAE is improved about 35.8%, and the MAPE is improved about 34.6%.",WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING,10.1155/2021/7000986,2,1,Yes,"GCN,GRU,LSTM",,Yes,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in previous studies, new prediction algorithms have only been tested at stations or in a small region; a large-scale air quality forecasting model remains lacking to date. Huge dimensionality also means that redundant input data may lead to increased complexity and therefore the over-fitting of machine learning models. Feature selection is a key topic in machine learning development, but it has not yet been explored in atmosphere-related applications. In this work, a regional feature selection-based machine learning (RFSML) system was developed, which is capable of predicting air quality in the short term with high accuracy at the national scale. Ensemble-Shapley additive global importance analysis is combined with the RFSML system to extract significant regional features and eliminate redundant variables at an affordable computational expense. The significance of the regional features is also explained physically. Compared with a standard machine learning system fed with relative features, the RFSML system driven by the selected key features results in superior interpretability, less training time, and more accurate predictions.

The particulate matter (PM2.5) plays a key role in evaluating the air quality index. However, the conventional PM2.5 monitoring instruments used by the air quality monitoring stations are costly, bulkier, time-consuming, and power-hungry. Furthermore, due to limited data availability and non-scalability, it is challenging to provide high spatial and temporal resolution in real-time. To overcome these challenges, we present analytical equations based prediction approach for PM2.5 using an artificial neural network. Moreover, we contribute the correlation study between PM2.5 and other pollutants using a large authenticate data set of Central Pollution Control Board online station, India. The correlation study reveals the strong correlation of eight pollutants with PM2.5, which found useful for the proposed prediction model and future research work. The computation of the proposed analytical equation using a low-cost processing tool (excel sheet) demonstrates a good match between predicted and actual results. Additionally, the derived analytical equation for the prediction can be computed using a wireless sensor node which ultimately eliminates the need for costly propriety tools. The performance of proposed analytical equation for prediction show root mean square error and coefficient of determination (R2) 1.80Â ? g/m3 and 0.99 respectively using eight correlated predictors. The recalibrated prediction model with three correlated predictors show RMSE of 7.54Â ? g/m3 and R2 of 0.97 and proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach in implementation using minimum power-hungry gas sensors on the WSN. Therefore, obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach is one of the promising approaches for monitoring PM2.5 without power-hungry gas sensors and bulkier analyzers.

While previous studies intensively evaluated air pollution episodes and extreme heat events, a limited number of studies comprehensively assessed atmospheric hot-and-polluted-episodes (HPE) - an episode with simultaneously high levels of air pollution and temperature - which have potential adverse synergic impacts on human health. This study focused on the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China due to its high temperature in summer and poor air quality throughout a year. We employed geostatistical downscaling to model meteorology at a spatial resolution of 1 km, and applied a machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) to estimate a high-resolution (1 km) daily concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) for June to October over 20 years (2000-2019). Our results indicate an increasing trend (similar to 50%) in the frequency of HPE occurrence in the first decade (2000-2010). Conversely, the annual frequency of HPE occurrence reduced (16.7%), but its intensity increased during the second decade (2010-2019). The northern cities in the PRD region had higher levels of PM2.5 and O-3 than their southern counterparts. During HPEs, regional daily PM2.5 exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese guideline levels by 75% and 25%, respectively, while the O-3 exceeded the WHO O-3 standard by up to 69%.

The other part is a station wise feature extraction unit to extract station-wise meteorological feature impact on PM2.5 concentration, along with the temporal dependency between historical records. The results from the two units are fused in step-wise manner for multi-step PM2.5 forecasting.

It not only directly affects the environment and human health, but also influences the regional and even global climate by changing the atmospheric radiation budget, resulting in extensive and serious adverse effects. It is of great significance to accurately predict the concentration of pollutant. In this study, the domain knowledge of Atmospheric Sciences, advanced deep learning methods and big data are skillfully combined to establish a novel integrated model TSTM, derived from its fundamental features of Time, Space, Type and Meteorology, to achieve regional and multistep air quality forecast. Firstly, Expectation Maximization and Min-Max algorithms are used for the interpolation and normalization of data. Secondly, feature selection and construction are accomplished based on domain knowledge and correlation coefficient, and then Sliding Time Window algorithm is employed to build the supervised learning task. Thirdly, the features of pollution source and meteorological condition are learned and predicted by CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, the integrated model of convolutional neural network and Bidirectional long short-term memory network based on Sequence to Sequence framework with Attention mechanism, and then Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (ConvLSTM) integrates the two determinant features to obtain predicted pollutant concentration.

In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of predictive models for fine particulate matter in Daejeon, the fifth largest city in South Korea. This study is conducted for three purposes. The first purpose is to determine the factors that may cause air pollution. Two main factors are considered: meteorological and traffic. The second purpose is to find an optimal predictive model for air pollutant concentration. We apply machine learning and deep learning models to the collected dataset to predict hourly air pollutant concentrations. The accuracy of the deep learning models is better than that of the machine learning models. The third purpose is to analyze the influence of road conditions on predicting air pollutant concentration. Experimental results demonstrate that considering wind direction and wind speed could significantly decrease the error rate of the predictive models.",ATMOSPHERE,10.3390/atmos12101295,2,1,Yes,"GBDT,RF,LGBM,GRU,LSTM",,No,South Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the detrended fluctuation analysis and power-law analysis are used in an analysis of the statistical characteristics of air pollution and weather data. Rigorous seasonality adjustment of the air pollution and weather data was performed because of their complex seasonality patterns and the heavy-tailed distribution of data even after deseasonalization.

Thus, air pollution forecasting would be beneficial and would guide citizens in avoiding exposure to dangerous emissions. The air health of a place can be diagnosed by close observation of the AQI (Air Quality Index) of that place. Moreover, the AQI of a place may have some influence on the pollutant concentration of the neighboring places. To address this issue, this work introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that is able to predict the values of a corresponding metric: AQI of smart cities. As a part of this work, two algorithms are proposed. The first one replaces the missing values in the dataset and the second one formulates the influence of the nearby placesÂ pollutant concentrations on the air quality of a particular place. A deep learning-based forecasting model is also proposed by combining 1D-CNN and Bi-GRU. To test the applicability of the framework, a large-scale experiment is carried out with the real-world dataset collected from New South Wales, Australia. Experimental results validate that the proposed framework provides a stable forecasting result, it confirms that the AQI of a place gets affected by the pollutant concentration of the nearby places and the comparison of forecasting result with the existing state of the art models shows that the proposed model outperforms the other models.

The modeling and reliable prediction of air quality remain substantial challenges because uncertainties residing in emissions data are unknown and the dynamic processes are not well understood. A number of machine learning approaches have been used to predict air quality to help alleviate air pollution, since accurate air quality estimation may result in significant social-economic development. From this perspective, a novel air quality estimation approach is proposed, which consists of two components: newly-designed dendritic neural regression (DNR) and customized scale-free network-based differential evolution (SFDE). The DNR can adaptively utilize spatio-temporal information to capture the nonlinear correlation between observations and air pollutant concentrations. Since the landscape of the weight space in DNR is vast and multimodal, SFDE is used as the optimization algorithm due to its powerful search ability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide stable and reliable performances in the estimation of both PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, being significantly better than several commonly-used machine learning algorithms, such as support vector regression and long short-term memory.

Therefore, multiple systems have been developed for early prediction of air pollution levels in large cities. However, deterministic models produce uncertainties due to the complexity of the physical and chemical processes of individual systems and transport. In turn, statistical and machine learning techniques require a large amount of historical data to predict the behavior of a variable. In this paper, we propose a data fusion model to spatially and temporally predict air quality and assess its situation and risk for public health. Our model is based on the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) model and focused on Information Quality (IQ), which allows us to fine tune hyper-parameters in different processes and trace information from raw data to knowledge. Expert systems use the information assessment to select and process data, information, and knowledge. The functionality of our model is tested using an environmental database of the Air Quality Monitoring Network of Ãrea Metropolitana del Valle de AburrÃ¡ (AMVA in Spanish) in Colombia. Different levels of noise are added to the data to analyze the effects of information quality on the systems' performance throughout the process. Finally, our system is compared with two conventional machine learning-based models: Deep Learning and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The results show that our proposed model exhibits better performance, in terms of air quality forecasting, than conventional models. Furthermore, its capability as a mechanism to support decision making is clearly demonstrated.

At present, traditional methods, such as deterministic and statistical approaches, have large prediction errors and cannot provide effective information to prevent the negative effects of air pollution. Therefore, few existing methods could obtain accurate air pollutant time series predictions. To this end, a deep learning-based air pollutant prediction method, namely, the autocorrelation error-Informer (AE-Informer) model, is proposed in this study. The model implements the AE based on the Informer model. The AE-Informer model is used to predict the hourly concentrations of multiple air pollutants, including PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and O3. The experimental results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values of AE-Informer in multivariate prediction are 3% less than those of the Informer model; thus, the prediction error is effectively reduced. In addition, a stacking ensemble model is proposed to supplement the missing air pollutant time series data.

Therefore, mathematical models that do not relate the source to the air quality do not offer guidance on how to regulate the air quality. This is often due to a lack of information about sources or a limited budget to measure emissions from sources that are expected to have a major contribution. A proxy for emission rate was used in modeling to improve the prediction of pollutant concentration and to investigate major sources. The daily average air concentration of NO2 and SO2 were predicted at five different locations using supervised machine learning methods, including random forests and support vector machines regression. Three models were constructed using different combinations of features. In model I, only features relating to the weather were used. Model II used only features of the types and quantities of fossil fuels consumed by power plants, which serve as a proxy for emission rates. In model III, all features from models I and II were used. Model III was found to be the most accurate. The average improvement in R2 for NO2 and SO2 regressions for all sites and using both methods were between 61% and 33%, respectively. This improvement in the prediction indicates that power plants are major sources and contribute significantly to the ambient level of SO2 and NO2 levels. The relative importance of all fuel consumption features was found to be comparable to the value of all weather features. The relative importance values of the fuel consumption features show an opportunity to improve air quality by burning a quantity of fuel in a power plant that has a smaller relative importance value instead. However, whether the receptors are located in rural or urban areas must be considered to maximize the net benefits. © 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Kuwait University.

Accurate prediction of PM2.5 (a category of particulate pollutant with a diameter of less than 2.5μm) has been a critical topic, as it can provide valuable information for government decision-making and policy control in environmental management affairs. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the next 48hr PM2.5 concentration in Taiwan. In this model, monitoring stations are regarded as nodes and edges are the distances between monitoring stations. Hence, the distribution of the stations can be perceived as a graph. GNNs are promising in processing non-grid structure data that can be represented as a graph. By incorporating the GNN and gated recurrent units (GRUs), this model can effectively capture the long-term spatial–temporal features in air quality time-series data. In addition, we also investigated the problem of predicting PM2.5 concentrations in the areas without monitoring stations or at sites far away from the stations. This problem has not captured researchers’ attention whose methods are based on GNN. The problem is, however, quite challenging as these areas do not have historical air quality data, leading to low prediction quality. Finally, we performed experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model based on actual data sources obtained in Taiwan.

Due to rapid expansion in commercial social, and economic aspects, the pollutant concentrations in different parts of the world continue to increase and disrupt human life. Thus, monitoring the pollutant levels is of primary importance to keep the pollutant concentrations under control. Regular monitoring enables the authorities to take appropriate measures in case of high pollution. However, monitoring the pollutant concentrations is not straightforward as it requires installing monitoring stations to collect the relevant pollutant data, which comes with high installation and maintenance costs. In this research, an attempt has been made to simulate the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 at two sites in Stuttgart (Marienplatz and Am Neckartor) using Machine Learning methods. These pollutants are measured with the help of monitoring stations at these locations. Five Machine Learning methods, namely ridge regressor, support vector regressor, random forest, extra trees regressor, and xtreme gradient boosting, were adopted for this study. Meteorological parameters, traffic data, and pollutant information from nearby monitoring stations for the period from January 01, 2018 to 31.03.2022 were considered as inputs to model the pollutants. From the results, it was concluded that the pollutant information from the nearby stations has a significant effect in predicting the pollutant concentrations. Further, it was investigated if a similar methodology can be applied at other locations to estimate pollutant concentrations. This procedure was tested on the data of the monitoring station Karlsruhe-Nordwest which is located in another German city named Karlsruhe. The results demonstrated that this method is applicable in other areas as well. © 2023 The Authors",Atmospheric Environment,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119987,1,1,Yes,"RR,SVR,RF,ERT,GBELM",,Yes,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Air quality, however, is difficult to predict due to the complex dynamics, and its accurate forecast still remains a challenge. This study suggests a spatiotemporal Informer model, which uses a new spatiotemporal embedding and spatiotemporal attention, to improve AQI forecast accuracy. In the first phase of the proposed forecast mechanism, the input data is transformed by the spatiotemporal embedding. Next, the spatiotemporal attention is applied to extract spatiotemporal features from the embedded data. The final forecast is obtained based on the attention tensors. In the proposed forecast model, the input is a 3-dimensional data that consists of air quality data (AQI, PM2.5, O3, SO2, NO2, CO) and geographic information, and the output is a multi-positional, multi-temporal data that shows the AQI forecast result of all the monitoring stations in the study area. The proposed forecast model was evaluated by air quality data of 34 monitoring stations in Beijing, China. Experiments showed that the proposed forecast model could provide highly accurate AQI forecast: the average of MAPE values for from 1 h to 20 h ahead forecast was 11.61%, and it was much smaller than other models. Moreover, the proposed model provided a highly accurate and stable forecast even at the extreme points.

The air quality index is a figure, based on the cumulative effect of major air pollutant concentrations, used by Government agencies, for air quality assessment. Thus, the main aim of the present study is to predict the daily AQI one year in advance through three different neural network models (FF-NN, CF-NN and LR-NN) for the year 2020 and compare them. The models were trained using AQI values of previous year (2019). In addition to main air pollutants like PM10/PM2.5, O3, SO2, NOx, CO and NH3, the non-criteria pollutants and meteorological data were also included as input parameter in this study. The model performances were assessed using statistical analysis. The key air pollutants contributing to high level of daily AQI were found to be PM2.5/PM10, CO and NO2. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of 31.86 and 28.03 were obtained for the FF-NN and CF-NN models respectively whereas the LR-NN model has the minimum RMSE value of 26.79. LR-NN algorithm predicted the AQI values very closely to the actual values in almost all the seasons of the year. The LR-NN performance was also found to be the best in post-monsoon season i.e., October and November (maximum R2 = 0.94) with respect to other seasons. The study would aid air pollution control authorities to predict AQI more precisely and adopt suitable pollution control measures. Further research studies are recommended to compare the performance of LR-NN model with statistical, numerical and computational models for accurate air quality assessment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,10.1007/s10661-023-11646-3,1,1,Yes,ANN,,,"India,Saudi Arabia",prediction,AQI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many deep learning and mode decomposition techniques have been explored to capture the temporal and nonlinear features of PM2.5 concentration data. However, most of the existing methods ignore the differences in prediction losses of individual subsequences, resulting in lower prediction accuracy. To address this limitation, we proposed an ensemble gated recurrent unit (GRU) model that incorporated a self-weighted total loss function based on variational mode decomposition (VMD). In this approach, the PM2.5 concentration series were decomposed using the VMD, and then each decomposed subsequence (including the residual sequence) was fed into the GRU and the predicted loss of the subsequence was then calculated. For the model to output optimal predictions, we used a self-weighted ensemble loss function to adaptively optimize the prediction loss for each subsequence. Specifically, larger weights were assigned to the model's subsequences with higher predictive losses to better focus on those with higher predictive losses. In addition, the hyperparameter of the model was adjusted to adapt to various datasets in different domains. Experimental results on the three datasets show that our model performs better than the VMD-GRU and single GRU models. This validates the effectiveness of our model. Our approach has the advantage of plug-and-play, making it easier to seamlessly integrate deep learning techniques and pattern decomposition methods into air quality prediction. © 2023",Ecological Indicators,10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111138,1,1,Yes,GRU,ENS,,China,forecast,PM25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, aerosol optical depth (AOD) offers high resolution and wide coverage, making it a viable way to estimate PM concentrations. Recent years have also witnessed in-creasing promise in refining air quality predictions via deep neural network (DNN) models, out-performing other techniques. However, learning the weights and biases of the DNN is a task classified as an NP-hard problem. Current approaches such as gradient-based methods exhibit significant limitations, such as the risk of becoming ensnared in local minimal within multi-objective loss functions, substantial computational requirements, and the requirement for continuous objective functions. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines the binary gray wolf optimizer (BGWO) with DNN to improve the optimization of models for air pollution prediction. The BGWO algorithm, inspired by the behavior of gray wolves, is used to optimize both the weight and bias of the DNN. In the proposed BGWO, a novel sigmoid function is proposed as a transfer function to adjust the position of the wolves. This study gathers meteorological data, topographic information, PM10 pollution data, and satellite images. Data preparation includes tasks such as noise removal and handling missing data. The proposed approach is evaluated through cross-validation using metrics such as correlation rate, R square, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and accuracy. The effectiveness of the BGWO-DNN framework is compared to seven other machine learning (ML) models. The experimental evaluation of the BGWO-DNN method using air pollution data shows its superior performance compared with traditional ML techniques. The BGWO-DNN, CapSA-DNN, and BBO-DNN models achieved the lowest RMSE values of 16.28, 19.26, and 20.74, respectively. Conversely, the SVM-Linear and GBM algorithms displayed the highest levels of error, yielding RMSE values of 36.82 and 32.50, respectively. The BGWO-DNN algorithm secured the highest R2 (88.21%) and accuracy (93.17%) values, signifying its superior performance compared with other models. Additionally, the correlation between predicted and actual values shows that the proposed model surpasses the performance of other ML techniques.

However, due to the mobility and dynamics of pollution sources, meteorological conditions, and transformation processes, pollutant concentration predictions are characterized by great uncertainty and instability, making it difficult for existing prediction models to effectively extract spatial and temporal correlations. In this paper, a powerful pollutant prediction model (STA-ResConvLSTM) is proposed to achieve accurate prediction of pollutant concentrations. The model consists of a deep learning network model based on a residual neural network (ResNet), a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, and a convolutional long short-term memory neural network (ConvLSTM). The spatial-temporal attention mechanism is embedded in each residual unit of the ResNet to form a new residual neural network with the spatial-temporal attention mechanism (STA-ResNet). Deep extraction of spatial-temporal distribution features of pollutant concentrations and meteorological data from several cities is carried out using STA-ResNet. Its output is used as an input to the ConvLSTM, which is further analyzed to extract preliminary spatial-temporal distribution features extracted from the STA-ResNet. The model realizes the spatial-temporal correlation of the extracted feature sequences to accurately predict pollutant concentrations in the future. In addition, experimental studies on urban agglomerations around Long Beijing show that the prediction model outperforms various popular baseline models in terms of accuracy and stability. For the single-step prediction task, the proposed pollutant concentration prediction model performs well, exhibiting a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 9.82.

To address this issue, we introduce an innovative deep-learning-based multi-graph model using Beijing as the study case. This model consists of two key modules: firstly, the 'Meteorological Factor Spatio-Temporal Feature Extraction Module'. This module deeply integrates spatio-temporal features of hourly meteorological data by employing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for spatial and temporal encoding respectively. Subsequently, through an attention mechanism, it retrieves a feature tensor associated with air pollutants. Secondly, these features are amalgamated with PM2.5 concentration values, allowing the 'PM2.5 Concentration Prediction Module' to predict with enhanced accuracy the joint influence across multiple monitoring sites.

The accurate prediction of air quality is crucial to enable management authorities and vulnerable populations to take measures to minimize their exposure to hazardous pollutants. Although many methods have been developed to predict air quality data, the spatio-temporal correlation of air quality data is complex and nonstationary, which makes air quality prediction still challenging. To address this, we propose a novel spatio-temporal neural network, GCNInformer, that combines the graph convolution network with Informer to predict air quality data. GCNInformer incorporates information about the spatial correlations among different monitoring sites through GCN layers and acquires both short-term and long-term temporal information in air quality data through Informer layers. Moreover, GCNInformer uses MLP layers to learn low-dimensional representations from meteorological and air quality data. These designs give GCNInformer the ability to capture the complex and nonstationary relationships between air pollutants and their surrounding environment, allowing for more accurate predictions. The experimental results demonstrate that GCNInformer outperforms other methods in predicting both short-term and long-term air quality data. Thus, the use of GCNInformer can provide useful information for air pollutant prevention and management, which can greatly improve public health by alerting individuals and communities to potential air quality hazards. © 2023 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su15097624,1,1,Yes,"GNN,CNN",ENS,yes,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate air pollution forecasting can help people to reduce exposure risks and promote environmental pollution control, and it is also an extremely important part of smart city management. However, the current deep-learning-based models for air pollution forecasting usually focus on prediction accuracy improvement without considering the model interpretability. These models usually fail to explain the complex relationships between prediction targets and external factors (e.g., ozone concentration (O (Formula presented.)), wind speed, temperature variation, etc.) The relationships between variables in air pollution time series prediction problems are very complex, with intricate relationships between different types of variables, often with nonlinear multivariate dependencies. To address these problems mentioned above, we proposed a hybrid autoformer network with a genetic algorithm optimization to predict air pollution temporal variation as well as establish interpretable relationships between pollutants and external variables. Furthermore, an elite variable voting operator was designed to better filter out more important external factors such as elite variables, so as to perform a more refined search for elite variables. Moreover, we designed an archive storage operator to reduce the effect of neural network model initialization on the search for external variables. Finally, we conducted comprehensive experiments on the Ma’anshan air pollution dataset to verify the proposed model, where the prediction accuracy was improved by 2–8%, and the selection of model influencing factors was more interpretable. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14050869,1,1,Yes,TNN,ENS,yes,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban air quality is pivotal, given its impact on health, necessitating accurate pollutant forecasting and emission reduction strategies to ensure overall well-being. This study forecasts the influence of green energy transport systems on the air quality in Lahore and Islamabad, Pakistan, while noting the projected surge in electric vehicle adoption from less than 1% to 10% within three years. Predicting the impact of this change involves analyzing data before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown led to minimal fossil fuel vehicle usage, resembling a green energy transportation scenario. The novelty of this work is twofold. Firstly, remote sensing data from the Sentinel-5P satellite were utilized to predict air quality index (AQI) trends before, during, and after COVID-19. Secondly, deep learning models, including long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM, and machine learning models, including decision tree and random forest regression, were utilized to forecast the levels of NO (Formula presented.), SO (Formula presented.), and CO in the atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that implementing green energy transportation systems in urban centers of developing countries can enhance air quality by approximately 98%.

High-complexity machine learning models have been widely used for PM concentration prediction, but such models are often considered as “black boxes”, lacking interpretability. Here, a simple structure lightGBM model is built for ground PM estimation, and the SHAP approach is used to separate the meteorological contributions due to its strong influence on PM concentration. The models show good performance with correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.84–0.88, 0.80–0.85, and 0.71–0.79, for PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5-10 (2.5–10 μm), respectively. The lightGBM model trains 45 times faster than the XGBoost model while showing similar accuracy. More importantly, the models have small performance gaps between training and predicting (delta R2: 0.07–0.12), effectively reducing overfitting risk. The PM datasets (10 km daily) of three size ranges are then generated over China from 2000 to 2020. The SHAP method shows good agreement with the meteorological normalization approach in separating the meteorological contributions (R2 > 0.5). In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH), meteorology has greater influence on PM2.5-10 (−5.66%–9.99%) than PM2.5 and PM10. In the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD), albedo has a large contribution to PM2.5 concentration under the influence of solar radiation. Notably, relative humidity (RH) has different seasonal effects on PM of three size ranges. In the BTH region, RH has negative effects on PM2.5 (−0.52 μg/m3) and positive effects on PM10 (1.01 μg/m3) and PM2.5-10 (3.39 μg/m3) in spring, but has opposite effects in summer.

Current approaches rarely consider relative geographical locations when capturing spatial-temporal relations, instead the latent inter-dependencies (i.e., implicit spatial relations) of data as a replacement. However, such relations cannot necessarily reflect the diffusion of air pollutants in the real world, and genuine location-related information could be lost during the implicit relation learning process. In this article, we introduce a new concept, geospatial-temporal data, and propose a novel deep neural network architecture, CoupledGT, to learn the geospatial-temporal couplings within data for air quality prediction. Specifically, the asymmetric diffusion relation of air quality data between two areas is first explicitly represented by the newly developed planar Gaussian diffusion (PGD) equation. And then, a geospatial couplings diffuser (GCD) is designed to parameterize the PGD equation and learn multi-areas diffusion mutually affected geospatial couplings. Besides, the RNN is employed to capture temporal couplings of each area, and incorporated with GCD to learn both shared and unique characteristics of the geospatial-temporal data simultaneously, which empowers the generalization and efficiency of the model.

It is reported that surface O3 has seen a significant increase in many cities from 2019 to 2021 (COVID-19 pandemic). In this study, we applied an innovative machine learning model (Deep Forest) coupled with satellites, the Troposphere Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and meteorological datasets to estimate monthly surface O3 of 1 km spatial resolution across China during this pandemic period. Our model achieved an overall R2 of 0.974, 0.963, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.016 μg/m3, 7.214 μg/m3 on TROPOMI-based datasets and OMI-based datasets, respectively. Also, we found the higher ozone concentration regions were in Eastern China. Simultaneously, the surface O3 concentration was high in summer(average = 110.57 ± 15.01 μg/m3). And the ozone concentration in summer 2020 (average = 107.78 ± 13.90 μg/m3) declined unprecedently than in summer 2019 (average = 110.54 ± 16.58 μg/m3). Our results indicated that TROPOMI data could provide robust data support for surface ozone concentration estimation. Furthermore, this study could enhance our comprehension of the formation mechanisms of surface O3 in China and assist air environment management decision-making. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Atmospheric Environment,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119819,1,1,Yes,DF,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the context of global climate change, air quality prediction work has a substantial impact on humans’ daily lives. The current extensive usage of machine learning models for air quality forecasting has resulted in significant improvements to the sector. The long short-term memory network is a deep learning prediction model, which adds a forgetting layer to a recurrent neural network and has several applications in air quality prediction. The experimental data presented in this research include air pollution data (SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, and CO) and meteorological data (temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, and wind speed). Initially, using air pollution data to calculate the air pollution index (AQI) and the wavelet transform with the adaptive Stein risk estimation threshold is utilized to enhance the quality of meteorological data.

Alternatively, high-resolution satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data can be employed for high-resolution mapping of PM2.5. For this purpose, different data-driven methods have been used in the literature. Recently, deep learning methods have demonstrated their ability to estimate PM2.5 from AOD data. However, these methods have several weaknesses in solving the problem of estimating PM2.5 from satellite AOD data. In this paper, the potential of the deep ensemble forest method for estimating the PM2.5 concentration from AOD data was evaluated. The results showed that the deep ensemble forest method with R2= 0.74 gives a higher accuracy of PM2.5 estimation than deep learning methods (R2= 0.67) as well as classic data-driven methods such as random forest (R2= 0.68).

While many relevant issues have been widely studied, research into ambient air pollutant concentration prediction (APCP) during COVID-19 is still in its infancy. Most of the existing study on APCP is based on machine learning methods, which are not suitable for APCP during COVID-19 due to the different distribution of historical observations before and after the pandemic. Therefore, to fulfill the predictive task based on the historical observations with a different distribution, this paper proposes an improved transfer learning model combined with machine learning for APCP during COVID-19. Specifically, this paper employs the Gaussian mixture method and an optimization algorithm to obtain a new source domain similar to the target domain for further transfer learning. Then, several commonly used machine learning models are trained in the new source domain, and these well-trained models are transferred to the target domain to obtain APCP results. Based on the real-world dataset, the experimental results suggest that, by using the improved machine learning methods based on transfer learning, our method can achieve the prediction with significantly high accuracy.

An integral part of the DT pipeline is the presence of feedback that can influence future input data.

We identify the most important air pollutants influencing the air quality of Kolkata during three different periods using Random Forest, a tree-based machine learning (ML) algorithm. It is found that the ambient air quality of Kolkata is mainly affected with the aid of particulate matter or PM (PM10 and PM2.5). However, the effect of the lockdown is most prominent on PM2.5 which spreads in the air of Kolkata due to diesel-driven vehicles, domestic and commercial combustion activities, road dust, and open burning. To predict urban PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations 24 h in advance, we use a deep learning (DL) model, namely, stacked-bidirectional long short-term memory (stacked-BDLSTM). The model is trained during the normal periods, and it shows the superiority over some supervised ML models, like support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor classifier, multilayer perceptron, long short-term memory, and statistical time series forecasting model autoregressive integrated moving average. This pre-trained stacked-BDLSTM is applied to predict the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 during the pandemic situation of two cases, viz., complete lockdown and partial lockdown using a deep model-based transfer learning (TL) approach (TLS-BDLSTM). Transfer learning aims to utilize the information gained from one problem to improve the predictive performance of a learning model for a different but related problem. Our work helps to demonstrate how TL is useful when there is a scarcity of data during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the drastic change in concentration of pollutants. The results reveal the best prediction performance of TLS-BDLSTM with a lead time of 24 h as compared to some well-known traditional ML and statistical models and the pre-trained stacked-BDLSTM. The prediction is then validated using the real-time data obtained during the complete lockdown due to COVID second wave (16 May–15 June 2021) with different time steps, e.g., 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96–120 h. TLS-BDLSTM involving transfer learning is seen to outperform the said comparing methods in modeling the long-term temporal dependency of multivariate time series data and boost the forecast efficiency not only in single step, but also in multiple steps. The proposed methodologies are effective, consistent, and can be used by operational organizations to utilize in monitoring and management of air quality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,10.1007/s10661-022-10761-x,1,1,Yes,LSTM,STACK,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The parameters, NO, NO2, O3, PM10, RH, HyC, T, and P are significant factors affecting air pollution in Jeddah city. These factors were considered as the input parameters of the ANNs, MARS, SVR, and Hybrid model to determine the effect of those factors on the SO2 quality level. Hence, ANN was employed to approximate the nonlinear relation between SO2 and input parameters. The MARS approach has successful applications in air pollution predictions as an ML tool, employed in this study. The SVR approach was used as a nonlinear modeling tool to predict the SO2 quality level. Furthermore, the MARS and SVR approaches were integrated to develop a novel hybrid modeling scheme for providing a nonlinear approximation of SO2 concentration. The main innovation of this hybrid approach applied for predicting the SO2 quality levels is to develop an efficient approach and reduce the time-consuming calibration processes.

An increasing trend in particulate matter, PM 2.5, is a threat because it can lead to uncontrollable consequences like worsening of asthma and cardiovascular disease. The metric used to measure air quality is the air pollutant index (API). In Malaysia, machine learning (ML) techniques for PM 2.5 have received less attention as the concentration is on predicting other air pollutants. To fill the research gap, this study focuses on correctly predicting PM 2.5 concentrations in the smart cities of Malaysia by comparing supervised ML techniques, which helps to mitigate its adverse effects. Methods In this paper, ML models for forecasting PM 2.5 concentrations were investigated on Malaysian air quality data sets from 2017 to 2018. The dataset was preprocessed by data cleaning and a normalization process. Next, it was reduced into an informative dataset with location and time factors in the feature extraction process. The dataset was fed into three supervised ML classifiers, which include random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). Finally, their output was evaluated using the confusion matrix and compared to identify the best model for the accurate prediction of PM 2.5. Results Overall, the experimental result shows an accuracy of 97.7% was obtained by the RF model in comparison with the accuracy of ANN (61.14%) and LSTM (61.77%) in predicting PM 2.5. Discussion RF performed well when compared with ANN and LSTM for the given data with minimum features. RF was able to reach good accuracy as the model learns from the random samples by using decision tree with the maximum vote on the predictions. © 2022 Palanichamy N et al.",F1000Research,10.12688/f1000research.73166.1,2,1,Yes,"RF,ANN,LSTM",,,"Malaysia,India",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, decision-makers need low-cost, efficient tools with high spatiotemporal representation for monitoring air pollutants around urban areas and sensitive regions. Air pollution forecasting models with different time steps and forecast lengths are used as an alternative and support to traditional air quality monitoring stations (AQMS). In recent decades, given their eligibility to reconcile the relationship between parameters of complex systems, artificial neural networks have acquired the utmost importance in the field of air pollution forecasting. In this study, different machine learning regression methods are used to establish a mathematical relationship between air pollutants and meteorological factors from four AQMS (A-D) located between Çerkezköy and Süleymanpaşa, Tekirdağ. The model input variables included air pollutants and meteorological parameters. All developed models were used with the intent to provide instantaneous prediction of the air pollutant parameter NOx within the AQMS and across different stations. In the GMDH (group method of data handling)-type neural network method (namely the self-organizing deep learning approach), a five hidden layer structure consisting of a maximum of five neurons was preferred and, choice of layers and neurons were made in a way to minimize the error. In all models developed, the data were divided into a training (80%) and a testing set (20%). Based on R2, RMSE, and MAE values of all developed models, GMDH provided superior results regarding the NOx prediction within AQMS (reaching 0.94, 10.95, and 6.65, respectively for station A) and between different AQMS. The GMDH model yielded NOx prediction of station B by using station A input variables (without using NOx data as model input) with R2, RMSE and MAE values 0.80, 10.88, 7.31 respectively. The GMDH model is found suitable for being employed to fill in the gaps of air pollution records within and across-AQMS.

Here we assess the interactions between urban forms and airborne NO2 pollution in different cities with various stages of urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China, by using the machine learning and geographical regression model. The results reveal a strong correlation between urban fragmentation and tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (TVCD) in YRD cities in 2020, particularly those with lower or higher levels of urbanization. The correlation coefficients (R2) between NO2 TVCD and the largest patch index (a metric of urban fragmentation) in different cities are greater than 0.8. For cities at other urbanization stages, population and road density are strongly correlated with NO2 TVCD, with an R2 larger than 0.61.

With this in mind, Macau needs an air quality forecast system that accurately predicts pollutant concentration during the occurrence of pollution episodes to warn the public ahead of time. Five different state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to create predictive models to forecast PM2.5, PM10, and CO concentrations for the next 24 and 48 h, which included artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), and multiple linear regression (MLR), to determine the best ML algorithms for the respective pollutants and time scale. The diurnal measurements of air quality data in Macau from 2016 to 2021 were obtained for this work. The 2020 and 2021 datasets were used for model testing, while the four-year data before 2020 and 2021 were used to build and train the ML models. Results show that the ANN, RF, XGBoost, SVM, and MLR models were able to provide good performance in building up a 24-h forecast with a higher coefficient of determination (R-2) and lower root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and biases (BIAS). Meanwhile, all the ML models in the 48-h forecasting performance were satisfactory enough to be accepted as a two-day continuous forecast even if the R-2 value was lower than the 24-h forecast. The 48-h forecasting model could be further improved by proper feature selection based on the 24-h dataset, using the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) value test and the adjusted R-2 value of the 48-h forecasting model. In conclusion, the above five ML algorithms were able to successfully forecast the 24 and 48 h of pollutant concentration in Macau, with the RF and SVM models performing the best in the prediction of PM2.5 and PM10, and CO in both 24 and 48-h forecasts.",SUSTAINABILITY,10.3390/su15065341,1,1,Yes,"ANN,RF,XGB,SVM,LR",,,Peoples R China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data-based deep learning (DL) model exhibited good performance in simulating urban air quality: the correlation coefficients (R) of O-3 daily variabilities with respect to independent O-3 observations are 0.88 and 0.79 over N.

Furthermore, the data-based methods suggest volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regimes in urban areas over northern inland China and transitional regimes over eastern US urban areas; in contrast, GEOS-Chem model suggests strong NOx-limited regimes. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the inconsistent O-3 responses are partially caused by the inaccurate representation of O-3 precursor concentrations at the locations of urban air quality stations in the simulations, while the data-based methods are driven by the variabilities in local O-3 precursor concentrations and meteorological conditions.

Various estimation methods are employed to determine the PM10 concentration using historical data on controlling PM10 air pollution, early warning, and protecting public health and the environment. The present study analyses different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models that can predict hourly PM10 concentration. In parallel, the study also investigates the effectiveness of the data preprocessing and feature selection (DPFS) process on the prediction accuracy of the LSTM models. For this purpose, three different LSTM models, namely Vanilla, Bi-Directional, and Stacked, were developed. Then, a comprehensive data preprocessing stage is used to eliminate missing and erroneous data and outliers from real-world raw data, and a feature selection process is applied to extract unnecessary features. The LSTM models consider three air quality parameters, including SO2, O3, and CO, and three meteorological factors, including relative humidity, wind direction, and wind speed. The prediction performances of the LSTM models are compared using the RMSE, MAE and R2 performance index according to whether DPFS is used in the models or not. As a result, when the DPFS process was applied, the proposed LSTM models achieved high prediction performance and can be used to predict hourly PM10 concentrations. Overall, the DPFS process significantly enhanced the developed LSTM modelsÂ prediction performance.

Because air quality greatly affects the everyday existence of human, it is essential to examine the changes in air quality and predict them precisely. Our investigation focused on gauging and foreseeing the air quality of 145 crossways/intersections for smart urban communities, like Ahmedabad, Gujarat in India independently because air quality varies from intersection to intersection as it depends on several parameters, like traffic, industrial area, time of the day, etc. The significant issue with this investigation is the accessibility of the dataset for every crossway of the city. To address the issue we have created the estimation information for the air quality index (AQI) for Ahmedabad city from a similar approach as the dataset produced for Aarhus city, Denmark. The aftereffect of this examination is promising to foresee the air quality index for the intersections, utilizing artificial neural network (ANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). At last, we examine and compare the correctness of different configurations using root mean square error in the prediction of the actual vs predicted AQI using the proposed configuration. In this paper air quality index for Ahmedabad city is generated from the same methodology as the data of Aarhus city, Denmark generated for the period of 1/8/2018 to 1/10/2018. The previous studies were based on predicting an AQI for the whole city. The novel part of this study is to develop a dataset for the Ahmedabad city, Gujarat, India and junctionwise prediction of the AQI. Moreover, the paper has proposed the client-server model to get the prediction of AQI for different 145 crossways in the city. Paper derives the conclusion that for the given dataset, the LSTM predicts AQI more accurately than the ANN. This paper is a critical inspiration for inquiring into urban air quality as well as to help the administration to design gainful strategies.

Therefore, air pollution estimation and prediction are crucial for effecting timely control measures. This paper proposes an ensemble deep particulate forecaster (EDPF) to predict hourly PM2.5 concentrations for a day ahead. Air quality data from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala (an Indian state), is used as a case study to demonstrate the model. The effect of other pollutant concentrations and various meteorological parameters on PM2.5 prediction is first studied using Pearson correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination method. Thus, the most relevant features for the forecast of PM2.5 concentrations are identified. Then preliminary PM2.5 predictions are made using two base predictors: an attention-based convolutional neural network - bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory model (BiLSTM). Finally, a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) model combines the preliminary predictions yielding the final PM2.5 predictions. The proposed model is validated for long-term forecasting of PM2.5 at Thiruvananthapuram, and the model attains root mean squared error of 12.96 Âµg/m3 and mean absolute error of 9.28 Âµg/m3 for forecasting 24 h ahead PM2.5 concentrations. The experimental results demonstrate that the model performs better compared to various deep learning models in the literature. The effectiveness of the model in all four seasons is also evaluated, which reveals winter is the most challenging season to forecast.

This knowledge will help to achieve and maintain cleaner air in metropolitan cities. In this paper, air quality index of Indian cities has been forecasted. The time series model is employed to predict individual concentration of each major pollutant causing air pollution. Based on this data, two regression techniques have been used to predict the air quality index.

However, few studies have investigated the ability of machine learning to predict the pollutant concentration with using unrefined mobile measurement data and explore the reliability of the prediction models. Additionally, researchers are moving away from using fixed-site data in favor of using mobile monitoring data in a variety of locations to develop hourly empirical models of particulate air pollution. This study compared the differences between long-term (daily average) and short-term (hourly average and 1 s unrefined data) model performance in three different classes of cross validation: randomly, spatially, and spatially temporally. This study used secondary data describing BC and PN pollutant levels in the rural location of Blacksburg (VA). Our results show that the model based on unrefined data was able to detect the pollutant hot spot areas with similar accuracy compared to the aggregated model. Moreover, the performance was found to improve when temporal data added to the model: the 10-fold MAE for the BC and PN were 0.44 ?g/m3 and 3391 pt/cm3, respectively, for the unrefined data (one second data) model.

To this end, we conducted a case study with Xuzhou as an example.In order to describe the spatial distribution of PM2.5 in detail at urban scale, this study used the PM2.5 concentration data from 172 grid monitoring stations in Xuzhou, the apparent reflectance and aerosol optical thickness data from the Himawari-8/AHI and COMS/GOCI, meteorological data from ERA5 and other auxiliary data to carry out fine mapping study of PM2.5 concentration on the 0.005Â° spatial resolution grid.

Besides, these two datasets use the data from national grid monitoring stations as the validation data..The following conclusions can be drawn:(1) Due to its higher temporal resolution, geostationary satellite measurements can better fit hourly urban grid monitoring station data in model prediction, and is more suitable for urban PM2.5 fine mapping than polar orbit satellite;(2) The estimation results based on urban grid monitoring stations and satellite measurements can make up for the lack of sparse national control stations to a certain extent, better reflect the difference of PM2.5 concentration distribution between different regions within a city, and better serve the accurate control of air pollution.

For risk assessment and epidemiological investigations, a better knowledge of the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 concentration in a constant space-time area is essential. Conventional spatiotemporal interpolation approaches commonly relying on robust presumption by limiting interpolation algorithms to those with explicit and basic mathematical expression, ignoring a plethora of hidden but crucial manipulating aspects. Many advanced deep learning approaches have been proposed to forecast Particulate Matter (PM2.5). Recurrent neural network (RNN) is one of the popular deep learning architectures which is widely employed in PM2.5 concentration forecasting. In this research, we proposed a Two-State Gated Recurrent Unit (TS-GRU) for monitoring and estimating the PM2.5 concentration forecasting system.

First of all, we based on spatial correlation to divide 1286 air quality monitoring stations across the country in space adaptively and built a multi-layer LSTM iterative model for each region to achieve the PM2.5 concentration forecast of each monitoring site in the next 24 hours. Secondly, the improved S-BPNN spatialization model was applied to realize the refined mapping of PM2.5 concentration in a large continuous spatial coverage across the country in the next 24 hours.

The results show that the correlation coefficients R2 of the forecast model and the spatialized model are respectively 0.88 and 0.89, indicating that the two models could achieve high accuracy.
