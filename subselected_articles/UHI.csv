The effect of UHI can be described quantitatively by urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). For measuring urban health and ensuring sustainable development, the analysis of LST and UTFVI are receiving boosted attention. This study predicted LULC, seasonal (summer & winter) LST, and UTFVI variations using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) in Cumilla City Corporation (CCC), Bangladesh. Landsat 4â5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellite images were used for 1999, 2009, and 2019 to predict future scenarios for 2029 and 2039. MLAs such as Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods were used to predict the future change in LULC, LST, and UTFVI. The result suggests that, in the year 2029 and 2039, the urban area will likely to be increased by around 8 % and 11 %, where significant decrease will be taken place in green cover by 9 % and 14 %. If the rapid urban growth continues, more than 30 % of the CCC area will likely to be experienced more than 33 Â°C temperature and strongest UTFVI effect in the year 2029 and 2039. In addition, an average 4 Â°C higher LST was recorded in the urban area compared with vegetation cover. In urban construction practice, avoiding concentrated impermeable layers (built-up areas) and increasing green covers, are effective ways of mitigating the effect of UTFVI. This study will contribute in achieving sustainable development and provide useful insights to understand the complex relationship among different elements of urban environments and promotion of city competence.

Although previous studies have shown that urban heat island (UHI) intensity will be easily affected by the landscape pattern of green space, the relationship between the morphological spatial pattern of green space and UHI intensity remains to be discovered. Compared with landscape pattern, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) can reveal more specific details on the configuration and composition of land use. Therefore, this study aims to explore whether the morphological spatial pattern of land use matters to UHI using machine learning methods. Firstly, the morphological characteristics of green space were analyzed based on MSPA. Secondly, the linear associations between UHI intensity and a set of potential influencing factors (including morphological characteristics) were measured according to correlation coefficient. Lastly, the non-linear contribution of the morphological factors to UHI intensity was quantified based on random forest. An empirical case study in a rapidly-urbanized city has revealed the huge influence of morphological characteristics on UHI intensity with benchmark factors considered. The UHI intensity was negatively correlated with the cores, perforations, and loops of green space, but positively correlated with islets. Therefore, a few large core areas would be better than a large number of small islets when the total amount of green space is fixed. In addition, the fragmented patches of green space should be integrated or connected to enhance the cooling capacity. Our findings could offer some insights for UHI mitigation and land use planning, especially when the size of green space cannot be unlimitedly increased. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","School of Geography and Remote Sensing, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, 510006, China",Building and Environment,10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109910,26,26,Yes,RF,China,Yes,UHII,Relationship between UHII and MSPA green areas (shape).

In this study, we developed specific daytime and nighttime multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models to analyze and predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the Urban Heat Island intensity (UHII), using the air temperature (Tair) as the response variable. We profited from the wealth of in situ Tair data and a comprehensive pool of predictors variables â including land cover, population, traffic, urban geometry, weather data and atmospheric vertical indices. Cluster analysis divided the study period into three main groups, each dominated by a combination of weather systems that, in turn, influenced the onset and strength of the UHII. Anticyclonic circulations favored the emergence of the largest UHII (hourly mean of 5.06 Â°C), while cyclonic circulations dampened its development. The MLR models were only able to explain a modest percentage of variance (64 and 34% for daytime and nighttime, respectively), which we interpret as part of their inability to capture key factors controlling Tair. The RF models, on the other hand, performed considerably better, with explanatory power over 96% of the variance for daytime and nighttime conditions, capturing and mapping the fine-scale Tair spatiotemporal variability in both periods and under each cluster condition. The feature importance analysis showed that the meteorological variables and the land cover were the main predictors of the Tair. Urban planners could benefit from these results, using the high-performing RF models as a robust framework for forecasting and mitigating the effects of the UHI.

The urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) can effectively describe any city's UHI (thermal characteristics) effect. This study aims to assess and predict the seasonal (summer and winter) UTFVI scenario to evaluate the thermal characteristics of Sylhet city, Bangladesh. Landsat 4â5 TM and 8 OLI images from 1995 to 2020 were used to assess the previous status of LULC and UTFVI and predict the future changes for 2025 and 2030 using cellular automata and artificial neural network machine learning algorithms. Prediction results indicate a substantial increase in urban built-up areas by 42% and 44% in 2025 and 2035, followed by reductions in green cover (21% and 22%), bare land (20% and 21%) and water bodies (1%). The rapid expansion of built-up areas will lead to 13 km2 and 14 km2 stronger UTFVI zones in the predicted years. The study provides effective strategies for mitigating the UTFVI effects by avoiding dense infrastructural development, increasing plantation and water bodies, rooftop gardening and using white colour roofs in construction. The findings of this study will allow the urban planners, policymakers and local government to ensure an eco-friendly, inclusive and sustainable urban development through functional modification and replacement of the LULC distribution depending on the present and future circumstances.

The present study emphasizes the prediction of LULC, seasonal LST, and urban thermal field variance (UTFVI) over Ahmedabad city, India using multi date Landsat data. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Cellular Automata (CA) model is use to predict the LULC, while the XGB Regression model is used to predict seasonal LST with input data from 2010, 2015, and 2020 to predict future scenarios of 2025 and 2030. The result suggests an addition in the built-up area of about 5.77% and 13.08%, while a deduction in cropland area of about 4.15% and 12.54% is manifest in the year 2025 and 2030, respectively. This excessive urban growth in the study area will cause to face higher LST ranges of greater than 45 Â°C (24.9 km2 in 2025 and 24.2 km2 in 2030) in summer and 35 Â°C (19.9 km2 in 2025 and 43.6 km2 in 2030) in winter. The concentration of higher LST zones is evident in the rural areas than urban areas, witnessing cool urban islands. The predicted LST analysis suggests a dominant occurrence of none UTFVI zone in the city area and the strongest UTFVI zone in the surrounding rural area during both the seasons. An increase in green space area and avoidance of non-impermeable surfaces is suggest in future scenarios to mitigate UHI. Furthermore, the outcome of the research can help urban planners and policymakers while formulating urban heat island related mitigation strategies in the near-future scenario.

A high-spatial-resolution canopy UHI monitoring method would help better understand the urban thermal environment. Taking the city of Nanjing in China as an example, we propose a method for evaluating canopy UHI intensity (CUHII) at high resolution by using remote sensing data and machine learning with a random forest (RF) model. Firstly, the observed environmental parameters, e.g., surface albedo, land use/land cover, impervious surface, and anthropogenic heat flux (AHF), around densely distributed meteorological stations were extracted from satellite images. These parameters were used as independent variables to construct an RF model for predicting air temperature. The correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed air temperature in the test set was 0.73, and the average root-mean-square error was 0.72ÄÄ C. Then, the spatial distribution of CUHII was evaluated at 30Äm resolution based on the output of the RF model. We found that wind speed was negatively correlated with CUHII, and wind direction was strongly correlated with the CUHII offset direction. The CUHII reduced with the distance to the city center, due to the decreasing proportion of built-up areas and reduced AHF in the same direction. The RF model framework developed for real-time monitoring and assessment of high spatial and temporal resolution (30Äm and 1Äh) CUHII provides scientific support for studying the changes and causes of CUHII, as well as the spatial pattern of urban thermal environments.

Results illustrated transformation of 27.24% bare land and 5.43% vegetation into the built-up area increased the mean LST by 5Â°C, resulting in an upsurge of UHI values by 0.861 and the strongest UFTVI effects by 108% from 1991 to2021.

Moreover, by 2031, 41% of the total study area will be covered by the strongest UTFVI affected zones. All the prediction was performed with a higher accuracy, and validated by RMSE and R2 values with predicted and real datasets.

These factors elevate the urban-rural air temperature (T-a) difference, thus generating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. T-a is used in the fields of public health and epidemiology to quantify deaths attributable to heat in cities around the world: the presence of UHI can exacerbate exposure to high temperatures during summer periods, thereby increasing the risk of heat-related mortality. Measuring and monitoring the spatial patterns of T-a in urban contexts is challenging due to the lack of a good network of weather stations. This study aims to produce a parsimonious model to retrieve maximum T-a (T-max) at high spatio-temporal resolution using Earth Observation (EO) satellite data. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) it will produce daily estimations of T-max for London at 1 km(2) during the summertime between 2006 and 2017 using advanced statistical techniques and satellite-derived predictors, and (ii) it will investigate for the first time the predictive power of the gradient boosting algorithm to estimate T-max for an urban area. In this work, 6 regression models were calibrated with 6 satellite products, 3 geospatial features, and 29 meteorological stations. Stepwise linear regression was applied to create 9 groups of predictors, which were trained and tested on each regression method. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict T-max: the gradient boosting model with a group of five predictors (land surface temperature, Julian day, normalised difference vegetation index, digital elevation model, solar zenith angle) was the regression model with the best performance (R-2 = 0.68, MAE = 1.60 degrees C, and RMSE = 2.03 degrees C). This methodological approach is capable of being replicated in other UK cities, benefiting national heat-related mortality assessments since the data (provided by NASA and the UK Met Office) and programming languages (Python) sources are free and open. This study provides a framework to produce a high spatio-temporal resolution of T-max, assisting public health researchers to improve the estimation of mortality attributable to high temperatures. In addition, the research contributes to practice and policy-making by enhancing the understanding of the locations where mortality rates may increase due to heat. Therefore, it enables a more informed decision-making process towards the prioritisation of actions to mitigate heat-related mortality amongst the vulnerable population.","[dos Santos, Rochelle Schneider] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth Environm & Soc, London, England",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,10.1016/j.jag.2020.102066,48,12,Yes,"LR,RT,RFR,GBRT,SVR,ANN(MLP)",England,Yes,Air temperature,Estimating air temperature,"Meteorological data

To obtain the spatial distributions of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an in summer and develop a simultaneous control strategy of ozone and urban heat island, the land use regression model is modified and improved using the machine learning random forest algorithm. The LUR-Kriging-RF integrated prediction model is then established. The land use regression and kriging are used to extract the feature variables, while random forest is used to establish a regression model. The spatial distribution maps of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an are obtained by regression mapping of the prediction model, and the spatial relationships between them are analyzed. The SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) and partial dependence plot (PDP) are adopted to explain the way feature variables act on ozone and urban heat island. Based on the spatial distribution and interaction mode, a simultaneous control strategy of ozone and urban heat island in Xi'an is put forward. For ozone, the R2 of the integrated prediction model (0.65) is higher than that of land use regression (0.4), while the RMSE (28.18) of the integrated model is lower than that of land use regression (35.66). For temperature, the R2 of the integrated model (0.93) is higher than that of land use regression (0.8), while its RMSE (0.92) is lower than that of land use regression (1.52). The performance of the LUR-Kriging-RF integrated prediction model is better than that of land use regression. This study reveals the spatial interactions between ozone and land use regression in the central urban areas. The suitable strategies for mapping ozone pollution and urban heat island control include reducing VOCs emissions from industrial sources and agricultural sources, increasing plants with low VOCs emissions, and spray humidification. This study can be used to evaluate ozone exposure and thermal exposure, provide scientific support for environmental protection and urban heat island control policies, contribute to reducing public health threats, promote the sustainability of urban environments, and promote the practical application of machine learning in this field.

In the urban context, such adaptation strategies require a thorough understanding of the built-up response to the incoming solar radiation, i.e., the urban energy balance cycle and its implications for the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Despite readily available, diurnal Land Surface Temperature (LST) data does not provide a meaningful picture of the UHI, in these midlatitudes FUAs. On the contrary, the mid-morning satellite overpass is characterized by the absence of a significant surface UHI (SUHI) signal, corresponding to the period of the day when the urban-rural air temperature difference is typically negative. Conversely, nocturnal high-resolution LST data is rarely available. In this study, an energy balance-based machine learning approach is explored, considering the Local Climate Zones (LCZ), to describe the daily cycle of the heat flux components and predict the nocturnal SUHI, during an HW event. While the urban and rural spatial outlines are not visible in the diurnal thermal image, they become apparent in the latent and storage heat flux maps â built-up infrastructures uptake heat during the day which is released back into the atmosphere, during the night, whereas vegetation land surfaces loose diurnal heat through evapotranspiration. For the LST prediction model, a random forest (RF) approach is implemented. RF results show that the model accurately predicts the LST, ensuring mean square errors inferior to 0.1 K. Both the latent and storage heat flux components, together with LCZ classification, are the most important explanatory variables for the nocturnal LST prediction, supporting the adoption of the energy balance approach. In future research, other locations and time-series data shall be trained and tested, providing an efficient local urban climate monitoring tool, where in-situ air temperature observations are not available.

This study provides an in-depth exploration of these relationships in the context of the Kamrup Metropolitan District, Northeast India, over a period of 22 years (2000-2022) and forecasts the potential implications up to 2032. Employing a high-accuracy supervised machine learning algorithm for LULC analysis, significant transformations are revealed, including the considerable growth in urban built-up areas and the corresponding decline in cultivated land. Concurrently, a progressive rise in LST is observed, underlining the escalating UHI effect. This association is further substantiated through correlation studies involving the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The study further leverages the cellular automata-artificial neural network (CA-ANN) model to project the potential scenario in 2032, indicating a predicted intensification in LST, especially in regions undergoing rapid urban expansion. The findings underscore the environmental implications of unchecked urban growth, such as rising temperatures and the intensification of UHI effects. Consequently, this research stresses the critical need for sustainable land management and urban planning strategies, as well as proactive measures to mitigate adverse environmental changes. The results serve as a vital resource for policymakers, urban planners, and environmental scientists working towards harmonizing urban growth with environmental sustainability in the face of escalating global climate change.","[Choudhury, Upasana; Kumar, Anand] Suresh Gyan Vihar Univ, Ctr Climate Change & Water Res, Jaipur 302017, India; [Singh, Suraj Kumar] Suresh Gyan Vihar Univ, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Jaipur 302017, India; [Meraj, Gowhar] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138654, Japan; [Kumar, Pankaj] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Hayama 2400115, Japan; [Kanga, Shruti] Cent Univ Punjab, Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Dept Geog, Bathinda 151401, Punjab, India",EARTH,10.3390/earth4030026,6,6,Yes,ANN,"India,Japan",Yes,UHI,UHI forecast,"LULC

In urban areas, it exacerbates the urban heat island phenomenon. It impacts the health of the inhabitants and the sensation of thermal discomfort felt in urban areas. Thus, it is necessary to estimate as well as possible the air temperature at any point of a territory, in particular in view of the ongoing rationalization of the network of fixed meteorological stations of Meteo-France. Understanding the air temperature is increasingly in demand to input quantitative models related to a wide range of fields, such as hydrology, ecology, or climate change studies. This study thus proposes to model air temperature, measured during four mobile campaigns carried out during the summer months, between 2016 and 2019, in Lyon (France), in clear sky weather, using regression models based on 33 explanatory variables from traditionally used data, data from remote sensing by LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), or Landsat 8 satellite acquisition. Three types of statistical regression were experimented: partial least square regression, multiple linear regression, and a machine learning method, the random forest regression. For example, for the day of 30 August 2016, multiple linear regression explained 89% of the variance for the study days, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 0.23 degrees C. Variables such as surface temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have a strong impact on the estimation model. This study contributes to the emergence of urban cooling systems. The solutions available vary. For example, they may include increasing the proportion of vegetation on the ground, facades, or roofs, increasing the number of basins and water bodies to promote urban cooling, choosing water-retaining materials, humidifying the pavement, increasing the number of public fountains and foggers, or creating shade with stretched canvas.","[Alonso, Lucille; Renard, Florent] Univ Jean Moulin Lyon 3, UMR CNRS 5600 Environm City & Soc, Dept Geog & Spatial Planning, F-69007 Lyon, France",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs12152434,17,5,Yes,"RFR,LR",France,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to the limited observational records of air temperature and the complex urban morphology and environment, it might not be easy to map the hourly air temperature with a fine resolution at the surface level within and around cities via conventional methods. Thus, this study employed machine learning (ML) algorithms and meteorological and landscape data to develop hourly air temperature mapping techniques and methods at the 1-km resolution over a multi-year warm seasons period. Guangdong Province, China was selected for the case study. Random forest algorithm was employed for the hourly air temperature mapping. The validation results showed that the hourly air temperature maps exhibit good accuracy from 2008 to 2019, with mean R2, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.8001, 1.4821 Â°C and 1.0872 Â°C, respectively. The importance assessment of the driving factors showed that meteorological factors, especially relative humidity, contributed the most to the air temperature mapping. Simultaneously, landscape factors also played a non-negligible role. Further analysis revealed that the maps steadily maintained high accuracy at nighttime (20:00â7:00), which is essential for investigating nighttime urban climate conditions, especially the urban heat island effect. Moreover, a correlation existed between the nighttime air temperature changes and urban morphology represented by the local climate zones. Air temperatures tended to fall more slowly in the core of metropolitan areas than in the urban fringe. Using ML, this study reliably improves the spatial refinement of hourly air temperature mapping and reveals the spatially explicit air temperature patterns in and around cities at different times in a day during the warm seasons. Moreover, it provides a novel valuable and reliable dataset for air-temperature-related implementation and studies.

In large-scale climate modeling, a common preliminary operation is to utilize the well-established Local Climate Zone classification to characterize the thermal response of urban areas based on morphology. With the increasing availability of urban datasets, data-driven approaches can be implemented to quantitatively derive meaningful urban features without relying on a standardized classification. The proposed methodology employs a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to partition the urban territory into a suitable number of homogeneous microclimate zones, enabling the calculation and mapping of the UHII for each zone through the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) tool. The developed approach is applied to the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, identifying ten microclimatic areas and analyzing the spatiotemporal variation of UHII. Results show yearly average values of UHII ranging from 1.7 °C to 2.2 °C, depending on urban morphology. The simulated values are partially validated by comparison with on-site measurements from two urban weather stations, yielding a satisfactory agreement.

Among these time scales, estimation of next-day SUHIs is of special significance to urban residents, yet we currently lack a simple but efficient approach for making such estimations. In the present study, we propose a statistical strategy for estimating next-day nighttime SUHIs, based on incorporating various SUHI controls into a support vector machine regression (SVR) model. The majority of both the surface controls (including factors related to land cover and solar radiation) and meteorological controls (including temperature fluctuations, relative humidity, accumulated precipitation, wind speed, aerosol optical depth, and soil moisture) that have previously been found to account for daily SUHI variations were used as estimators, and we provide estimations for both the overall SUHI intensity (SUHII) and pixel-by-pixel Gaussian-based LSTs over 59 Chinese megacities. For the overall SUHII, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.67 K on average, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is no more than 25% for more than 90% of the cities. For the pixel-by-pixel LSTs, the associated MAE is less than 2.0 K in most scenarios. In addition, the contribution from each selected estimator to SUHII estimation is assessed comprehensively. Among all the estimators, the contribution from relative humidity is the greatest, followed by rural surface temperature and surface air temperature. Moreover, for nearly 78% of the cities, the estimators related to day-to-day SUHI variations make a larger contribution than those related to intra-annual SUHI variations. We conclude that our simple yet effective statistical approach for estimating next-day SUHIs can potentially help urban residents to better adapt to urban heat stress.

Recent methodological advances show promise in achieving high spatiotemporal temperature predictions, thus improving the characterization of spatial variations in temperature and decreasing bias in health studies. Here, we applied a two-stage approach using random forest to (a) impute missing moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature at a 1 × 1 km resolution and (b) to use the gap-filled MODIS data to explain spatiotemporal variation in the measured ground-based air temperature data at a 100 × 100 m resolution across Switzerland using a range of predictor variables, including meteorological parameters, normalized difference vegetation index, impervious surface and altitude. Models presented here managed to capture temporal and spatial variations in air temperature in Switzerland from 2003 to 2018 at a fine spatial resolution of 100 × 100 m. Stage 1 models achieved an overall R2 of 0.98 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.49°C (independent validation), and the stage 2 model performed well for all years with R2 and RMSE ranging from 0.94 to 0.99 and 1.05 to 1.86°C, respectively.

Land use change and population growth are known to impact UHI effects. Taking the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration in China as the study context, a rapid and simple method based on artificial neural networks was employed to spatially estimate UHI effects from 2040 to 2100. Considering carbon neutrality and pro-natalist policies, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) were integrated into combination scenarios: RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, and RCP4.5-SSP3. The risk of UHI effects was assessed through UHI hazard and population exposure. Results showed that compared with 2020, heat islands would decrease by 30% - 34% in area but increase by 29% - 37% in mean intensity by 2100. The population impacted by UHIs would increase by >10 million under the third scenario. Areas at high risk of UHI effects are mainly located in the urban core, with the total value of risk across the study area by 2100 being about 2 - 4 times higher than that in 2020. Our findings provide a forward-looking perspective to identify overall risk and critical areas in relation to UHI effects in the future through which clearer climatic-socioeconomic targets can be empirically grounded to minimize damage to public health. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Ministry of Education, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China; Key Laboratory for Environmental and Urban Sciences, School of Urban Planning & Design, Shenzhen Graduate School, Peking University, Shenzhen, 518055, China; Queensland Centre for Population Research, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4072, QLD, Australia",Urban Climate,10.1016/j.uclim.2023.101463,4,4,Yes,ANN,"China,Australia",Yes,LST and UHII at 1km spatial resolution,LST simulation and UHII simulation,"LST

The land surface temperature in the summer and winter seasons has experienced an increase of 0.88 degrees C and similar to 5 degrees C, respectively. While there exists spatial heterogeneity in the UTFVI 1990-2020, the city is expected to experience a similar to 140% increase in areas with severe UTFVI in response to predicted LULC change by 2050. The study provides essential information on LULC change and UTFVI and puts forth useful insights to advance our understanding of the urban climate, which can progressively help in designing more livable and sustainable cities in the face of environmental changes.","[Waleed, Mirza; Sajjad, Muhammad] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Sajjad, Muhammad] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Ctr Geocomputat Studies, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Acheampong, Anthony Owusu] Univ Aberdeen, Kings Coll, Dept Geosci, Aberdeen AB24 3FX, Scotland; [Alam, Md.

In this study, Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites is used to investigate the contribution of potential factors that generate the SUHI phenomenon. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) techniques to model the main temporal and spatial SUHI patterns of Cartago, Colombia, for the period 2001â2020. We test and evaluate the performance of three different emissivity models to retrieve LST. The fractional vegetation cover model using Sentinel-2 data provides the best results with R2 = 0.78, while the ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset v3 and the land surface emissivity model provide R2 = 0.27 and R2 = 0.26, respectively. Our SUHI model reveals that the factors with the highest impact are the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI). Furthermore, we incorporate a weighted NaÃ¯ve Bayes Machine Learning (NBML) algorithm to identify areas prone to extreme temperatures that can be used to define and apply normative actions to mitigate the negative consequences of SUHI.

In this study, we developed a novel 5-layer Deep Belief Network (DBN) deep learning model to fuse multi-source data and then generated air temperature data with 3H characteristics: High resolution, High spatio-temporal continuity (spatially seamless and temporally continuous), and High accuracy simultaneously. The DBN model was developed and applied for two different urban regions: Wuhan Metropolitan Area (WMA) in China, and Austin, Texas, USA. The model has a excellent ability to fit the complex nonlinear relationship between temperature and different predictive variables. After various adjustments to the model structure and different combinations of input variables, the daily 500-m air temperature in Wuhan Metropolitan Area (WMA) was initially generated by fusing remote sensing, reanalysis and in situ measurement products. The ten-fold cross-validation results indicated that the DBN model achieved promising results with the RMSE of 1.086 degrees C, MAE of 0.839 degrees C, and R-2 of 0.986. Compared with conventional data fusion algorithms, the DBN model also exhibited better performance. In addition, the detailed evaluation of the model on spatial and temporal scales proved the advantages of using DBN model to generate 3H temperature data. The spatial transferability of the model was tested by conducting a validation experiment for Austin, USA. In general, the results and fine-scale analyses show that the employed framework is effective to generate 3H temperature, which is valuable for urban climate and urban heat island research.","[Zhang, Xiang; Huang, Tailai; Song, Yu; Chen, Nengcheng] China Univ Geosci, Natl Engn Res Ctr Geog Informat Syst, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiang; Zeng, Jiangyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gulakhmadov, Aminjon] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Gulakhmadov, Aminjon] Natl Acad Sci Tajikistan, Inst Water Problems Hydropower & Ecol, Dushanbe 734042, Tajikistan; [Gu, Xihui] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xihui] Ctr Severe Weather & Climate & Hydrogeol Hazards, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xihui] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Huang, Shuzhe] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Nam, Won-Ho] Hankyong Natl Univ, Natl Agr Water Res Ctr, Sch Social Safety & Syst Engn, Inst Agr Environm Sci, 327 Jungang Ro, Anseong 17579, South Korea; [Chen, Nengcheng] Hubei Luojia Lab, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Niyogi, Dev] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Niyogi, Dev] Univ Texas Austin, Cockrell Sch Engn, Dept Civil Architecture & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",REMOTE SENSING,10.3390/rs14153536,5,3,Yes,DBN,"Peoples R China,Tajikistan,England,South Korea,United States",No,Air temperature,Spatio-Temporally Continuous Air Temperature Generation,"Remotely Sensed Products MOD13Q1 NDVI 250 m 16 Days

It is crucial for urban planning and social development to monitor the urban heat island effect and study its mechanism. Due to spatial and temporal resolution limitations, existing land surface temperature (LST) data obtained from remote sensing data is challenging to meet the long-term fine-scale surface temperature mapping requirement. Given the above situation, this paper introduced the ResNet-based surface temperature downscaling method to make up for the data deficiency and applied it to the study of thermal environment change in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2000 to 2020. The results showed (1) the ResNet-based surface temperature downscaling method achieves high accuracy (R2 above 0.85) and is suitable for generating 30 m-resolution surface temperature data from 1 km data; (2) the area of severe heat islands in the GBA continued to increase, increasing by 7.13 times within 20 years; and (3) except for Hong Kong and Macau, the heat island intensity of most cities showed an apparent upward trend, especially the cities with rapid urban expansion such as Guangzhou, Zhongshan, and Foshan. In general, the evolution of the heat island in the GBA diverges from the central urban area to the surrounding areas, with a phenomenon of local aggregation and the area of the intense heat island in the Guangzhou-Foshan metropolitan area is the largest. This study can enrich the downscaling research methods of surface temperature products in complex areas with surface heterogeneity and provide a reference for urban spatial planning in the GBA. © 2022 by the authors.","Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Natural Resources, Shenzhen, 518040, China; School of Geosciences, Yangtze University, Wuhan, 430100, China; Shenzhen Planning and Natural Resources Data Management Center, Shenzhen, 518040, China; Big Data Technology Research Center, Nanhu Laboratory, Jiaxing, 314000, China; Institute of Geological Survey, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, 430074, China",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,10.3390/ijerph192417001,5,3,Yes,RESCNN,China,Yes,LST,MODIS LST 1000m to 30m,,"LST

This paper presents a novel approach to derive LST estimates by integrating machine learning algorithm and spatiotemporal fusion model at high spatial and temporal resolution. The spatial resolutions of Landsat TM and Landsat 8 LST data were first downscaled using random forest (RF) algorithm from 120 m and 100 m, respectively, to 30 m. The resultant LST data were fused with MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data, by means of the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion method (FSDAF), in order to generate high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST data covering the center of Chengdu city in China. The proposed new method was used to estimate the spatiotemporal variations of the summer daytime SUHI from 2009 to 2018 over Chengdu city. Results show that: (1) RF performs way better than the classical downscaling algorithm-thermal sharpening algorithm (TsHARP) for LST, and produces higher accuracy for different land covers; (2) the fused high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST values were evaluated with in situ LST obtained from Chengdu Meteorological Office and the final validation results indicated that the proposed method, in generating LST dataset, can provide more details of urban thermal environment and produce higher accuracy than the traditional FSDAF; (3) significantly increasing trends of summer daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) in the study area were observed. SUHII increased from 2.78 °C in 2009 to 4.04 °C in 2018.

One of the main impacts is the increase in temperature observed in urban areas, also known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. UHI has become the focus of several research studies due to the associated negative implications it causes. Despite that some research efforts examined different characteristics of the UHI phenomenon, there is a gap in the literature in terms of developing interpretable machine learning models that can accurately estimate or predict the severity of UHI (rather than air temperature or other UHI characteristics) as well as that can provide predictions on the census-tract level in the US. To that extent, this paper fills this gap by developing a knowledge-based white-box Bayesian network model that predicts UHI severity based on demographic, meteorological, and land use/land cover factors. First, a dataset for all census tracts in the state of New Jersey, USA was developed, which is comprised of 13 independent variables or factors affecting UHI severity. Second, expert knowledge was obtained from 10 UHI experts using the systematic three-round Delphi method to develop four different Bayesian network models. Third, the performance of the four Bayesian models was assessed and compared to choose the optimal model with the highest accuracy. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of each key factor on the UHI severity. The results showed that the optimal model is a tree-augmented Bayesian network that can predict or estimate the UHI severity with an accuracy of 87.88%. The outcomes of this paper also reflected that the following 8 variables are the key factors that impact UHI severity: NDVI during winter season, NDVI during summer season, imperviousness, tree canopy, building area, population density, water body areas, and annual rainfall. The findings also identified the land use/land cover category as the major category affecting UHI severity compared to demographic- and meteorological-related factors. The proposed white-box Bayesian network model in this paper adds to the body of knowledge by allowing practitioners and researchers to perform micro-level UHI predictions and inferences about future or unknown UHI severity pertaining to individual communities or small/localized geographical areas. This enables more focused and targeted UHI mitigation actions to be planned, designed, and implemented in the most affected communities, which ultimately results in better decisions, actions, and outcomes to reduce or address the UHI effect. © 2023","Smart Construction and Intelligent Infrastructure Systems (SCIIS) lab, John A.

Qingdao was selected in this study as a typical coastal city undergoing rapid urbanization, and the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of its urban surface thermal environment from 2010 to 2019 were evaluated. The random forest (RF) algorithm was adopted to obtain its land surface temperature (LST) map with 30-m resolution by downscaling the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product; the remote sensing indices emphasizing different land cover types, LST calculated by the radiative transfer equation, and elevation were used as input variables in the algorithm. The heat island intensity (HII), urban heat island (UHI) volume, and UHI grade were used to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of the urban surface thermal environment in Qingdao. The results show an increasing trend in average HII between 1.1 and 2.52°C in the study area over the past 10 years. The northern city appeared to have the highest UHI volume, while change of the UHI volume in Huangdao District of southwestern Qingdao was the most significant. The areas with high HII have gradually expanded during the last 10 years, and the areas with a 10-yr persistently high HII are distributed mainly in old urban areas with high building density and a dense population. Different factors may influence UHI, such as artificial heat sources, surface heat sources, and hybrid heat sources. Finally, adjusting the urban structure, increasing the vegetated area, and changing building colors are proposed to mitigate UHI in the areas with continuously high HII. © 2021, The Chinese Meteorological Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","School of Geosciences, Yangtze University, Wuhan, 430100, China; Nanhu Laboratory, Jiaxing, 314002, China; Beijing Big Data Advanced Technology Institute, Beijing, 100871, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Sciences, Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China",Journal of Meteorological Research,10.1007/s13351-021-0023-4,8,3,Yes,RF,China,Yes,"HII, UHI","HII, UHI, and high resultion temperature","Land Use, NDVI, SAVI, MNDWI, NDBI, MNDISI, BI

Population growth and urbanization result in negative consequences on the environment. Such land has experienced various environmental issues due to rapid urbanization and population increases. Such expansion in urbanization has a big impact on worsening the residences soon and in the long term, as the population is projected to increase more and more. One such issue is the urban heat island (UHI), which is computed based on land surface temperature (LST). The UHI effect has fundamental anthropogenic impacts on local areas, particularly in rapidly growing cities. This is due to the unplanned shifts in land use and land cover (LUALC) at the local level, which results in climate condition variations. Therefore, proper planning based on concrete information is the best policy in the long run to remedy these issues. In this study, we attempt to map out UHI phenomena using machine learning (ML) algorithms, including bagging and random subspace. The proposed research also fulfills the sustainable development goals (SDGs) requirement. We exploit the correlation and regression methods to understand the relationship between biophysical composition and the UHI effect. Our findings indicate that in the megacity of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from 2000 to 2021, the urban area enlarged by about 80%, while the UHI increased overall. Impervious surfaces significantly impact the UHI effect, while vegetation and water bodies have negative implications for the UHI effect. More than 80% of the total parts in Jeddah have been classified by extremely high UHI conditions, as determined by the bagging and random subspace models. In particular, the megacity's south, north, and central-east parts were categorized by very high UHI conditions. This research is not only expected to assist in understanding the spatial patterns of the UHI in Jeddah, but to assist planners and policymakers in spatial planning. It will help to ensure sustainable urban management and improve life quality.","[Addas, Abdullah] Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Alkharj 11942, Saudi Arabia; [Addas, Abdullah] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Architecture & Planning, Landscape Architecture Dept, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia",LAND,10.3390/land12061159,3,3,Yes,BDT,Saudi Arabia,Yes,UHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the different Bayesian networks were assessed and compared to determine the optimal structure. Finally, the best model was validated on an unseen testing sample where an overall accuracy of 88.51% was obtained.

The development of a machine learning model provides a good means of solving complex problems. This study aims to clarify the relationship between urban environmental variables and the urban thermal environment through high-precision machine learning models as well as provide scenarios of future urban thermal environment developments. We defined an urban thermal environment index (UTEI), considering twelve urban form and natural indicators sourced from the remote sensing data of 150 cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji region from 2000 to 2015. We achieved accurate predictions of UTEI through training a gradient-boosted regression trees model. By unpacking the model, we found that the contribution rate of elevation (ELEV) was the highest. Among all the urban form indicators, the elongation index (ELONG), urban population (POP), nighttime light intensity (NLI), urban area size (AREA), and urban shape index (SHAPE) also had high contributions. We set up five scenarios to simulate the possible impact of different urban form factors on the overall urban thermal environment quality in the region. Under extremely deteriorated patterns that do not control urban expansion and vegetation reduction, the average UTEI could be as high as 0.55â0.76 Â°C in summer and 0.24â0.29 Â°C in winter, yet in the extremely optimized situation, UTEI decreased by 0.69 Â°C in summer and 0.56 Â°C in winter. Results showed that better urban form improves the quality of urban environments and can provide important insights for urban planners to mitigate urban heat island problems.

The land surface temperature (LST) extracted from thermal images is a primary source of information to study UHI, characterizing the surface urban heat islands (SUHI). In addition to LST, environmental and socioeconomic variables have been adopted to explain the SUHI phenomenon. Although machine learning algorithms have potential in several areas, their application in the study of the contribution of these variables in the prediction of LST to characterize SUHI is still unknown. Therefore, the work proposes a machine learning approach to fill this gap. The LST was extracted from 15 Landsat 8 images from 2019 to 2021. Data on socioeconomic variables were obtained from the official demographic census, and environmental variables were extracted from Sentinel-2 and Planet images. Six algorithms were tested to assess the ability to estimate the LST based on the above-mentioned variables. The results showed that the Decision Tree algorithm had the best performance (r = 0.96, MAE = 1.49 °C and RMSE = 1.88 °C), followed by Random Forest. In addition, the inclusion of all seasons of the year and socioeconomic variables was shown to be relevant to the results. The main contribution of this work is to verify if the algorithms can optimize the SUHI characterization process, analyzing the influence exerted by the studied variables. In the social sphere, the information produced can help urban planning in the construction of smart cities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Post-Graduate Program of Environment and Regional Development, University of Western São Paulo, Raposo Tavares, Km 572, SP, Presidente Prudente, 19067-175, Brazil; Post-Graduate Program of Environmental Technologies, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Av.

In this context, we evaluate historical and future associations between land use land cover changes and land surface temperature in Dera Ghazi Khan–one of the top cities in Pakistan–using multi-temporal Landsat data over two decades (2002–2022). After assessing current land use changes and future predictions, their impact on land surface temperature and urban heat island effect is measured using machine learning via Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain, Artificial Neural Network and Cellular Automata. Significant changes in land use land cover were observed in the last two decades. The built-up area expanded greatly (874 ha) while agriculture land (−687 ha) and barren land (−253 ha) show decreasing trend. The water bodies were found the lowest changes (57 ha) and vegetation cover got the largest proportion in all the years. This green-grey conversion in the last two decades (8.7%) and prospect along the main corridors show the gravity of unplanned urban growth at the cost of vegetation and agricultural land (−6.8%). The land surface temperature and urban heat island effect shows a strong positive correlation between urbanization and vegetation removal. The simulation results presented in this study confirm that by 2032, the city will face a 5° C high mean temperature based on historical patterns, which could potentially lead to more challenges associated with urban heat island if no appropriate measures are taken. It is expected that due to land cover changes by 2032, ~60% of urban and peri-urban areas will experience very hot to hot temperatures (> 31.5°C). Our results provide baseline information to urban managers and planners to understand the increasing trends of land surface temperature in response to land cover changes. The study is important for urban resource management, sustainable development policies, and actions to mitigate the heat island effect. It will further asset the broader audience to understand the impact of land use land cover changes on the land surface temperature and urban heat island effect in the light of historic pattern and machine learning approach.

This study investigates the impact of LU/LC class changes on LST based on the distribution of UHI spot maps in Mansoura city, Egypt, using Landsat satellite images from 1991 to 2021. Based on these estimated LU/LC and LST maps, machine learning algorithms, cellular automata, and artificial neural network approaches were used to predict future changes in LU/LC and LST for 2031. The influence of UHI may be quantified using the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). The geographic information system (GIS) add-in UHI calculator ArcGIS tool was created because we considered the spatial consequences of employing remote sensing data. This tool includes all the methods and procedures for calculating LST and UHI. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between LST and normalized difference built-up index and a negative correlation between LST and normalized difference vegetation index. The forecasted results for 2031 also show that the built-up area will grow roughly 20%, with a considerable drop in vegetation by 18%. If the city's fast urbanization continues, more than 40% of Mansoura will have land surface temperatures above 45°C by 2031. Avoiding dense built-up areas and growing vegetation spaces remain efficient means of minimizing the influence of UTFVI in urban construction practice. Therefore, this research will help to achieve sustainable development by providing essential insights into the complicated interplay between diverse aspects of urban settings and promoting city competency. © Geoinformatics International.","Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Badr University in Cairo (BUC), Cairo, Egypt; Public Works Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Mansoura University, Mansoura, 35516, Egypt",International Journal of Geoinformatics,10.52939/ijg.v18i6.2461,2,1,Yes,ANN,Egypt,Yes,UTFVI,LST and LULC prediction,"LST,LULC,NDVI,NDBI",Landsat 5/8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher nocturnal air temperature (Tair) is associated with adverse effects on human health, higher mortality rates, and higher energy consumption. Prediction of the spatial distribution of Tair is a step toward the 'Smart City' concept, providing an early warning system for vulnerable populations. The study of the spatial distribution of urban Tair was thus far limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources. Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring Tair continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city. In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of nocturnal Tair in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and Urban Atlas, crowdsourced Tair data, and machine learning (ML) methods. Results were tested with a 'leave-one-date-out' training scheme (testingcrowd) and reference Tair data (testingref). Three ML algorithms were compared - Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Model Averaged Neural Network. The optimal model based on accuracy and computational speed is RF, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) for testingcrowd of 1.16 Â°C (R2 = 0.512) and RMSE for testingref of 1.97 Â°C (R2 = 0.581). Overall, the most important geographic information system (GIS) predictors were morphometric parameters and albedo. The proposed method relies on open-source datasets and can, therefore, be adapted to many cities worldwide.

Each LULC type influences UHI differently with changing climate, therefore knowing this impact & connection is critical. To understand such relations, long temporal studies using remote sensing data play promising role by analysing the trend with continuity over vast area. Therefore, this study is aimed at machine learning centred spatio-temporal analysis of LST and land use indices to identify their intra-urban interaction during 1991–2021 (summer) in Imola city (specifically representing small urban environment) using Landsat-5/8 imageries. It was found that LST in 2021 increased by 38.36% from 1991, whereas average Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) increased by 43.75%, associating with increased thermal stress area evaluated using ecological evaluation index. Major LULC transformations included green area into agricultural arable-land and built-up. Finally, the modelled output shows that built-up & vegetation index have strongly impacted LST. This study, help to understand the relative impact of land-use dynamics on LST at intra-urban level specifically with respect to the small urban settings.

Case study: Greater Cairo, Egypt”",Google Earth Engine; Influencing factors; Machine learning; SAR data; Urban footprint mapping; Urban heat island,"Urban heat islands (UHI) represent one of the substantial human-induced challenges endangering urban livelihoods. UHI and climate change have significant interactions. Progressively rising warming tendencies are exacerbating higher temperatures in UHI regions. Using time-series data, we examined annual and seasonal day-night UHI intensity and its driving factors in Greater Cairo (GC), which is considered Egypt's megacity, between April 2021 and March 2022. Since Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) proposes unique horizons for mapping urban areas, we used SAR data and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm for urban footprint extraction in the search region. Sentinel-3 SLSTR thermal images were utilized to derive annual and seasonal day-night land surface temperatures (LST) during the research period. A spatio-temporal assessment of tropospheric NO2, SO2, CO, and aerosol concentrations was performed via the Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), MODIS, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) applications. The annual average UHI intensity was higher in Egypt's megacity during the nighttime (3.27 K) than during the daytime (0.50 K). This finding indicates that driving forces are boosting temperatures in urban regions at night. The seasonal average day-night UHI intensities have the highest values during the winter, followed by the summer. Significant influencing factors concerning UHI intensity varied between the daytime and nighttime. Moreover, NDBI, PV, NDVI, altitude, and wind speed were the driving factors that were influential during the day and at night. These results can be used to establish effective adaptation measures for combating the impacts of climatic change and UHI. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental Sciences Department, Faculty of Science, Damietta University, PO Box 34517, New Damietta City, Egypt",Urban Climate,10.1016/j.uclim.2023.101729,0,0,Yes,LR,Egypt,Yes,UHI,"UHI,LULC","LST
