Accordingly, a DLNN structure with 192 neurons in 3 hidden layers was proposed to construct an inference model that predicts different levels of susceptibility to flash flood. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the sigmoid were selected as the activate function and the transfer function, respectively, whereas the Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) was used to update and optimize the weights of the DLNN. A database for the study area, which includes factors of elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall, was established to train and validate the proposed model. Feature selection was carried out for these factors using the Information gain ratio. The results show that the DLNN attains a good prediction accuracy with Classification Accuracy Rate = 92.05%, Positive Predictive Value = 94.55% and Negative Predictive Value = 89.55%. Compared to benchmarks, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and Support Vector Machine, the DLNN performs better; therefore, it could be concluded that the proposed hybridization of GIS and deep learning can be a promising tool to assist the government authorities and involving parties in flash flood mitigation and land-use planning.

Due to the dynamic and complex nature of the flash flood, it is challenging to predict the sites which are vulnerable to flash floods. Therefore, earlier identification of flash flood susceptible sites can be performed using advanced machine learning models for managing flood disasters. In this study, we applied and assessed two new hybrid ensemble models, namely Dagging and Random Subspace (RS) coupled with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which are the other three state-of-the-art machine learning models for modelling flood susceptibility maps at the Teesta River basin, the northern region of Bangladesh. The application of these models includes twelve flood influencing factors with 413 current and former flooding points, which were transferred in a GIS environment. The information gain ratio, the multicollinearity diagnostics tests were employed to determine the association between the occurrences and flood influential factors. For the validation and the comparison of these models, for the ability to predict the statistical appraisal measures such as Freidman, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and t-paired tests and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) were employed. The value of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ROC was above 0.80 for all models. For flood susceptibility modelling, the Dagging model performs superior, followed by RF, the ANN, the SVM, and the RS, then the several benchmark models.

Iran has been among the most devastated regions affected by the major floods. While the temporal flash-flood forecasting models are mainly developed for warning systems, the models for assessing hazardous areas can greatly contribute to adaptation and mitigation policy-making and disaster risk reduction. Former researches in the flash-flood hazard mapping have heightened the urge for the advancement of more accurate models. Thus, the current research proposes the state-of-the-art ensemble models of boosted generalized linear model (GLMBoost) and random forest (RF), and Bayesian generalized linear model (BayesGLM) methods for higher performance modeling. Furthermore, a pre-processing method, namely simulated annealing (SA), is used to eliminate redundant variables from the modeling process. Results of the modeling based on the hit and miss analysis indicates high performance for both models (accuracy = 90â92%, Kappa = 79â84%, Success ratio = 94â96%, Threat score = 80â84%, and Heidke skill score = 79â84%). The variables of distance from the stream, vegetation, drainage density, land use, and elevation have shown more contribution among others for modeling the flash-flood. The results of this study can significantly facilitate mapping the hazardous areas and further assist watershed managers to control and remediate induced damages of flood in the data-scarce regions.

However, most existing machine learning methods for assessing flash flood risk rely on a single classifier, which is suitable for processing small sets of sample data, but the resulting prediction accuracy and generalization ability are insufficient. Meanwhile, machine learning methods that integrate multiple classifiers are thus far unknown. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an excellent algorithm for ensemble learning methods which has achieved remarkable results in many fields. It not only optimizes the algorithm but also automatically applies the CPU's multi-threading to perform parallel calculations, thus greatly improving the model training speed and prediction accuracy. Therefore, this article introduces the XGBoost model for the assessment of flash flood risk, and then combines the two input strategies and the Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model to verify its optimal effect, thus proposing the XGBoost-based method for flash flood risk assessment. Subsequently, an attribution analysis was implemented to assess the possible errors of this approach; and finally, a county-level flash flood risk map for Yunnan Province, China, was generated based on the proposed method. The results demonstrate that: (1) XGBoost performs well, with an accuracy of 0.84 in the testing period, and its five indices (precision, recall, accuracy, kappa, and F-score) are all higher than those of LSSVM. (2) The XGBoost-based approach provided the reliable flash flood risk maps, which were validated by another flash flood inventory, although some errors may be attributed to critical environmental factors and statistical disaster location accuracy. (3) The high-risk counties (including high-risk and highest-risk) accounted for 40.3%, with the highest-risk counties mainly concentrated in southeastern Yunnan. This article further addresses the limitations of XGBoost (e.g., as a time-consuming greedy algorithm, the non-necessity of multi-threaded optimization). All of the above results indicate that the XGBoost-based method is an effective method for obtaining high-quality county-level flash flood risk maps, which contributes to the theoretical basis for ongoing county-level flash flood prevention in China.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126382,86,29,Yes,"Peoples R China,England","XGB,SVM",Yes,Yunnan province - 390000 km 2,Flash flood inventory from China Water Resources Department  (2011-2015) and  the China Meteorological Department Statistics (2018–2019).,"Binary points

We identified flood-prone areas using data from Sentinel-1 sensor. We then selected 10 conditioning factors to spatially predict floods and assess their predictive power using the Relief Attribute Evaluation (RFAE) method. Model validation was performed using two statistical error indices and the area under the curve (AUC). Our results show that the Bagging-Cubic-KNN ensemble model outperformed other ensemble models. It decreased the overfitting and variance problems in the training dataset and enhanced the prediction accuracy of the Cubic-KNN model (AUC=0.660).

RS and BT algorithms provided 10 runs of data resampling for learning and validation of the models. Then the mean of 10 runs of predictions is used to produce the flood susceptibility maps (FSM).

Results demonstrated that resampling algorithms improved the performance of Standalone GAM, MARS and BRT models.

The predictive capability of predictors is evaluated through the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) method. As expected, the slope angle results in the factor with the highest predictive capability. The application of the AHP model implies the construction of ten pair-wise comparison matrices for calculating the normalized weights of each flash-flood predictor. The computed weights are used as input data in kNN-AHP and KS-AHP ensemble models for calculating the Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI). The FFPI also is determined through kNN and KS stand-alone models. The performance of the models is evaluated using statistical metrics (i.e., sensitivity, specificity and accuracy) while the validation of the results is done by constructing the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) values and by calculating the density of torrential pixels within FFPI classes. Overall, the best performance is obtained by the kNN-AHP ensemble model.

Lai Chau, a province in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam was chosen as a case study since it had recently undergone severe flashflood in 2018. For this purpose, numerical predictor variables such as topographically derived factors (Digital Elevation Model, Aspect, Slope, Curvature, Topographic Wetness Index), climatic variables (Rain), and hydrological variables (stream density, stream power index, distance to river) and multiple remote sensing indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Buildup Index) were used. These predictor variables were selected because they are globally collectible and reproducible. The performances of these models were evaluated by using common statistical indicators, namely Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Overall Accuracy and Area under Receiving Operating Characteristics, and the statistical test of differences. The results showed that the proposed swarm intelligence models outperformed benchmarked methods, namely Particle Swarm Optimization, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest in almost all comparing indicators.

Hence, identifying the susceptible areas to flood is an important task for every country to prevent such dangerous consequences. The present study developed a framework for identifying flood-prone areas of the Top?a river basin, Slovakia using geographic information system (GIS), multi-criteria decision making approach (MCDMA), bivariate statistics (Frequency Ratio (FR), Statistical Index (SI)) and machine learning (NaÃ¯ve Bayes Tree (NBT), Logistic Regression (LR)). To reach such a goal, different physical-geographical factors (criteria) were integrated and mapped. To access the relationship and interdependences among the criteria, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP) were used. Based on the expertsâ decisions, the DEMATEL-ANP model was used to compute the relative weights of different criteria and a GIS-based linear combination was performed to derive the susceptibility index. Separately, the flood susceptibility index computation through NBT-FR and NBT-SI hybrid models assumed, in the first stage, the estimation of the weight of each class/category of conditioning factor through SI and FR and the integration of these values in NBT algorithm. The application of LR stand-alone required the calculation of the weights of conditioning factors by analysing their spatial relation with the location of the historical flood events. The study revealed that very high and high flood susceptibility classes covered between 20% and 47% of the study area, respectively. The validation of results, using the past flood points, highlighted that the hybrid DEMATEL-ANP model was the most performant with an Area Under ROC curve higher than 0.97, an accuracy of 0.922 and a value of HSS of 0.844. The presented methodological approach used for the identification of flood susceptible areas can serve as an alternative for the updating of preliminary flood risk assessment based on the EU Floods Directive.

At first, we construct maps depicting the most effective factors on floods (12 factors), forest fires (10 factors), and landslides (10 factors), and used the Boruta algorithm to prioritize the impact of each respective factor on the occurrence of each hazard. Subsequently, flood, landslides, and forest fire susceptibility maps prepared using a Random Forest (RF) model in the R statistical software. Results indicate that 42.83% of the study area are not susceptible to any hazards, while 2.67% of the area is at risk of all three hazards. The results of the multi-hazard map in Shiraz City indicate that 25% of Shiraz city is very susceptible to flooding, while 16% is very susceptible to landslide occurrences. For four strategic watersheds, it is notable that in the Dorodzan Watershed, landslides and floods are the most important hazards; whereas, flood occurrences cover the largest area of the Maharlou Watershed. In contrast, the Tashk-Bakhtegan Watershed is so sensible to floods and landslides, respectively. Finally, in the Ghareaghaj Watershed, forest fire ranks as the strongest hazard, followed by floods. The validation results indicate an AUC of 0.834, 0.939, and 0.943 for the flood, landslide, and forest fire susceptibility maps, respectively. Also, other accuracy measures including, specificity, sensitivity, TSS, CCI, and Gini coefficient confirmed results of the AUC values. These results allow us to forecast the spatial behavior of such multi-hazard events, and researchers and stakeholders alike can apply them to evaluate hazards under various mitigation scenarios.

Identification of probable flash flood locations and development of accurate flash flood susceptibility maps are important for proper flash flood management of a region. With this objective, we proposed and compared several novel hybrid computational approaches of machine learning methods for flash flood susceptibility mapping, namely AdaBoostM1 based Credal Decision Tree (ABM-CDT); Bagging based Credal Decision Tree (Bag-CDT); Dagging based Credal Decision Tree (Dag-CDT); MultiBoostAB based Credal Decision Tree (MBAB-CDT), and single Credal Decision Tree (CDT). These models were applied at a catchment of Markazi state in Iran. About 320 past flash flood events and nine flash flood influencing factors, namely distance from rivers, aspect, elevation, slope, rainfall, distance from faults, soil, land use, and lithology were considered and analyzed for the development of flash flood susceptibility maps. Correlation based feature selection method was used to validate and select the important factors for modeling of flash floods. Based on this feature selection analysis, only eight factors (distance from rivers, aspect, elevation, slope, rainfall, soil, land use, and lithology) were selected for the modeling, where distance to rivers is the most important factor for modeling of flash flood in this area. Performance of the models was validated and compared by using several robust metrics such as statistical measures and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) curve. The results of this study suggested that ABM-CDT (AUC = 0.957) has the best predictive capability in terms of accuracy, followed by Dag-CDT (AUC = 0.947), MBAB-CDT (AUC = 0.933), Bag-CDT (AUC = 0.932), and CDT (0.900), respectively.

The Komijan watershed of Markazi Province, Iran is often affected by floods that have caused great material damage and loss of life. The main objective of this study is to use a new machine-learning method to create three models: best-first decision tree (BFT), a bagging best-first decision tree (BBFT) ensemble and a dagging best-first decision tree (DBFT) ensemble to spatially predict flood probability. Twelve conditioning-factor measures for 272 locations of past floods were used to train and test three models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity (SST), specificity (SPF), accuracy (ACC), kappa (K), and root mean square error (RMSE) are applied to compare and validate the models. The results are that all three models performed well in mapping, flood probabilities (AUC > 0.904). The BBFT model was best, however, with an AUC = 0.96. Based on the results of the Relief-F attribute evaluation method, two soil and slope factors were weighted highest among the parameters, indicating that they are the most important flood-conditioning factors. These models may improve identification of zones that are most susceptible to flooding, improving the capacity for risk management and providing more detailed information for managers and decision-makers.

Consequently, people have been experiencing tremendous damage to properties, infrastructures, and human casualties. Usually, floods are one of the devastating disasters from nature, but for developing nations like Bangladesh, flooding becomes worse. Due to the dynamic and complex nature of the flooding, the prediction of flooding sites was usually very difficult for flood management. But the artificial intelligence and advanced remote sensing techniques together could predict and identify the possible sites, which are vulnerable to flooding. The present work aimed to predict and identify the flooding sites or flood susceptible zones in the Teesta River basin by employing state-of-the-art novel ensemble machine learning algorithms. We developed ensembles of bagging with REPtree, random forest (RF), M5P, and random tree (RT) algorithms for obtaining reliable and highly accurate results. Twelve factors, which are considered as the conditioning factors, and 413 current and former flooding points were identified for flooding susceptibility modelling. The Information Gain ratio statistical technique was utilized to determine the influence of the factors for flooding. We applied receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for validation of the flood susceptible models. The Freidman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, KruskalâWallis test and KolmogorovâSmirnov test were applied together for the first time in flood susceptibility modelling to compare the models with each other. Results showed that more than 800Â km2 area was predicted as the very high flood susceptibility zones by all algorithms. The ROC curve showed that all models achieved more than 0.85 area under the curve indicating highly accurate flood models. For flood susceptibility modelling, the bagging with M5P performed superior, followed by bagging with RF, bagging with REPtree and bagging with RT. The methodology and solution-oriented results presented in this paper will assist the regional as well as local authorities and the policy-makers for mitigating the risks related to floods and also help in developing appropriate measures to avoid potential damages.

The present research work was done through preparation of a sophisticated flood inventory map; eight flood conditioning variables were selected based on the topography and hydro-climatological condition, and by applying the novel ensemble approach of hyperpipes (HP) and support vector regression (SVR) machine learning (ML) algorithms. The ensemble approach of HP-SVR was also compared with the stand-alone ML algorithms of HP and SVR.

The design of flood susceptibility maps has been enhanced through use of hybrid machine learning and deep learning models. Although these models have achieved better accuracy than traditional models, they are not widely used by stakeholders due to their black-box nature. In this study, we propose the application of an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model that incorporates the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) model to interpret the outcomes of convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models, and analyze the impact of variables on flood susceptibility mapping. This study was conducted in Jinju Province, South Korea, which has a long history of flood events. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), which showed a prediction accuracy of 88.4%. SHAP plots showed that land use and various soil attributes significantly affected flood susceptibility in the study area. In light of these findings, we recommend the use of XAI-based models in future flood susceptibility mapping studies to improve interpretations of model outcomes, and build trust among stakeholders during the flood-related decision-making process.

Now, flood susceptibility modelling based on data driven model is state-of-the-art method such as ensemble learning and deep learning. However, the effect of deep learning coupling with ensemble learning models in flood susceptibility modelling is still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose three deep learning coupling with ensemble learning models by combining the deep learning (DL) with Filtered Classifier (FC), Rotation forest (RF) and Random Subspace (RSS) and explore the effect of coupling method for modelling flood susceptibility. The key step of this paper is as following: firstly, a Dingnan County which is lied in the Jiangxi Province of China is chosen as a case study, single flood event point and random sampling method was applied to generate the flood and non-flood data, respectively, then frequency ratio was utilized to analyze the relationship between each influencing factor and flood occurrence, based on the value of VIF, Spearman's correlation and One R classifier, the result show that there is no multicollinearity between each influencing factor, ten influencing factors have contribution to the flood occurrence and all of them are applied to construct the coupling model. Finally, the DL, FC-DL, RF-DL and RSS-DL were applied to produce flood susceptibility maps. Then, several statistical indexes such as area under the curve (AUC), Kappa index, accuracy (ACC), and F-measure were used to assess the accomplishment of these coupling models. For the train data, the FC-DL model acquired the highest AUC value (0.996), followed by RF-DL (0.944), RSS-DL (0.934), and DL (0.934). For the validation data, the result showed that all models have a good accomplishment (AUC>0.8). In a word, the deep learning coupling with ensemble learning models demonstrates the more reliable and excellent performance. Hence, the proposed new method will help the government for land use planning and can be applied in other area around the world.

Also, there is an evident increase of the size of the damages caused by these hazards. BÃ¢sca Chiojdului River Basin is one of the most affected areas in Romania by flash-flood phenomena. Therefore, Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI) was defined and calculated across the BÃ¢sca Chiojdului river basin by using one bivariate statistical method (Statistical Index) and its novel ensemble with the following machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Classification and Regression Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree CART. In a first stage, the areas with torrentiality were digitized based on orthophotomaps and field observations. These regions, together with an equal number of non-torrential pixels, were further divided into training surfaces (70%) and validating surfaces (30%). The next step of the analysis consisted of the selection of flash-flood conditioning factors based on the multicollinearity investigation and predictive ability estimation through Information Gain method. Eight factors, from a total of ten flash-floods predictors, were selected in order to be included in the FFPI calculation process. By applying the models represented by Statistical Index and its ensemble with the machine learning algorithms, the weight of each conditioning factor and of each factor class/category in the FFPI equations was established. Once the weight values were derived, the FFPI values across the BÃ¢sca Chiojdului river basin were calculated by overlaying the flash-flood predictors in GIS environment. According to the results obtained, the central part of BÃ¢sca Chiojdului river basin has the highest susceptibility to flash-flood phenomena. Thus, around 30% of the study site has high and very high values of FFPI. The results validation was carried out by applying the Prediction Rate and Success Rate. The methods revealed the fact that the Multilayer Perceptron â Statistical Index (MLP-SI) ensemble has the highest efficiency among the 3 methods.

Identifying areas prone to flash flooding is a crucial step in flash flood hazard management. In the present study, the Kalvan watershed in Markazi Province, Iran, was chosen to evaluate the flash flood susceptibility modeling. Thus, to detect flash flood-prone zones in this study area, five machine learning (ML) algorithms were tested. These included boosted regression tree (BRT), random forest (RF), parallel random forest (PRF), regularized random forest (RRF), and extremely randomized trees (ERT). Fifteen climatic and geo-environmental variables were used as inputs of the flash flood susceptibility models. The results showed that ERT was the most optimal model with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.82. The rest of the modelsâ AUC values, i.e., RRF, PRF, RF, and BRT, were 0.80, 0.79, 0.78, and 0.75, respectively. In the ERT model, the areal coverage for very high to moderate flash flood susceptible area was 582.56 km2 (28.33%), and the rest of the portion was associated with very low to low susceptibility zones. It is concluded that topographical and hydrological parameters, e.g., altitude, slope, rainfall, and the riverâs distance, were the most effective parameters. The results of this study will play a vital role in the planning and implementation of flood mitigation strategies in the region. Â© 2020 by the authors.

In the present paper, new modeling approaches, Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) integrated with IOE (ADT-IOE) and ADT integrated with AHP (ADT-AHP), were proposed for flash-flood susceptibility mapping across the Suha river catchment (Romania). Besides, two stand-alone methods, Index of Entropy (IOE) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), were also investigated. For this regard, 111 torrential points and 111 non-torrential points along with 8 flash-flood conditioning factors have been involved in the training process of the four models. The quality of the flash-flood models was checked by using the ROC Curve method, classification accuracy (CLA), and Kappa index.

This part of the Ganga floodplain region, which under the influence of undergoing active tectonic regime related subsidence, is the hotbed of annual flood disaster. This makes the region one of the best natural laboratories to test the flood susceptibility models for establishing a universalization of such models in low relief highly flood prone areas. Based on highly sophisticated flood inventory archived for this region, and 12 flood conditioning factors viz. annual rainfall, soil type, stream density, distance from stream, distance from road, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), altitude, slope aspect, slope, curvature, land use/land cover, and geomorphology, an advanced novel hybrid model Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and three metaheuristic models-based ensembles with ANFIS namely ANFIS-GA (Genetic Algorithm), ANFIS-DE (Differential Evolution), and ANFIS-PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), have been applied for zonation of the flood susceptible areas. The flood inventory dataset, prepared by collected flood samples, were apportioned into 70:30 classes to prepare training and validation datasets. One independent validation method, the Area-Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) Curve, and other 11 cut-off-dependent model evaluation metrices have helped to conclude that the ANIFS-GA has outperformed other three models with highest success rate AUC = 0.922 and prediction rate AUC = 0.924. The accuracy was also found to be highest for ANFIS-GA during training (0.886) & validation (0.883). Better performance of ANIFS-GA than the individual models as well as some ensemble models suggests and warrants further study in this topoclimatic environment using other classes of susceptibility models. This will further help establishing a benchmark model with capability of highest accuracy and sensitivity performance in the similar topographic and climatic setting taking assumption of the quality of input parameters as constant.

However, there is a great need to examine hazards holistically to better manage the complex of threats found in any region. Many regions of the world have complex hazard landscapes wherein risk from individual and/or multiple extreme events is omnipresent. Extensive parts of Iran experience a complex array of natural hazards â floods, earthquakes, landslides, forest fires, subsidence, and drought. The effectiveness of risk mitigation is in part a function of whether the complex of hazards can be collectively considered, visualized, and evaluated. This study develops and tests individual and collective multi-hazard risk maps for floods, landslides, and forest fires to visualize the spatial distribution of risk in Fars Province, southern Iran. To do this, two well-known machine-learning algorithms â SVM and MARS â are used to predict the distribution of these events. Past floods, landslides, and forest fires were surveyed and mapped. The locations of occurrence of these events (individually and collectively) were randomly separated into training (70%) and testing (30%) data sets. The conditioning factors (for floods, landslides, and forest fires) employed to model the risk distributions are aspect, elevation, drainage density, distance from faults, geology, LULC, profile curvature, annual mean rainfall, plan curvature, distance from man-made residential structures, distance from nearest river, distance from nearest road, slope gradient, soil types, mean annual temperature, and TWI. The outputs of the two models were assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, true-skill statistics (TSS), and the correlation and deviance values from each models for each hazard. The areas-under-the-curves (AUC) for the MARS model prediction were 76.0%, 91.2%, and 90.1% for floods, landslides, and forest fires, respectively. Similarly, the AUCs for the SVM model were 75.5%, 89.0%, and 91.5%. The TSS reveals that the MARS model was better able to predict landslide risk, but was less able to predict flood-risk patterns and forest-fire risk. Finally, the combination of flood, forest fire, and landslide risk maps yielded a multi-hazard susceptibility map for the province. The better predictive model indicated that 52.3% of the province was at-risk for at least one of these hazards. This multi-hazard map may yield valuable insight for land-use planning, sustainable development of infrastructure, and also integrated watershed management in Fars Province.

In this study, we used four machine-learning methods, namely Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), Radial Basis Function Classifier (RBFC), Multinomial Naive Bayes (NBM), and Logistic Model Tree (LMT) to generate flash flood susceptibility maps at the minor part of Nghe An province of the Center region (Vietnam) where recurrent flood problems are being experienced. Performance of these four methods was evaluated to select the best method for flash flood susceptibility mapping. In the model studies, ten flash flood conditioning factors, namely soil, slope, curvature, river density, flow direction, distance from rivers, elevation, aspect, land use, and geology, were chosen based on topography and geo-environmental conditions of the site. For the validation of models, the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), Area Under Curve (AUC), and various statistical indices were used. The results indicated that performance of LMT model is the best among the four methods (LMT: AUC = 0.988; KLR: AUC = 0.985; RBFC: AUC = 0.984; and NBM: AUC = 0.983).

Three novel intelligence approaches, namely, baggingâfunctional tree (BFT), daggingâfunctional tree, and rotational forestâfunctional tree are used for modelling, with consideration to 15 flood conditioning factors (FCFs) as independent variables and 426 flood locations as dependent variables. Three threshold-dependent and -independent approaches are used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit and prediction capability of the ensemble models with a single functional tree (FT). These approaches include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the success rate curve (SRC) and prediction rate curve (PRC), efficiency (E) and true skill statistics (TSS). The random forest model is used to determine the relative importance of FCFs. Elevation, stream distance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) have crucial roles in the study area during flash flood occurrences. According to the results of all threshold-dependent and -independent approaches (AUC of SRC = 0.933, AUC of PRC = 0.959, E = 0.76 and TSS = 0.72), the BFT ensemble model has the greatest accuracy in terms of modelling FFS. Results also show that the performance of the FT model is enhanced by three meta-classifiers. The seed cell area index technique is also used to check model classification accuracy and reliability. Results of this technique show that all the models demonstrate good performance and reliability. However, the FFS maps prepared by machine learning ensemble techniques have excellent accuracy and reliability, as per the results of validation methods. Thus, these FFS maps can be used as a convenient tool to reduce the effect of flood in flash flood-prone areas.

In this study, we propose a local spatial sequential long short-term memory neural network (LSS-LSTM) for flood susceptibility prediction in Shangyou County, China. The three main contributions of this study are summarized below. First of all, it is a new perspective to use the deep learning technique of LSTM for flood susceptibility prediction. Second, we integrate an appropriate feature engineering method with LSTM to predict flood susceptibility. Third, we implement two optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization to further improve the performance of the proposed method. The LSS-LSTM method can not only capture the attribution information of flood conditioning factors and the local spatial information of flood data, but also has powerful sequential modelling capabilities to deal with the spatial relationship of floods.

To do this, land use changes over the next 20 years (2019â2040) were predicted from land use changes of the past 29 years (1990â2019) using the land change modeler (LCM) method. Future climate change was projected for the next 20 years (2020â2040) based on climate data from 1990 to 2015 using Lars-WG software and two scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Twelve factors that influence flooding and 262 locations of past floods were used to model the spatial pattern of flood susceptibility in the watershed. A random forest (RF) model and a Bayesian generalized linear model (GLMbayes) were used to predict areas susceptible to flooding. The results showed that elevation (21.55), distance from river (15.28), land use (11.1), slope (10.58), and rainfall (6.8) are the most important factors affecting flooding in this basin. The factors were modified according to land use changes and climate changes and the models were revised. The land use and climate forecasting in this region indicate that land use change, like decreased forest cover (?77.19 km2) and reduced rangeland (?218.83 km2) near rivers and downstream, can be expected and rainfall is projected to increase (under from both scenarios). These changes would result in increased probabilities of flooding in the downstream portion of the watershed and near the sea. The area-under-the-curve evaluation of the models indicates that the RF model more accurately predicted flood probability (0.91) than did the GLMbayes model (0.847).

These disasters are believed to be associated with land use changes and climate variability. However, identifying the factors that lead to flooding is challenging. This study mapped flood susceptibility in the northeast region of Bangladesh using Bayesian regularization back propagation (BRBP) neural network, classification and regression trees (CART), a statistical model (STM) using the evidence belief function (EBF), and their ensemble models (EMs) for three time periods (2000, 2014, and 2017). The accuracy of machine learning algorithms (MLAs), STM, and EMs were assessed by considering the area under the curveâreceiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC). Evaluation of the accuracy levels of the aforementioned algorithms revealed that EM4 (BRBP-CART-EBF) outperformed (AUC > 90%) standalone and other ensemble models for the three time periods analyzed. Furthermore, this study investigated the relationships among land cover change (LCC), population growth (PG), road density (RD), and relative change of flooding (RCF) areas for the period between 2000 and 2017. The results showed that areas with very high susceptibility to flooding increased by 19.72% between 2000 and 2017, while the PG rate increased by 51.68% over the same period. The Pearson correlation coefficient for RCF and RD was calculated to be 0.496. These findings highlight the significant association between floods and causative factors.

Therefore, it is crucial to develop accurate flood risk assessment maps. In this study, we proposed a flood risk assessment framework which combines flood susceptibility assessment and flood consequences (human health and financial impact) for developing a final flood risk assessment map using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. Two hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, namely ABMDT (AdaBoost-DT) and BDT (Bagging-DT) were developed with Decision Table (DT) as a base classifier for creating a flood susceptibility map. We used 847 flood locations of major flooding events in the years 2007, 2009 and 2013 in Quang Nam province of Vietnam; and 14 flood influencing factors of topography, geology, hydrology and environment to construct and validate the hybrid AI models. Various statistical measures were used to validate the models, including the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve called AUC. Results show that all the proposed models performed well, but the performance of the BDT model (AUC = 0.96) is the best in comparison to other models ABMDT (AUC = 0.953) and single DT (AUC = 0.929). Therefore, the flood susceptibility map produced by the BDT model was used to combine with a flood consequences map to develop a reliable flood risk assessment map for the study area. The final flood risk map can provide a useful source for better flood hazard management of the study area, and the proposed framework and models can be applied to other flood-prone areas.

Identification of flood susceptibility areas has been performed by applying advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) at the lower part of Raidak river basin. The flood susceptibility maps have been generated based on 14 different flood conditioning factors. Models are evaluated in a conventional way using ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve. The AUC value of ROC is above 0.80 for all models and XGBoost depicts the highest efficacy (AUC â= â0.92). Friedman test and Wilcoxon Signed rank test have been used to measure the statistical variances among the applied models. Models proficiently show that the upper part of Raidak river basin is a less flood probable region whereas the eastern and some middle parts have high flood probability. Around 27% area (285.39 sq.km) within the river basin is highly flood prone (based on XGBoost model) due to the fast changing dynamic landscape and large scale human intervention.

Dependent variables were divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) for flood susceptibility modeling. The Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), Kappa index, accuracy, and other statistical criteria were used to evaluate the models' accuracy. The results showed that resolving the DEM alone cannot significantly affect the accuracy of flood probability prediction regardless of the applied MLM and independently of the statistical model used to assess the performance accuracy. In contrast, the factors such as altitude, precipitation, and distance from the river have a considerable impact on floods in this region. Also, the evaluation results of the models showed that the RF (AUC12.5,30m = 0.983, 0.975) model is more accurate in preparing the FPM than the ANN (AUC12.5,30m = 0.949, 0.93) and GLM (AUC12.5,30m = 0.965, 0.949) models. This study's solution-oriented findings might help water managers and decision-makers to make the most effective adaptation and mitigation measures against potential flooding.

As a result, Flood Susceptibility Maps (FSMs) became vital for flood prevention, risk mitigation, and decision-making. The purpose of this study is to develop FSMs for Adana province on the Mediterranean coast of TÃ¼rkiye using tree-based machine learning (ML) classifiers. This study seeks to analyze the predictive performance of Natural Gradient Boosting Machines (NGBoost) for the first time in FSM studies, as well as the first comparative study of Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM) and CatBoost versus other techniques, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost). These ML approaches were evaluated using fourteen flood conditioning parameters divided into five categories: topographical, meteorological, vegetation, lithological, and anthropogenic. The AdaBoost and LightGBM models scored the highest in terms of test accuracy (0.8978), followed by GB and NGBoost (0.8832), XGBoost (0.8759), RF (0.8613), and CatBoost (0.8102). A McNemar's test was used to determine the statistical significance of classifier predictions. According to the FSMs generated, Adana province has a substantial quantity of land that is moderately to extremely prone to flooding. For feature selection, the majority of previous studies used solely the Information Gain (IG) method and multicollinearity analysis. However, only a few studies used global explanatory models to calculate the relevance of their conditioning factors. A locally explained model is required to understand the associations and dependencies between each conditioning factor. Therefore, this study locally explains the generated ML-based FSMs with the help of an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach, namely SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). According to the findings, elevation, slope, and distance to rivers are the top three contributing factors in most models. SHAP results show that lower elevations, lower slopes, areas closer to river banks, agricultural areas, and sparsely vegetated areas are shown to be more prone to flooding.

To this end, this study evaluated the flood susceptibility using a neural network model depending on a flood inundation map created from satellite data from 2010 to 2020, and explanatory factors for flood inundation selected by Geodetector and regularized random forest. Subsequently, the landscape pattern of the coastal city was quantified based on the land cover, and key landscape pattern metrics for flood susceptibility were selected at patch and class levels using statistical approaches. Eventually, urban spatial planning strategies for flood management were proposed based on the ecological significance of key metrics. Taking Xiamen as a case study, the flood susceptibility map showed that flood-prone areas in Xiamen are mainly distributed along river banks and coastlines. Key landscape pattern metrics for flood susceptibility selected by statistical approaches showed that patch-level metrics account for more explanatory power than class-level metrics, and the classes of the landscape would affect the role of patch-level metrics. Overall, the division index of the forest, the connectance index of water, the number of core areas and the fractal dimension index of urban, and the Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance of urban and water are significantly positively related to flood susceptibility, while the core area and the proximity index of urban, the similarity index, the core area index, and the edge contrast index of the forest, and the contiguity index of forest, grass, farmland, and shrub negatively related with flood susceptibility. Based on these findings, intensive urban planning and integrative Nature-based Solutions networks should be considered as strategies for enhancing coastal flood resilience.

It is interesting to see whether RNB could optimize NB and achieve satisfied assessment results like RF in the flood susceptibility assessment study. RNB has rarely been used in study of using machine learning methods to spatially analyze natural disasters, and thus it was selected as the analysis method. Based on the data feasibility, 12 spatial factors that affect the occurrence and spatial distribution of floods were selected. To avoid the influence of subjective equal-interval classification method, natural breaks and quantile method were used to discretize factors with continuous values, respectively. Here, a recently proposed repeatedly random sampling method was adopted to select negative samples for RNB to generate a most accurate classifier (MAC) that was employed to compute the probability of flood occurrence in the study area. Consequently, this paper adopted the integrated framework of GIS and RNB to spatially assess the flood susceptibility using the Wanan County in China as an instance. The results demonstrated that when integrated with the repeatedly random sampling method, the MAC-based flood susceptibility maps corresponding to different factor discretization methods were similar, meaning this framework can effectively avoid the effects caused by different factor discretization methods. Also, to testify the classification performance of RNB, RF and NB were chosen to compare the classification performance with it. The results indicated the classification performance in the order of RF > RNB > NB. This means RNB is able to achieve better classification performance than NB, but it exists limitations when compared with traditional strong classifiers like RF. The findings of this paper proved that RNB is a feasible approach for natural hazard susceptibility assessment.

In this study, a flood risk map was produced for Kermanshah city (Iran) by combining flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. Based on effective factors of urban flooding, flood hazard maps were generated using two machine learning models: Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP). These models were developed on 117 flood sites which were identified on the reports and field surveys for Kermanshah city, and 163 non-flooded points. Economic, social, and infrastructure criteria were considered to analyze flood vulnerability. The sub-criteria were defined based on social and cultural structure in developing countries and urban infrastructure facilities involved in the floods. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process method (FAHP) was applied to determine the overall weight vector. The results demonstrated that the MaxEnt model had a better performance than the GARP model based on two common indices which are the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC = 96.76â98.32%) and kappa statistic (Kappa = 0.82-0.86). These findings showed that machine learning models provide reliable results for areas where data access is challenging, especially in developing countries. The results also indicated that infrastructure criterion has the highest impact weight on the vulnerability. In general, population, urban texture, and distance to the major drainage channels are the most important factors in increasing flood risk. Also, the vulnerability of an urban neighborhood greatly increases the risk of flooding.

Twenty flood-risk factors were selected to model flood risk using several machine learning techniques: conditional inference random forest (CIRF), the gradient boosting model (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and their ensembles. To investigate the future (year 2050) effects of changing climates and changing land use on future flood risk, a general circulation model (GCM) with representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of the 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios by 2050 was tested for impacts on 8 precipitation variables. In addition, future land uses in 2050 was prepared using a CA-Markov model. The performances of the flood risk models were validated with Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) and other statistical analyses. The AUC value of the ROC curve indicates that the ensemble model had the highest predictive power (AUC = 0.83) and was followed by GBM (AUC = 0.80), XGB (AUC = 0.79), and CIRF (AUC = 0.78). The results of climate and land use changes on future flood-prone areas showed that the areas classified as having moderate to very high flood risk will increase by 2050. Due to the changes occurring with land uses and in climates, the area classified as moderate to very high risk increased in the predictions from all four models. The areal proportion classes of the risk zones in 2050 under the RCP 2.6 scenario using the ensemble model have changed of the following proportions from the current distribution Very Low = ?12.04 %, Low = ?8.56 %, Moderate = +1.56 %, High = +11.55 %, and Very High = +7.49 %.

This study describes the potential application of two architectures of deep learning neural networks, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), for spatially explicit prediction and mapping of flash flood probability. To develop and validate the predictive models, a geospatial database that contained records for the historical flood events and geo-environmental characteristics of the Golestan Province in northern Iran was constructed. The step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) was employed to investigate the spatial interplay between floods and different influencing factors. The CNN and RNN models were trained using the SWARA weights and validated using the receiver operating characteristics technique. The results showed that the CNN model (AUC = 0.832, RMSE = 0.144) performed slightly better than the RNN model (AUC = 0.814, RMSE = 0.181) in predicting future floods. Further, these models demonstrated an improved prediction of floods compared to previous studies that used different models in the same study area. This study showed that the spatially explicit deep learning neural network models are successful in capturing the heterogeneity of spatial patterns of flood probability in the Golestan Province, and the resulting probability maps can be used for the development of mitigation plans in response to the future floods. The general policy implication of our study suggests that design, implementation, and verification of flood early warning systems should be directed to approximately 40% of the land area characterized by high and very susceptibility to flooding.

Our work aims to propose a state-of-the-art model for susceptibility mapping of the flash flood using the decision tree random subspace ensemble optimized by hybrid firefly-particle swarm optimization (HFPS), namely the HFPS-RSTree model. In this work, we used data from a flood inventory map consisting of 1866 polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and a field survey conducted in the northwest mountainous area of the Van Ban district, Lao Cai Province in Vietnam. A total of eleven flooding conditioning factors (soil type, geology, rainfall, river density, elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), plant curvature, and profile curvature) were used as explanatory variables. These indicators were compiled from a geological and mineral resources map, soil type map, and topographic map, ALOS PALSAR DEM 30 m, and Landsat-8 imagery. The HFPS-RSTree model was trained and verified using the inventory map and the eleven conditioning variables and then compared with four machine learning algorithms, i.e., the support vector machine (SVM), the random forests (RF), the C4.5 decision trees (C4.5 DT), and the logistic model trees (LMT) models. We employed a range of statistical standard metrics to assess the predictive performance of the proposed model. The results show that the HFPS-RSTree model had the best predictive performance and achieved better results than those of other benchmarks with the ability to predict flash flood, reaching an overall accuracy of over 90%. It can be concluded that the proposed approach provides new insights into flash flood prediction in mountainous regions.

Environmental and water management in many countries require modeling of flood susceptibility to help in reducing the damages and impact of floods. The objective of the current work is to employ four data mining/machine learning models to generate flood susceptibility maps, namely boosted regression tree (BRT), functional data analysis (FDA), general linear model (GLM), and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA). This study was done in Wadi Qena Basin in Egypt. Flood inundated locations were determined and extracted from the interpretation of different datasets, including high-resolution satellite images (sentinel-2 and Astro digital) (after flood events), historical records, and intensive field works. In total, 342 flood inundated locations were mapped using ArcGIS 10.5, which separated into two groups; training (has 239 flood locations represents 70%) and validating (has 103 flood locations represents 30%), respectively. Nine themes of flood-influencing factors were prepared, including slope-angle, slope length, altitude, distance from main wadis, landuse/landcover, lithological units, curvature, slope-aspect, and topographic wetness index. The relationships between the flood-influencing factors and the flood inventory map were evaluated using the mentioned models (BRT, FDA, GLM, and MDA). The results were compared with flood inundating locations (validating flood sites), which were not used in constructing the models. The accuracy of the models was calculated through the success (training data) and prediction (validation data) rate curves according to the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). The results showed that the AUC for success and prediction rates are 0.783, 0.958, 0.816, 0.821 and 0.812, 0.856, 0.862, 0.769 for BRT, FDA, GLM, and MDA models, respectively. Subsequently, flood susceptibility maps were divided into five classes, including very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The results revealed that the BRT, FDA, GLM, and MDA models provide reasonable accuracy in flood susceptibility mapping. The produced susceptibility maps might be vitally important for future development activities in the area, especially in choosing new urban areas, infrastructural activities, and flood mitigation areas.

A total of 2769 records were collected from flood locations across the entire country; we divided this data set into two groups using a cross-validation technique. The first group, used as a training data set, was constructed from 70% of the data set and was used for model building. The second group, used as a testing data set, was constructed from the remaining 30% of the records and used for validation. Ten flood conditioning factors, slope, altitude, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, rainfall, geology, land use, distance from roads, and distance from rivers, were identified and used in the modeling process. The area under the prediction-rate curve was used for model evaluation, with results showing that the flood susceptibility map has an acceptable accuracy of 75%. The results also indicated that approximately 12% and 3% of the country are highly and very highly susceptible to future flooding events, respectively. Moreover, 29% and 49% of Iran's cities are located in areas with high and very high susceptibility to future flooding hazards.

Reducing the outputs obtained after each modelling analysis is key to present the results for stakeholders, land managers and policymakers. So, the main goal of this survey was to present a method to synthesize three natural hazards in one multi-hazard map and its evaluation for hazard management and land use planning. To test this methodology, we took as study area the Gorganrood Watershed, located in the Golestan Province (Iran). First, an inventory map of three different types of hazards including flood, landslides, and gullies was prepared using field surveys and different official reports. To generate the susceptibility maps, a total of 17 geo-environmental factors were selected as predictors using the MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) machine learning technique. The accuracy of the predictive models was evaluated by drawing receiver operating characteristic-ROC curves and calculating the area under the ROC curve-AUCROC. The MaxEnt model not only implemented superbly in the degree of fitting, but also obtained significant results in predictive performance. Variables importance of the three studied types of hazards showed that river density, distance from streams, and elevation were the most important factors for flood, respectively. Lithological units, elevation, and annual mean rainfall were relevant for detecting landslides. On the other hand, annual mean rainfall, elevation, and lithological units were used for gully erosion mapping in this study area. Finally, by combining the flood, landslides, and gully erosion susceptibility maps, an integrated multi-hazard map was created. The results demonstrated that 60% of the area is subjected to hazards, reaching a proportion of landslides up to 21.2% in the whole territory. We conclude that using this type of multi-hazard map may be a useful tool for local administrators to identify areas susceptible to hazards at large scales as we demonstrated in this research.

This study evaluated the capability of convolutional neural network (NNETC) and recurrent neural network (NNETR) models for flood hazard mapping. A flood-inundation inventory (including 295 flooded sites) was used as the response variable and 10 flood-affecting factors were considered as the predictor variables. Flooded sites were then spatially randomly split in a 70:30 ratio for building flood models and for validation purposes. The prediction quality of the models was validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and root mean square error (RMSE). The validation results indicated that prediction performance of the NNETC model (AUC = 84%, RMSE = 0.163) was slightly better than that of the NNETR model (AUC = 82%, RMSE = 0.186). Both models indicated that terrain ruggedness index was the most important predictor, followed by slope and elevation. Although the model output had a relative error of up to 20% (based on AUC), this modeling approach could still be used as a reliable and rapid tool to generate a flood hazard map for urban areas, provided that a flood inundation inventory is available.

The destructive effects of floods are magnified in cities. Accurate models of urban flood susceptibility are required to mitigate this hazard mitigation and build resilience in cities. In this paper, we evaluate flood riskin Jiroft city, Iran, using a combination of machine learning and decision-making methods. Flood hazard maps were created using three state-of-the-art machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and boosted regression tree). The metadata supporting our analysis comprises 218 flood inundation points and a variety of derived factors: slope aspect, elevation, slope angle, rainfall, distance to streets, distance to rivers, land use/land cover, distance to urban drainages, urban drainage density, and curve number. We then employed the TOPSIS decision-making tool for urban flood vulnerability analysis, which is based on socio-economic factors such as building density, population density, building history, and socio-economic conditions. Finally, we derived an urban flood risk map for Jiroft based on flood hazard and vulnerability maps. Of the three models tested, the random forest model yielded the most accurate map. The results indicate that urban drainage density and distance to urban drainages are the most important factors in urban flood hazard modeling. As might be expected, areas with a high or very high population density are most vulnerable to flooding. These results show that flood risk mapping provide insights for priority planning in flood risk management, especially in areas with limited hydrological data.

Multicollinearity, frequency ratio (FR), and Geodetector methods were used for data preprocessing. Four metrics were utilized to assess the FSM performance: the root mean square error (RMSE), the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), the Taylor diagram, and the seed cell area index (SCAI). The results exhibited that all the suggested models have high accuracy of prediction, but the performance of Bagging-GA (RMSE (Train = 0.1793, Test = 0.4543)) was slightly better than RF-GA (RMSE (Train = 0.1803, Test = 0.4563)), Bagging (RMSE (Train = 0.2191, Test = 0.4566)), and RF (RMSE (Train = 0.2529, Test = 0.4724)). According to the ROC index, the Bagging-GA model (AUC = 0.935) was the most accurate in flood susceptibility modeling, followed by the RF-GA (AUC = 0.904), the Bagging (AUC = 0.872), and the RF (AUC = 0.847) models.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the comparative utility of six machine learning algorithms to improve flood susceptibility and ensemble techniques' capability to elucidate the underlying patterns of floods and make a more accurate prediction of flood susceptibilities in the Pagla river basin. In the present scenario, the frequency of flood conditions in this study area becomes high with heavy and sudden rainfall, so it is essential to study flood mitigation and measure. At first, a spatial flood database was built with 200 flood locations and sixteen flood influencing factors, and its process with the help of the Geographic Information System (GIS) environment and build up different models applying the machine learning techniques. It has found different flood susceptibility zone using machine learning-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree), Logistic Regression (LR), and Bagging helping GIS environment and the model validation using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve. Afterward, ensemble all the models to gate comparative accuracy of the flood zone. The calculated areas are under the very high flood susceptibility zone 8.69%, 14.92%, 14.17%, 12.98%, 14.65%, 13.24% and 13.41% for ANN, SVM, RF, REPTree, LR and Bagging, respectively.

The country experiences multi-type floods (i.e., fluvial, flash, pluvial, and surge floods) every year. However, areas prone to multi-type floods have not yet been assessed on a national scale. Here, we used locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), random subspace (RSS), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), random forest (RF), and M5P model tree algorithms in a hybrid ensemble to assess multi-type flood probabilities at a national scale in Bangladesh. We used historical flood data (1988â2020), remote sensing images (e.g., MODIS, Landsat 5â8, and Sentinel-1), and topography, hydrogeology, and environmental datasets to train and validate the proposed algorithms. According to the results, the stacking ensemble machine learning LWLR-RF algorithm performed better than the other algorithms in predicting flood probabilities, with R2 = 0.967â0.999, MAE = 0.022â0.117, RMSE = 0.029â0.148, RAE = 4.48â23.38%, and RRSE = 5.8829.69% for the training and testing datasets.

To do so, 13 conditioning factors influencing the flood occurrence in Brisbane river catchment in Australia (i.e., topographic, water?related, geological, and land use factors) were acquired for further processing and modeling. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANN), deep learning neural networks (DLNN), and optimized DLNN using particle swarm optimization (PSO) were exploited to predict and estimate the susceptible areas to the future floods. The significance of the conditioning factors analysis for the region highlighted that altitude, distance from river, STI, and slope played the most important roles, whereas SPI did not contribute to the hazardous situation. The performance of the models was evaluated against the statistical tests such as sensitivity, specificity, the area under curve (AUC), and true skill statistic (TSS). DLNN and PSO?DLNN models obtained the highest values of sensitivity (0.99) for the training stage to compare with ANN. Moreover, the vali-dations of specificity and TSS for PSO?DLNN recorded the highest values of 0.98 and 0.90, respec-tively, compared with those obtained by ANN and DLNN.

Finally, the following four ensembles were used to calculate the Flash-Flood Potential Index across the BÃ¢sca Chiojdului river basin: Deep Learning Neural NetworkâFrequency Ratio (DLNN-FR), Deep Learning Neural NetworkâWeights of Evidence (DLNN-WOE), Alternating Decision TreesâFrequency Ratio (ADT-FR) and Alternating Decision TreesâWeights of Evidence (ADT-WOE). The modelâs performances were assessed using several statistical metrics. Thus, in terms of Sensitivity, the highest value of 0.985 was achieved by the DLNN-FR model, meanwhile the lowest one (0.866) was assigned to ADT-FR ensemble. Moreover, the specificity analysis shows that the highest value (0.991) was attributed to DLNN-WOE algorithm, while the lowest value (0.892) was achieved by ADT-FR. During the training procedure, the models achieved overall accuracies between 0.878 (ADT-FR) and 0.985 (DLNN-WOE). K-index shows again that the most performant model was DLNN-WOE (0.97). The Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI) values revealed that the surfaces with high and very high flash-flood susceptibility cover between 46.57% (DLNN-FR) and 59.38% (ADT-FR) of the study zone. The use of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for results validation highlights the fact that FFPIDLNN-WOE is characterized by the most precise results with an Area Under Curve of 0.96.

While majority of those models produce reasonably accurate flood predictions, the outcomes are subject to uncertainty since flood susceptibility models (FSMs) may produce varying spatial predictions. However, there have not been many attempts to address these uncertainties because identifying spatial agreement in flood projections is a complex process. This study presents a framework for reducing spatial disagreement among four standalone and hybridized ML-based FSMs: random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and hybridized genetic algorithm-gaussian radial basis function-support vector regression (GA-RBF-SVR). Besides, an optimized model was developed combining the outcomes of those four models. The southwest coastal region of Bangladesh was selected as the case area. A comparable percentage of flood potential area (approximately 60% of the total land areas) was produced by all ML-based models. Despite achieving high prediction accuracy, spatial discrepancy in the model outcomes was observed, with pixel-wise correlation coefficients across different models ranging from 0.62 to 0.91. The optimized model exhibited high prediction accuracy and improved spatial agreement by reducing the number of classification errors. The framework presented in this study might aid in the formulation of risk-based development plans and enhancement of current early warning systems.

The basin is part of the Jazan region in southwestern Saudi Arabia and is characterized by mountainous terrain. Recently, this area has experienced many extreme natural processes, which become natural hazard events when they intersect with human activities (urban areas and infrastructures). In this work, the probabilities of the three main hazards; landslides, floods, and gully erosion are mapped using machine learning algorithms such as boosted regression tree (BRT), generalized linear model (GLM), Flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), random forest (RF), and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA). Several factors from various sources, including, topographic, geologic, meteorological, hydrologic, and human activities, were incorporated to produce the final multi-hazard susceptibility model. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the best predictive model for each type of natural hazard. AUC values between 80 and 90% indicated that the model was very good, and values above 90% indicated that the model had excellent predictive capability. Based on the accuracy evaluation, the FDA model was found to be the most accurate landslides prediction with an AUC value of (92.7%, excellent performance). The RF model was found to be the most accurate in predicting floods and erosion with AUC values of (97.2% - excellent and 83.3% - very good performance, respectively). Finally, a map of multi-hazard susceptibility was created by coupling of the mentioned three hazards. The results showed that 33.5% of the total area is safe (no-hazard), while 66.5% is characterized by at least a single hazard and a combination of two or three hazards.

A first step towards securing lives and infrastructure is the susceptibility mapping and predicting of occurrence sites of FF. Several studies have been applied using an ensemble machine learning model (EMLM) but measuring FF magnitude using a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (MCL) and geohydrological models have not been widely applied. This study aims to modify a hybrid approach by testing three machine learning models. These are boosted regression tree (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), and naive Bayes tree (NBT) for FF susceptibility mapping at the northern part of the United Arab Emirates (NUAE). This is followed by applying a group of accuracy metrics (precision, recall and F1 score) and the receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The result demonstrated that the BRT has the highest performance for FF susceptibility mapping followed by the CART and NBT. After that, the produced FF map using the BRT was then modified by dividing it into seven basins, and a set of new FF conditioning parameters namely alluvial plain width, basin gradient and mean slope for each basin was calculated for measuring FF magnitude. The results showed that the mountainous and narrower basins (e.g., RAK, Masafi, Fujairah, and Rol Dadnah) have the highest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude, while the wider alluvial plains (e.g., Al Dhaid) have the lowest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude. The proposed approach is an effective approach to improve the susceptibility mapping of FF, landslides, land subsidence, and groundwater potentiality obtained using ensemble machine learning, which is used widely in the literature.

Our work aims to propose a state-of-the-art model for susceptibility mapping of the flash flood using the decision tree random subspace ensemble optimized by hybrid firefly-particle swarm optimization (HFPS), namely the HFPS-RSTree model. In this work, we used data from a flood inventory map consisting of 1866 polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and a field survey conducted in the northwest mountainous area of the Van Ban district, Lao Cai Province in Vietnam. A total of eleven flooding conditioning factors (soil type, geology, rainfall, river density, elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), plant curvature, and profile curvature) were used as explanatory variables. These indicators were compiled from a geological and mineral resources map, soil type map, and topographic map, ALOS PALSAR DEM 30 m, and Landsat-8 imagery. The HFPS-RSTree model was trained and verified using the inventory map and the eleven conditioning variables and then compared with four machine learning algorithms, i.e., the support vector machine (SVM), the random forests (RF), the C4.5 decision trees (C4.5 DT), and the logistic model trees (LMT) models. We employed a range of statistical standard metrics to assess the predictive performance of the proposed model. The results show that the HFPS-RSTree model had the best predictive performance and achieved better results than those of other benchmarks with the ability to predict flash flood, reaching an overall accuracy of over 90%. It can be concluded that the proposed approach provides new insights into flash flood prediction in mountainous regions.

The physical hydrologic models of flash flood prediction of any large area is very difficult to compute as it requires lot of data and time. Therefore remote sensing data based models (from statistical to machine learning) have become highly popular due to open data access and lesser prediction times. There is a continuous effort to improve the prediction accuracy of these models through introducing new methods. This study is focused on flash flood modeling through novel hybrid machine learning models, which can improve the prediction accuracy. The hybrid machine learning ensemble approaches that combine the three meta-classifiers (Real AdaBoost, Random Subspace, and MultiBoosting) with J48 (a tree-based algorithm that can be used to evaluate the behavior of the attribute vector for any defined number of instances) were used in the Gorganroud River Basin of Iran to assess flood susceptibility (FS). A total of 426 flood positions as dependent variables and a total of 14 flood conditioning factors (FCFs) as independent variables were used to model the FS. Several threshold-dependent and independent statistical tests were applied to verify the performance and predictive capability of these machine learning models, such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the success rate curve (SRC) and prediction rate curve (PRC), efficiency (E), root-mean square-error (RMSE), and true skill statistics (TSS). The valuation of the FCFs was done using AdaBoost, frequency ratio (FR), and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models. In the flooding of the study area, altitude, land use/land cover (LU/LC), distance to stream, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and rainfall played important roles. The Random Subspace J48 (RSJ48) ensemble method with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931 (SRC), 0.951 (PRC), E of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.87, and TSS of 0.78, has become the most effective ensemble in predicting the FS. The FR technique also showed good performance and reliability for all models. Map removal sensitivity analysis (MRSA) revealed that the FS maps have the highest sensitivity to elevation. Based on the findings of the validation methods, the FS maps prepared using the machine learning ensemble techniques have high robustness and can be used to advise flood management initiatives in flood-prone areas.

In this study, six machine learning models were utilized for flood risk assessment of the Pearl River Delta, in which the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were firstly applied in this field. Twelve indices were chosen and 2000 sample points were created for model training and testing. Hyperparameter optimization of the models was conducted to ensure fair comparisons. Due to uncertainty in the sample dataset, recorded inundation hot-spots were utilized to validate the rationality of the flood risk zoning maps. After determining the optimal model, the driving factors of different flood risk levels were investigated. Urban and rural areas and coastal and inland areas were also compared to determine the flood risk mechanism in different highest-risk areas. The results showed that the GBDT performed best and provided the most reasonable flood risk result among the six models. A comparison of the driving factors at different risk levels indicated that the disaster-inducing factor, disaster-breeding environment, and disasterbearing body were not definitely becoming more serious as the flood risk increased. In the highest-risk areas, rural areas were featured by worse disaster-breeding environment than urban areas, and the disaster-inducing factors of coastal areas were more serious than those of inland areas.

Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) are two efficient ways to spatially predict Flood Risk Mapping (FRM). In this study, a web-based platform called the Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Google Company, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to obtain flood risk indices for the Galikesh River basin, Northern Iran. With the aid of Landsat 8 satellite imagery and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), 11 risk indices (Elevation (El), Slope (Sl), Slope Aspect (SA), Land Use (LU), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), River Distance (RD), Waterway and River Density (WRD), Soil Texture (ST]), and Maximum One-Day Precipitation (M1DP)) were provided. In the next step, all of these indices were imported into ArcMap 10.8 (Esri, West Redlands, CA, USA) software for index normalization and to better visualize the graphical output. Afterward, an intelligent learning machine (Random Forest (RF)), which is a robust data mining technique, was used to compute the importance degree of each index and to obtain the flood hazard map. According to the results, the indices of WRD, RD, M1DP, and El accounted for about 68.27 percent of the total flood risk. Among these indices, the WRD index containing about 23.8 percent of the total risk has the greatest impact on floods. According to FRM mapping, about 21 and 18 percent of the total areas stood at the higher and highest risk areas, respectively. Â© 2021 by the authors.

There is a need to develop accurate models for flood susceptibility prediction and mapping, which can be helpful in developing more efficient flood management plans. In this study, the Partial Decision Tree (PART) classifier and the AdaBoost, Bagging, Dagging, and Random Subspace ensembles learning techniques were combined to develop novel GIS-based ensemble computational models (ABPART, BPART, DPART and RSSPART) for flood susceptibility mapping in the Quang Binh Province, Vietnam. In total, 351 flood locations were used in the model study. This data was divided into a 70:30 ratio for model training (70% ? 255 locations) and (30% ? 96 locations) for model validation. Ten flood influencing factors, namely elevation, slope, curvature, flow direction, flow accumulation, river density, distance from river, rainfall, land-use, and geology, were used for the development of models. The OneR feature selection method was used to select and prioritize important factors for the spatial modeling. The results revealed that land-use, geology, and slope are the most important conditioning factors in the occurrence of floods in the study area. Standard statistical methods, including the ROC curve (AUC), were used for the performance evaluation of models. Results indicated that the performance of all models was good (AUC > 0.9) and RSSPART (AUC = 0.959) outperformed the others. Thus, the RSSPART model can be used for accurately predicting and mapping flood susceptibility.

The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), like many mountainous regions, is the site of multiple and overlapping natural hazards, but the distribution of multi-hazard risk and the populations exposed to it are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution transboundary models describing susceptibility to floods, landslides, and wildfires to understand population exposure to multi-hazard risk across the HKH. These models are created from historical remotely sensed data and hazard catalogs by the maximum entropy (Maxent) machine learning technique. Our results show that human settlements in the HKH are disproportionately concentrated in areas of high multi-hazard risk. In contrast, low-hazard areas are disproportionately unpopulated. Nearly half of the population in the region lives in areas that are highly susceptible to more than one hazard. Warm low-altitude foothill areas with perennially moist soils were identified as highly susceptible to multiple hazards. This area comprises only 31% of the study region, but is home to 49% of its population. The results also show that areas susceptible to multiple hazards are also major corridors of current migration and urban expansion, suggesting that current rates and patterns of urbanization will continue to put more people at risk. This study establishes that the population in the HKH is concentrated in areas susceptible to multiple hazards and suggests that current patterns of human movement will continue to increase exposure to multi-hazards in the HKH.

An inventory map with approximately 850 flooding sites is based on several post-flood surveys. The inventory dataset is randomly split between training (70%) and testing (30%). The AUC-ROC results are 97.9%, 99.5%, and 99.5% for CatBoost, LightGBM, and RF, respectively. The FSMs developed by the ML methods show good agreement in terms of an extension with flood inundation maps developed using the rainfall-runoff model. The modelsâ FSMs showed 10â13% of the total area to be highly susceptible to flooding, consistent with RRI's flood map. The FSMs show that downstream areas (both urbanized and agricultural) are under high and very high levels of susceptibility.

In recent times, flood hazard susceptibility mapping has become a prime concern in minimizing the worst impact of this global threat; but the nonlinear relationship between several flood causative factors and the dynamicity of risk levels makes it complicated and confronted with substantial challenges to reliable assessment. Therefore, we have considered SVM, RF, and ANNâthree distinctive ML algorithms in the GIS platformâto delineate the flood hazard risk zones of the subtropical Kangsabati river basin, West Bengal, India; which experienced frequent flood events because of intense rainfall throughout the monsoon season. In our study, all adopted ML algorithms are more efficient in solving all the non-linear problems in flood hazard risk assessment; multi-collinearity analysis and Pearsonâs correlation coefficient techniques have been used to identify the collinearity issues among all fifteen adopted flood causative factors. In this research, the predicted results are evaluated through six prominent and reliable statistical (âAUC-ROC, specificity, sensitivity, PPV, NPV, F-scoreâ) and one graphical (Taylor diagram) technique and shows that ANN is the most reliable modeling approach followed by RF and SVM models. The values of AUC in the ANN model for the training and validation datasets are 0.901 and 0.891, respectively. The derived result states that about 7.54% and 10.41% of areas accordingly lie under the high and extremely high flood danger risk zones. Thus, this study can help the decision-makers in constructing the proper strategy at the regional and national levels to mitigate the flood hazard in a particular region. This type of information may be helpful to the various authorities to implement this outcome in various spheres of decision making.

Assessing flash flood susceptibility by hybrid models of statistical and machine learning methods is essential for flood mitigation strategies and disaster preparedness. Although classifying the flash flood conditioning factors becomes a crucial step before applying these hybrid models, their impact on the accuracy of integrated modeling is still unclear. Most previous studies used natural break classification (NBC) and quantile classification methods by default to conduct the classification, but more classification methods have not been tried. In this context, this study introduced three clustering algorithms of K-Means, Expectation Maximization, and ISOMaximum likelihood algorithm (ISOMax) into the classification of factors, and compared them to NBC and quantile classification. To test the impact of classification methods on integrated modeling, these classification results were applied into the construction of three hybrid models (i.e., the integrating of frequency ratio with support vector machines, random forest, and bayesian-regularization neural networks). Then, the accuracy of these hybrid models was evaluated by using ROC curves and statistical indicators. The classification results show that the clustering intervals in the same factor varied with classification algorithms. It can be found from the model performance evaluation results that different classification algorithms will lead to discrepancies in accuracy of integrated modeling. Compared to NBC, the ISOMax allows a better fitting and prediction ability of hybrid models in this study. The application of clustering algorithm provides a new perspective for improving the accuracy of integrated modeling.

For this aim, flood-prone areas and their susceptibility are mapped using machine learning techniques including boosted regression tree (BRT) and generalized linear model (GLM) with the help of Sentinel 3 satellite images in Google Earth Engine. The BRT model achieved the highest precision (AUC = 81.10%) in comparison to GLM (AUC = 78.30%) and was utilized for evaluating the flood risk on critical infrastructures.

With the rise in population growth and the spread of infrastructural development, the level of risk has increased over time. Therefore, the prediction of flood susceptible area is a key challenge for the adoption of management plans. Flood susceptibility modeling is technically a common work, but it is still a very tough job to validate flood susceptible models in a very rigorous and scientific manner. Therefore, the present work in the Atreyee River Basin of India and Bangladesh was planned to establish artificial neural network (ANN), radial basis function (RBF), random forest (RF) and their ensemble-based flood susceptibility models. The flood susceptible models were constructed based on nine flood conditioning parameters. The flood susceptibility models were validated in a conventional way using the receiver operating curve (ROC). To validate the flood-susceptible models, a two dimensional (2D) hydraulic flood simulation model was developed. Also, the index of flood vulnerability model was developed and applied for validating the flood susceptible models, which was a very unique way to validate the predictive models. Friedman test and Wilcoxon Signed rank test were employed to compare the generated flood susceptible models. Results showed that 11.95%â12.99% of the entire basin area (10188.4 km2) comes under very high flood-susceptible zones. Accuracy evaluation results have shown that the performance of ensemble flood susceptible models outperforms other standalone machine learning models. The flood simulation model and IFV model were also spatially adjusted with the flood susceptibility models. Therefore, the present study recommended for the ensemble flood susceptibility prediction and IFV based validation along with conventional ways.

Over 55% of the valleys identified are characterized by high and very high values of FFPSI.

In this study, the aim was to identify the areas susceptible to floods using and comparing two different approaches, namely the multi-criteria decision analysis-analytical hierarchy process (MCDA-AHP) and the machine learning-boosted classification (BCT) and boosted regression (BRT) tree. The study area was represented by the Top?a river basin, Slovakia. Altogether, seven relevant flood conditioning factors: elevation, slope, river network density, distance from river, flow accumulation, curve numbers and lithology as well as flood inventory database consisting of 107 flood locations were used. Based on the results, almost 40% of the study area is characterized by high to very high flood susceptibility using the MCDA-AHP. In case of the BCT and BRT models, the share of high and very high flood susceptibility class on the basin area is 45% and 38%, respectively. Validation of the performed flood susceptibility models confirmed generally higher accuracy of the machine learning models. The accuracy of the MCDA-AHP model was 81.33% while the accuracy of the boosted tree models was 87.70% and 91.42%, respectively, for classification and regression.

It should be noted that flash-flood events are triggered by heavy rainfall in small river catchments. To achieve the proposed results, a total of 8 flash-flood predictors (slope angle, plan curvature, hydrological soil groups, land use, convergence index, profile curvature, topographic position index, aspect) along with a sample of 111 torrential phenomena points were used as input datasets in the next four algorithms: Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), Deep Learning Neural Network -Analytical Hierarchy Process (DLNN-AHP), Multilayer Perceptron - Analytical Hierarchy Process (MLP-AHP) and NaÃ¯ve Bayes - Analytical Hierarchy Process (NB-AHP). The Analytical Hierarchy Process was used to calculate the coefficients for each class/category of flash-flood predictors. The torrential points sample was split into training (70%) and validating samples (30%). The modelling was done in Excel, SPSS and R software (H2O package), while the result mapping was performed in ArcGIS 10.5 software. The analysis revealed that the high and very high susceptibility degrees are spread over a maximum of 35.01% of the study area. The best performances, demonstrated by an AUC-ROC of 0.984, are associated with the Deep Learning Neural Network â Analytical Hierarchy Process model, followed by NaÃ¯ve Bayes â Analytical Hierarchy Process model (AUC = 0.976), Multilayer Perceptron - Analytical Hierarchy Process model (AUC = 0.882) and Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (AUC = 0.807).

However, operationalising and quantifying resilience is still a challenge. In Pakistan, very limited research has been done to assess community resilience to floods. The present study proposed an integrated flood resilience model called the âcapacity-based flood resilience model (CapFlooR-M)â, which is based on, machine learning (ML), geographical information system (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The CapFlooR-M incorporates four main componentsâflood hazard susceptibility (Is), coping capacity (Cc), adaptive capacity (Ac), and transformative capacity (Tc). Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were used to create a flood susceptibility map, and the AHP was used to compute the relative scores of core capacities, such as Cc, Ac, and Tc and their respective maps were generated. Finally, the susceptibility map was integrated with Cc, Ac, and Tc maps via overlay analysis in GIS to develop a flood resilience map. The overall results reveal that the northwestern and southwestern parts (36.64%; 505 km2) of the study area have moderate to very high resilience, while the central and southeastern parts (63.46%; 877 km2) have very low to low resilience. The findings of this novel approach can support policymakers, land use planners, and other relevant stakeholders to build resilience against flood hazards.

This study proposed novel intelligence algorithms based on a hybrid of several ensemble ML models (i.e., Bagged Flexible Discriminant Analysis (BAFDA), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XBG), Rotation Forest (ROF) and Boosted Generalized Additive Model (BGAM)) and wrapper-based factor optimization algorithms (i.e., Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Boruta) to improve the accuracy of FFS mapping at Neka-Haraz watershed in Iran. In addition, the Random Search (RS) method is proposed for meta-optimization of the developed hybrid models hyper-parameters. This study considers 20 flash flood conditioning factors (CgFs) and 380 flood and non-flood locations to create a geospatial database. The performance of each hybrid model was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and several validation methods, such as efficiency.

The state-of-art ML models were utilized for the predictive modeling, including AdaBoost-RBF, Bagging-RBF, MultiBoostAB-RBF, and Random Sub-spaceRBF, with Radial Basis Function (RBF) serving as the primary classifier. The AdaBoost-RBF model outperformed all others in predicting landslide and flash flood vulnerability. The resulting map showed that 44.89% or 14,183 ha is in very high susceptibility zones, 15.55% or 4914 ha is in high susceptibility zones, 10.37% or 3.275 ha is in moderate susceptibility zones, 13.69% or 4324 ha is in low susceptibility zones, and 15.50% or 4899 ha is in very low susceptibility zones.

As coastal systems continue to become more socially and environmentally complex, the damage these hazards cause is expected to increase and intensify. To reduce such negative impacts, vulnerable coastal areas and their associated risks must be identified and assessed. In this study, we assessed the flooding risk to coastal areas of South Korea using multiple machine learning algorithms. We predicted coastal areas with high flooding risks, as this aspect has not been adequately addressed in previous studies. We forecasted hazards under different representative concentration pathway climate change scenarios and regional climate models while considering ratios of sea level rise. Based on the results, a risk probability map was developed using a probability ranging from 0 to 1, where higher values of probability indicate areas at higher risk of compound events such as high tides and heavy rainfall. The accuracy of the average receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.946 using a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The predicted risk probability in 10 year increments from the 2030s to the 2080s showed that the risk probability for southern coastal areas is higher than those of the eastern and western coastal areas.

The new model couples a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model with an extreme learning machine (ELM) and backpropagation (BP) structure optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) named GA-BN-NN model. We applied the support vector machine (SVM) technique to a database of 194 flood locations with ten conditioning factors. An artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm with a multi-layer perceptron function, MLP-BP, optimized by a genetic algorithm, GA-MLP, and a shuffled frog-leaping algorithm, SFLA-MLP, were used as benchmark models for assessing the power prediction of the proposed model. Statistical measures, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-measure and Jaccard coefficient, and root mean square error, were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, respectively, of the training and testing datasets. We found that all ten factors are positively correlated with flood occurrence, but slope angle has the highest average merit (AM=9.7) and thus contributes most to the occurrence of flooding. Results indicate that the GA-BN-NN model has the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy (AUC=0.966) and hence outperforms other ensemble learning models that we tested â the SFLA-MLP, MLP-BP, and GA-MLP models.

For this purpose, ten flood causative factors were chosen based on data availability and local conditions along with the spatial extent of the large flood that affected the study area on 13 May 2013. The factors used involved topography-related factors (elevation, slope, curvature, topographic wetness index, and stream power index), lithology, soil, land use/land cover, the average of annual rainfall, and distance to rivers. The multicollinearity test proved that there was no multicollinearity problem among the factors used. Investigating the worth of factors in building the models using information gain ratio showed that the most important factors that play a major role in controlling flood proneness were elevation, followed by annual rainfall average, distance to rivers, land use/land cover, lithology, and soil. The models were employed using the most important factors to get flood proneness maps. The values of flood proneness were categorized into five classes using a quantile classification scheme. For validating the models, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used. The AUC for prediction data set was 0.793, 0.786, 0.779, 0.754, and 0.753 for classification and regression trees, boosted regression trees, logistic regression, information value, and frequency ratio, respectively. For the best performance model (classification and regression trees), the areas occupied by flood proneness zones were 2735 km2, 2809 km2, 2816 km2, 2732 km2, and 2801 km2, for very low, low, moderate, high, and very high flood proneness zones, respectively. The main conclusion is that the machine learning models are optimal in mapping flood proneness in the study area, followed by the multivariate and bivariate models.

The present work was, therefore, to investigate the performance of the resolution effects, such as coarse (Landsat and SRTM) and high (Sentinel-2 and ALOS PALSAR) resolution data on the flood susceptible models. Another motive of this study was to construct very high precision and robust flood susceptible models using standalone and ensemble machine learning algorithms. In the present study, fifteen flood conditioning parameters were generated from both coarse and high resolution datasets. Then, the ANN-multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), bagging (B)-MLP, B-gaussian processes (B-GP) and B-SMOreg algorithms were used to integrate the flood conditioning parameters for generating the flood susceptible models. Furthermore, the influence of flood conditioning parameters on the modelling of flood susceptibility was investigated by proposing an ROC based sensitivity analysis. The validation of flood susceptibility models is also another challenge. In the present study, we proposed an index of flood vulnerability model to validate flood susceptibility models along with conventional statistical techniques, such as the ROC curve. Results showed that the coarse resolution based flood susceptibility MLP model has appeared as the best model (area under curve: 0.94) and it has predicted 11.65 % of the area as very high flood susceptible zones (FSz), followed by RF, B-MLP, B-GP, and B-SMOreg. Similarly, the high resolution based flood susceptibility model using MLP has predicted 19.34 % of areas as very high flood susceptible zones, followed by RF (14.32 %),B-MLP (14.88 %), B-GP, and B-SMOreg. On the other hand, ROC based sensitivity analysis showed that elevation influences flood susceptibility largely for coarse and high resolution based models, followed by drainage densityand flow accumulation. In addition, the accuracy assessment using the IFV model revealed that the MLP model outperformed all other models in the case of a high resolution imageThe coarser resolution image's performance level is acceptable but quite low. So, the study recommended the use of high resolution images for developing a machine learning algorithm based flood susceptibility model.

Efficient flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) can reduce the risk of this hazard, and has become the main approach in flood risk management. In this study, we evaluated the prediction ability of artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms for hard and soft supervised machine learning classification in FSM by using three ANN algorithms (multi-layer perceptron (MLP), fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (FART), self-organizing map (SOM)) with different activation functions (sigmoidal (-S), linear (-L), commitment (-C), typicality (-T)). We used integration of these models for predicting the spatial expansion probability of flood events in the Ajichay river basin, northwest Iran. Inputs to the ANN were spatial data on 10 flood influencing factors (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, lithology, land use, rainfall, and distance to the river). The FSMs obtained as model outputs were trained and tested using flood inventory datasets earned based on previous records of flood damage in the region for the Ajichay river basin. Sensitivity analysis using one factor-at-a-time (OFAT) and all factors-at-a-time (AFAT) demonstrated that all influencing factors had a positive impact on modeling to generate FSM, with altitude having the greatest impact and curvature the least. Model validation was carried out using total operating characteristic (TOC) with an area under the curve (AUC). The highest success rate was found for MLP-S (92.1%) and the lowest for FART-T (75.8%). The projection rate in the validation of FSMs produced by MLP-S, MLP-L, FART-C, FART-T, SOM-C, and SOM-T was found to be 90.1%, 89.6%, 71.7%, 70.8%, 83.8%, and 81.1%, respectively. While integration of hard and soft supervised machine learning classification with activation functions of MLP-S and MLP-L showed a strong flood prediction capability for proper planning and management of flood hazards, MLP-S is a promising method for predicting the spatial expansion probability of flood events.

Urban flood mapping and its use in making an urban development plan can reduce flood damages and losses. Constantly producing urban flood hazard maps using models that rely on the availability of detailed hydraulic-hydrological data is a major challenge especially in developing countries. In this study, urban flood hazard map was produced with limited data using three machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF) and NaÃ¯ve Bayes for Kermanshah city, Iran. The flood hazard predicting factors used in modeling were: slope, land use, precipitation, distance to river, distance to channel, curve number (CN) and elevation. Flood inventory map was produced based on available reports and field surveys, that 117 flooded points and 163 non-flooded points were identified. Models performance was evaluated based on area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), Kappa statistic and hits and miss analysis. The results show that RF model (AUC-ROC = 99.5%, Kappa = 98%, Accuracy = 90%, Success ratio = 99%, Threat score = 90% and Heidke skill score = 98%) performed better than other models. The results also showed that distance to canal, land use and CN have shown more contribution among others for modeling the flood and precipitation had the least effect among other factors. The findings show that machine learning methods can be a good alternative to distributed models to predict urban flood-prone areas where there are lack of detailed hydraulic and hydrological data.

Flash flood driving factors, including elevation, slope, curvature, slope-aspect, lithological rock units, distance from streams, stream density, and topographic wetness index (TWI) were selected. Based on the machine learning models, the XGBoost and KNN algorithms were quite similar, in terms of variables importance, with distance from the stream network, slope angle, elevation, and stream density identified as the key driving factors, in order of importance. It is often difficult to allocate model parameter settings; therefore, hyper-parameter setting optimization was applied to improve model prediction performance. The models were trained using 70% flooding location and 70% non-flooding data, with the remaining 30% flooding and 30% non-flooding location data used for model and simulation result validation. The applied models exhibited accuracies of 90.2% and 80.7% for XGBoost and KNN, respectively, showing that the XGBoost algorithm performed better than KNN in this situation.

Previous studies explored flash flood susceptibility models; however, there is still a lack of case studies in the transport sector. This paper aimed to develop advanced hybrid machine learning (ML) algorithms for flash flood susceptibility modeling and mapping using data from the road network National Highway 6 in Hoa Binh province, Vietnam. A single ML model of reduced error pruning trees (REPT) and four hybrid ML models of Decorate-REPT, AdaBoostM1-REPT, Bagging-REPT, and MultiBoostAB-REPT were applied to develop flash flood susceptibility maps. Field surveys were conducted about the flash flood locations on the 115-km route length of the National Highway 6 in 2017, 2018, and 2019 flood events. This study used 88 flash flood locations and 14 flood conditioning factors to construct and validate the proposed models. Statistical metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, root mean square error, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, were applied to evaluate the modelsâ performance and accuracy. The DCREPT model showed the best performance (AUC = 0.988) among the training models and had the highest prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.991) among the testing models. We found that 12,572Â ha (Decorate-REPT), 9564Â ha (AdaBoostM1-REPT), 11,954Â ha (Bagging-REPT), 14,432Â ha (MultiBoostAB-REPT), and 17,660Â ha (REPT) of the 3-km buffer area of the highway are in the high- and very high-flash-flood-susceptibility areas.

Therefore, an accurate prediction of susceptible areas to flash floods is crucial for developing measures to prevent, avoid, and minimize damages associated with flash floods. The aim of this research is to propose a new state-of-the-art model based on hybridizing Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) and the Credal Decision Tree (CDT) ensemble, namely the QPSO-CDTreeEns model, for spatial prediction of the flash flood. The concept of the proposed model is to build a forest tree of the CDT established through the Random Subspace ensemble. Therein, QPSO is integrated to optimize the three parameters, the subspace size, number of trees, and the maximum depth of trees. A district suffered from a high frequency of flash floods in the north-western mountainous area of Vietnam was selected as a case study. In this regard, a geospatial database that includes a total of 1698 flash flood and inundation polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images and ten input indicators were used to construct and to verify the proposed model. The result shows that the QPSO-CDT-Ens model performed well (Overall accuracy = 90.4, Kappa coefficient = 0.807) and outperformed the five machine learning algorithms in flash flood susceptibility mapping. Among the ten factors, the land-use/land-cover (LULC), the slope, the curvature, and the TWI are the most important indicators. We conclude that the proposed model is a promising tool for flash flood susceptibility mapping in the tropics and may assist decision-makers in sustainable land-use planning in the national disaster mitigation strategies.

The collected flood data accompanied with different variables (digital elevation model and slope have been considered as topographic variables, land use/land cover, precipitation, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel and depth to groundwater as environmental variables) were applied to novel hybridized model based on neural network and swarm intelligence-grey wolf algorithm (NN-SGW) to map flood-inundation. Several confusion matrix criteria were used for accuracy evaluation by cutoff-dependent and independent metrics (e.g., efficiency (E), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)). The accuracy of the flood inundation map produced by the NN-SGW model was compared with that of maps produced by four state-of-the-art benchmark models: random forest (RF), logistic model tree (LMT), classification and regression trees (CART), and J48 decision tree (J48DT). The NN-SGW model outperformed all benchmark models in both training (E = 90.5%, PPV = 93.7%, NPV = 87.3%, AUC = 96.3%) and validation (E = 79.4%, PPV = 85.3%, NPV = 73.5%, AUC = 88.2%). As the NN-SGW model produced the most accurate flood-inundation map, it can be employed for robust flood contingency planning. Based on the obtained results from NN-SGW model, distance from channel, distance from river, and depth to groundwater were identified as the most important variables for spatial prediction of urban flood inundation.

In hindsight, it opened an engrossed area of research for flood hazard mapping, something that has previously been pursued yet not embraced as must they should. In pursuit of reconciling the decision-makers and authorities with the successful application of machine/deep learning models in pattern extraction and detection of hotspots, we employed a deep learning model named Deep Belief Network (DBN), and then it was hybridized using particle swarm optimization (DBN-PSO) and genetic algorithm (DBN-GA). Their results were compared to Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) that have been known as benchmark models in the field of flood susceptibility. The area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) were used for performance assessment through three sample partitioning replicates, which further indicated modelsâ predictive performance and robustness. Results revealed that DBN-PSO was the best model in terms of prediction performance (AUCmean = 0.957, TSSmean = 0.748) and robustness (RAUC = 0.6%, RTSS = 0.8%). Furthermore, all the standalone DBN and its hybrid models outperformed benchmark models including RF (AUCmean = 0.911, TSSmean = 0.714, RAUC = 1.5%, RTSS = 2.1%) and SVM (AUCmean = 0.899, TSSmean = 0.692, RAUC = 2.1%, RTSS = 2.3%). In addition, drainage density was the most important factor in flood susceptibility modeling. Accordingly, about 13.5% of the region was addressed as the high hazard zone of flood occurrence based on the DBN-PSO model, which should be considered for further pragmatic actions.

Inadequate corporate strategic stormwater management or maintenance plans make the issue even worse. Therefore, efforts have been consolidated to confront flood hazards by incorporating precautious and proactive strategies toward better forecasting and preventing flood disasters or even mitigating the damage if it occurs. Further, there is inadequacy in incorporating computational intelligence techniques to detect flood susceptibility in road networks. This paper proposes a data-driven flood risk areas detection model incorporating various ensemble and generic machine learning techniques as well as autoML tools. A systematic and iterative approach is followed to examine different solutions to tackle the data balancing problem, including oversampling and undersampling techniques. Also, hyperparameter optimisation is undertaken using both grid search and genetic algorithms, and the modelsâ performance using each designated strategy is reported and assessed. The empirical results from the experiments indicate that the optimised ensembled Extremely Randomized Trees classifier proves an ability to perform well on the given dataset with an averaged ROC AUC value of 90% and outperforms several state-of-the-art generic, ensembled, and autoML classifiers in all evaluation measures.

In this study, we proposed combining logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models with embedded feature selection (EFS) to filter specific feature sets for the two models and map flash flood susceptibility in the mainstream basin of the Songhua River. According to the EFS results, the optimized feature sets included 32 and 28 features for the LR and RF models, respectively, and the composition of the two optimal feature sets was similar and distinct. Overall, the relevant vegetation cover and river features exhibit relatively high effects overall for flash floods in the study area. The LR and RF models provided accurate and reliable flash flood susceptibility maps (FFSMs). The RF model (accuracy = 0.8834, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.9486) provided a better prediction capacity than the LR model (accuracy = 0.8634, AUC = 0.9277).

The serious impact caused by floods is the reason for the urgent need to provide an appropriate flood susceptibility map (FSM). Floods can be triggered by various meteorological events, such as storms in coastal areas. On 14 March 2019, Cyclone Idai produced massive and severe flooding inundation in the coastal city of Beira, Mozambique. The extensive flood damage in Beira necessitated providing an accurate FSM and analyzing the factors associated with flooding. This study integrated the data of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), geographic information system (GIS), and two deep learning models, namely, the group method of data handling (GMDH) and convolutional neural network (CNN), to generate a precise FSM. We compared the performance of CNN and GMDH models in generating the FSMs for a case study of the March 2019 flood in the Beira Area, Mozambique. The result showed that the models produced a similar pattern of FSM, where the areas near the river, having a lower slope and lower altitude, have a higher flood risk. The FSM generated by CNN and GMDH models were compared to find a better model for flood risk assessment. The prediction performance of CNN model (AUC = 0.90 and RMSE = 0.022) was better than the result of GMDH model (AUC = 0.87 and RMSE = 0.089).

A first step towards securing lives and infrastructure is the susceptibility mapping and predicting of occurrence sites of FF. Several studies have been applied using an ensemble machine learning model (EMLM) but measuring FF magnitude using a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (MCL) and geohydrological models have not been widely applied. This study aims to modify a hybrid approach by testing three machine learning models. These are boosted regression tree (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), and naive Bayes tree (NBT) for FF susceptibility mapping at the northern part of the United Arab Emirates (NUAE). This is followed by applying a group of accuracy metrics (precision, recall and F1 score) and the receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The result demonstrated that the BRT has the highest performance for FF susceptibility mapping followed by the CART and NBT. After that, the produced FF map using the BRT was then modified by dividing it into seven basins, and a set of new FF conditioning parameters namely alluvial plain width, basin gradient and mean slope for each basin was calculated for measuring FF magnitude. The results showed that the mountainous and narrower basins (e.g., RAK, Masafi, Fujairah, and Rol Dadnah) have the highest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude, while the wider alluvial plains (e.g., Al Dhaid) have the lowest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude. The proposed approach is an effective approach to improve the susceptibility mapping of FF, landslides, land subsidence, and groundwater potentiality obtained using ensemble machine learning, which is used widely in the literature.

Recently, machine learning models have been used for flood susceptibility mapping. However, even when these algorithms are provided with adequate ground truth training samples, they can fail to predict flood extends reliably. On the other hand, the height above nearest drainage (HAND) model can produce flood prediction maps with limited accuracy. The objective of this research is to produce an accurate and dynamic flood modeling technique to produce flood maps as a function of water level by combining the HAND model and machine learning. In this paper, the HAND model was utilized to generate a preliminary flood map; then, the predictions of the HAND model were used to produce pseudo training samples for a R.F. model. To improve the R.F. training stage, five of the most effective flood mapping conditioning factors are used, namely, Altitude, Slope, Aspect, Distance from River and Land use/cover map. In this approach, the R.F. model is trained to dynamically estimate the flood extent with the pseudo training points acquired from the HAND model. However, due to the limited accuracy of the HAND model, a random sample consensus (RANSAC) method was used to detect outliers. The accuracy of the proposed model for flood extent prediction, was tested on different flood events in the city of Fredericton, NB, Canada in 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019. Furthermore, to ensure that the proposed model can produce accurate flood maps in other areas as well, it was also tested on the 2019 flood in Gatineau, QC, Canada. Accuracy assessment metrics, such as overall accuracy, Cohenâs kappa coefficient, Matthews correlation coefficient, true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR), were used to compare the predicted flood extent of the study areas, to the extent estimated by the HAND model and the extent imaged by Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellites. The results confirm that the proposed model can improve the flood extent prediction of the HAND model without using any ground truth training data. Â© 2020 by the authors.

While large-scale climate patterns such as teleconnections and climate change become important at this scale, it remains a challenge to represent the local hydrological cycle over various watersheds in a manner that is physically consistent with climate. As a result, global models tend to suffer from a lack of available scenarios and flexibility that are key for planners, relief organizations, regulators, and the financial services industry to analyze the socioeconomic, demographic, and climatic factors affecting exposure. Here we introduce a data-driven, global, fast, flexible, and climate-consistent flood risk modeling framework for applications that do not necessarily require high-resolution flood mapping. We use statistical and machine learning methods to examine the relationship between historical flood occurrence and impact from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (1985â2017), and climatic, watershed, and socioeconomic factors for 4,734 HydroSHEDS watersheds globally. Using bias-corrected output from the NCAR CESM Large Ensemble (1980â2020), and the fitted statistical relationships, we simulate 1 million years of events worldwide along with the population displaced in each event. We discuss potential applications of the model and present global flood hazard and risk maps. The main value of this global flood model lies in its ability to quickly simulate realistic flood events at a resolution that is useful for large-scale socioeconomic and financial planning, yet we expect it to be useful to climate and natural hazard scientists who are interested in socioeconomic impacts of climate.

The Vembanad lake system (VLS) in Kerala, India, has faced adverse mishappening during 2018, 2019, and 2021 floods in the state due to torrential rainfall. The goal of this research is to construct effective decision tree-based machine learning models such as adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for integrating data, processing, and generating flood susceptibility maps. There are 18 conditioning parameters considered, which include seven categories and 11 numerical data. These seven categorical data were converted to numerical data, bringing the total amount of input data to 61. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) was utilized as the feature selection technique, and a total of 22 layers were chosen to feed into the machine learning models to generate the flood susceptibility maps. The efficiencies of the models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-area under the ROC curve (AUC), F1 score, accuracy, and kappa. According to the results, the performance of all four models demonstrated their practical application; however, XGBoost fared well in terms of the model's metrics.

Various validation methods, including area under the ROC curve (AUC), were used to validate and compare the models. The result of the modelsâ validation suggests that all models have good performance: AD Tree (AUC = 0.968), LM Tree (AUC = 0.967), REP Tree (AUC = 0.897), J48 (AUC = 0.953), and NB Tree (AUC = 0.986).

Mapping the probability of flash flood events remains challenges because of its complexity and rapid onset of precipitation. Thus, this study aims to propose a state-of-the-art data mining approach based on a hybrid equilibrium optimized SysFor, namely, the HE-SysFor model, for spatial prediction of flash floods. A tropical storm region located in the Northwest areas of Vietnam is selected as a case study. For this purpose, 1866 flash-flooded locations and ten indicators were used. The results show that the proposed HE-SysFor model yielded the highest predictive performance (total accuracy = 93.8%, Kappa index = 0.875, F1-score = 0.939, and AUC = 0.975) and produced the better performance than those of the C4.5 decision tree (C4.5), the radial basis function-based support vector machine (SVM-RBF), the logistic regression (LReg), and deep learning neural network (DeepLNN) models in both the training and the testing phases. Among the ten indicators, elevation, slope, and land cover are the most important. It is concluded that the proposed model provides an alternative tool and may help for effectively monitoring flash floods in tropical areas and robust policies for decision making in mitigating the flash flood impacts.

The results of these two models have been quantitatively compared for performance analysis in zoning flood susceptible areas of low altitudinal range, humid subtropical fluvial floodplain environment of the Middle Ganga Plain (MGP). This part of the MGP, which is in the central Ganga River Basin (GRB), is experiencing worse floods in the changing climatic scenario causing an increased level of loss of life and property. The MGP experiencing monsoonal subtropical humid climate, active tectonics induced ground subsidence, increasing population, and shifting landuse/landcover trends and pattern, is the best natural laboratory to test all the susceptibility prediction genre of models to achieve the choice of best performing model with the constant number of input parameters for this type of topoclimatic environmental setting. This will help in achieving the goal of model universality, i.e., finding out the best performing susceptibility prediction model for this type of topoclimatic setting with the similar number and type of input variables. Based on the highly accurate flood inventory and using 12 flood predictors (FPs) (selected using field experience of the study area and literature survey), two machine learning (ML) ensemble models developed by bagging frequency ratio (FR) and evidential belief function (EBF) with classification and regression tree (CART), CART-FR and CART-EBF, were applied for flood susceptibility zonation mapping. Flood and non-flood points randomly generated using flood inventory have been apportioned in 70:30 ratio for training and validation of the ensembles. Based on the evaluation performance using threshold-independent evaluation statistic, area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, 14 threshold-dependent evaluation metrices, and seed cell area index (SCAI) meant for assessing different aspects of ensembles, the study suggests that CART-EBF (AUCSR = 0.843; AUCPR = 0.819) was a better performant than CART-FR (AUCSR = 0.828; AUCPR = 0.802). The variability in performances of these novel-advanced ensembles and their comparison with results of other published models espouse the need of testing these as well as other genres of susceptibility models in other topoclimatic environments also.

Due to the lack of hydrological and meteorological information and disaster event inventory in Xinjiang, China, storm flood disaster (SFD) risk zoning is an effective technique in investigating the potential impact of SFD. In this study, the statistics about natural, social, and risk related to SFD are collated. With the help of the compiled inventory data, a disaster risk assessment model for storm flood is proposed for the Xinjiang region based on the random forest (RF) algorithm. Randomly selected negative and positive samples from the historical SFD locations are composed of five different total samples. The overall prediction accuracy of the five sample groups attained 83.48%, indicating that the proposed RF model can well capture the spatial distribution of SFD in Xinjiang. It should also be noted that the spatial heterogeneity and complexity of SFD had a significant effect on its spatial distribution in Xinjiang. There are spatial distribution characteristics of lowland plains and high plateaus; the main mountainous regions, plains in the middle-lower reaches of major rivers, and areas surrounding major lakes are prone to flooding. The variable importance RF indicates that the disaster risk is mainly affected by the following factors, including hazard factors, catastrophic intensity, population density, as well as economic development in the affected area. Besides, latitude, longitude, agricultural acreage, road density, distance from rivers, and the maximum monthly precipitation account for most of the increase in storm flooding disasters, and they are the main triggering point for SFD in Xinjiang. The proposed model provides some insight into the disaster in the mountainous region, and gives useful guidance for the national macro-control of flood prevention and disaster reduction.

Therefore, this study evaluated the factors contributing to flood and the precise location of high and very high flood susceptibility regions in Karachi. A new ensemble model (LR-SVM-MLP) is introduced to develop the susceptibility map and evaluate influencing factors. This ensemble model was formed by employing a stacking ensemble on Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). A spatial database was generated for the Karachi watershed, which included; twelve conditioning factors as independent variables, 652 flood points and the same number of non-flood points as dependent variables. This data was then randomly divided into 70% and 30% to train and validate models, respectively. To analyse the collinearity among factors and to scrutinize each variable's predictive power, multicollinearity test and Information Gain Ratio were applied, respectively. After training, the models were evaluated on various statistical measures and compared with benchmark models. Results revealed that the proposed ensemble model outperformed Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and produced a precise and accurate map.

In recent years, flood damage has increased due to human intervention and land use and climate changes. The purpose of this study is to predict flood susceptibility in Tafresh watershed in Markazi Province, Iran based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Extremely Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning models and evaluate the performance of hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method and XGB model. For this purpose, 14 independent variables affecting flood susceptibility were prepared, also, 227 flood locations were identified as independent variables based on available information and field survey. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the models, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) parameters were used. Evaluating the efficiency of the models based on the AUCs of testing dataset showed the higher efficiency of the GA-XGB hybrid model in modeling flood susceptibility in the Tafresh watershed is compared to KNN and XGB models, and the AUC in KNN, XGB, and GA-XGB models are 0.82, 0.85, and 0.87, respectively. So using the genetic algorithm as an optimizer for determining the best parameters in the XGB model increases efficiency in this model. The results of determining the relative importance of independent variables in flood susceptibility modeling showed that the independent variables considered in each model have different effects. Distance from road and distance from river in all three models had significant importance in modeling flood hazard in the Tafresh watershed. The optimization method in this study can be used as a powerful method in other spatial modeling studies. The results of this study also support management programs to reduce flood risks in the study area.

However, many developing countries lack sufficiently detailed data to produce reliable risk maps with existing methods. Thus, improved methods are needed that can help managers and decision makers to combine existing data with more soft semi-subjective data, such as citizen observations of flood-prone and vulnerable areas in view of existing settlements. Thus, we present an innovative approach using the semi-subjective Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which integrates both subjective and objective assessments, to help organize the problem framework. This approach involves measuring the consistency of decision makersâ judgments, generating pairwise comparisons for choosing a solution, and considering criteria and subcriteria to evaluate possible options. An urban flood-risk map was created according to the vulnerabilities and hazards of different urban areas using classification and regression-tree models, and the map can serve both as a first stage in advancing flood-risk mitigation approaches and in allocating warning and forecasting systems. The findings show that machine-learning methods are efficient in urban flood zoning. Using the city Rasht in Iran, it is shown that distance to rivers, urban drainage density, and distance to vulnerable areas are the most significant parameters that influence flood hazards. Similarly, for urban flood vulnerability, population density, land use, dwelling quality, household income, distance to cultural heritage, and distance to medical centers and hospitals are the most important factors. The integrated technique for both objective and semi-subjective data as outlined in the present study shows credible results that can be obtained without complicated modeling and costly field surveys. The proposed method is especially helpful in areas with little data to describe and display flood hazards to managers and decision makers. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Flood susceptibility modeling is an indirect method for reducing flood disaster losses. This study aimed to improve flood susceptibility modeling by developing a sequential ensemble (extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) model utilizing three swarm-based algorithms (bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), cuckoo search (CS), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms). Initially, an integration of optical (Landsat-8) and radar (Sentinel-1) satellite images were used to monitor the flooded areas during the July 2022 monsoon in the Kazerun region, Iran. A total of 1358 flood occurrence points were considered from the monitored flood areas; 70% (952 points) and 30% (406 points) were used for modeling and evaluating the models, respectively. Based on flood points and thirteen spatial criteria influencing floods, four flood models ((XGBoost, XGBoost-ABC, XGBoost-BFO, and XGBoost-CS)) were used to generate a flood susceptibility map (FSM).

In this study, we present an improved Blending approach, RF-Blending (Reserve Feature Blending), which differs from the Blending approach in that it preserves the original feature dataset during meta-learner training. Our objectives were to demonstrate the performance improvement of the RF-Blending approach and to produce flash flood susceptibility maps for all catchments in Jiangxi Province using the RF-Blending approach. The Blending approach employs a double-layer structure consisting of support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest (RF) as base learners for level-0, and the output of level-0 is utilized as the meta-feature dataset for the meta-learner in level-1, which is logistic regression (LR). RF-Blending employs the output of level-0 along with the original feature dataset for meta-learner training. To develop flood susceptibility maps, we utilized these approaches in conjunction with historical flash flood points and catchment-based factors. Our results indicate that the RF-Blending approach outperformed the other approaches. These can significantly aid catchment-based flash flood susceptibility mapping and assist managers in controlling and remediating induced damages. Â© 2023 IWA Publishing.

The restoration and recovery are costly and can interrupt communitiesâ sustainable growth after the extensive flood. Flash floods (FF) are a frequent natural disaster that causes significant casualties and disrupts economic growth in the Brahmaputra River Basin (BRB). Hence, the flood susceptibility modeling of BRB is imperative. The study uses six machine learning (ML) techniques (three stand-alone such as artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), and random forest (RF), and three hybrid ensemble models (HEMs) including ANN-FL, FL-RF, and RF-ANN) to appraise flash flood Susceptibility (FFS) prediction in BRB considering 16 flash flood susceptibility factors. Area under the curve (AUC), ROC curve, confusion matrix (CM), and Friedman test are applied to assess the performance of the models. Results for the training and testing datasets showed that all HEMs models for FFS prediction in the BRB outperformed the stand-alone models. The RF-ANN has the best prediction ability of all models because the RF meta-classifier improves the ANN modelâs base-classifier precision. The RF-ANN model delineated 2908.46 km2 and 874.73 km2 areas as very high and high flood susceptible zones, whereas 995.99 km2, 702.48 km2, and 10,127.57 km2 areas were predicted as moderate, low, and very low flood susceptible zones. Slope, water, vegetation, PrC, aspect, and rainfall all make the BRB sensitive to FF, as per the analysis of InGR and PCM. This workâs accuracy of the ML HEMs used for FFS mapping is promising. Furthermore, the findings of this study may be valuable for flood prevention and management to deal with the current uncertainties and more precisely identify numerous characteristics that impact FFS. This research is helpful for policymakers because it provides information that could be utilized to develop measures to lessen the adverse effects of FF.

Flooding is one of those disasters. The coastal area of Bangladesh has higher vulnerability to flooding which is important to assess for planning and development. The study focuses on the coastal flood susceptibility through a holistic approach by combining three machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), with GIS techniques. Nine flood conditioning factors (Aspect, Slope, Elevation, Mean Sea Level, Wind, Distance from coast, Distance from river, Distance from cyclone and Geology) were considered in this study. These variables are selected by reviewing site-specific available literature and experts opinions. Relevant data were collected from several sources, and these data were analyzed in various software. The study also incorporates an analysis utilizing the best-fitted model among the three algorithms from a humanistic perspective. After obtaining results from the models, the output went under accuracy assessment to justify whether the model yielded accurate results or not. A comparative analysis to understand the suitability of these three algorithms is presented in the study, along with the delineation of five categories of flood susceptible classes of the study area. The Random Forest model was the most accurate, with an accuracy of 86.7 percent, followed by XGBoost with an accuracy of 86.3 percent and KNN with an accuracy of 85.5 percent. The Random Forest (RF) model was selected for further analysis as it yielded better accuracy incorporating the Upazila and population data. Further analysis shows that the district of Barguna, Bhola, and Patuakhali had the highest number of very high flood susceptible Upazilas among the 19 coastal districts in the study area. Around 10.63% of the study area's population, which is 4,214,084 people approximately, live in the Very High Susceptibility Zone.

In this regard, the quantitative calculation of flood susceptibility has become a very popular practice in the scientific research. With the development of modern computerized methods such as geographic information system and machine learning models, and as a result of the possibility of combining them, the determination of areas susceptible to floods has become increasingly accurate, and the algorithms used are increasingly varied. Some of the most used and highly accurate machine learning algorithms are the decision tree models. Therefore, in the present study focusing on flood susceptibility zonation mapping in the Trotus River basin, the following algorithms were applied: forest by penalizing attributeâweights of evidence (forest-PA-WOE), best first decision treeâWOE, alternating decision treeâWOE, and logistic regressionâWOE. The best performant, characterized by a maximum accuracy of 0.981, proved to be forest-PA-WOE, whereas in terms of flood exposure, an area of over 16.22% of the Trotus basin is exposed to high and very high floods susceptibility. The performances applied models in the present work are higher than the models applied in the previous studies in the same study area. Moreover, it should be noted that the accuracy of the models is similar with the accuracies of the decision tree models achieved in the studies focused on other areas across the world. Therefore, we can state that the models applied in the present research can be successfully used in by the researchers in other case studies.

One of climate change's most destructive calamities is flash flooding. On that caveat, this study tries to identify the zones most susceptible to flash floods by utilizing machine learning technique. Initially, a digital elevation model (DEM) has been utilized to delineate a basin located in the city of New Cairo, Egypt, where the flash floods occur frequently. Subsequentially, 12 flood causative factors were calculated and mapped via ArcMap. Furthermore, the depth of runoff was calculated via HEC-RAS and employed as a flood causative factor. Additionally, both flooded points and flood causative factors have been employed by utilizing the ""GARP""* approach to produce the Flood Hazard Map (FHM). The state-of-art in this study is to predict the hazard degree of flash floods by utilizing the simulated runoff depth which has been used as flood causative factor in the selected machine learning technique. The FHM anticipated approximately 20% of the total area to have a very high hazard of floods, whereas, more than two-thirds of the study area has expected to have low and very low flood hazard. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic ""ROC"" approach has been applied to examine the FHM, which estimated the area under curve as 96.88%.

In this study, a methodological framework is proposed that enables the assessment of flood hazard and risk levels of severity dynamically by fusing optical remote sensing (Sentinel-1) and GIS-based data from the region of the Trieste, Monfalcone and Muggia Municipalities. Explainable machine learning techniques were utilised, aiming to interpret the results for the assessment of flood hazard. The flood inventory was randomly divided into 70%, used for training, and 30%, employed for testing. Various combinations of the models were evaluated for the assessment of flood hazard. The results revealed that the Random Forest model achieved the highest F1-score (approx. 0.99), among others utilised for generating flood hazard maps.

This study proposes to compare and evaluate the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Shannon's Entropy (SE), and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods in the preparation of flood susceptibility mapping and assess their contextual suitability. The study has been carried out in coastal districts of West Bengal, India namely, South 24 Parganas and East Midnapur. Nine flood conditioning factors were identified and used as input parameters for the study. Each flood susceptibility map was subdivided into four categories where 27.29% of the study area were categorized as highly susceptible, while 39.45% of area were categorized as moderately susceptible to flood hazards. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Seed Cell Area Index (SCAI) were applied for accuracy assessment and validation of the selected models. AUC values for ROC curves showed that the performance of the SVM model is better than that of the AHP and SE methods. Moreover, Hot Spots analyses for identification of high flood susceptible clusters revealed that the SVM model was far superior when compared to the other two models. The factors selected for assessment of flood susceptibility in AHP and SE models could not respond to the changing scale of analyses and hence produced significant erroneous outcomes. Hence, the SVM model evolved as the most versatile method in this comparison.

The model was then used to assess the areas of highest probability of flooding. Upon its completion, we discovered that flooding may now occur with less rainfall than that of the 10-year return period.

This study designed a multi-hazard map for three important hazards (earthquakes, floods, and landslides) to identify endangered areas in Kermanshah province located in western Iran using ensemble SWARA-ANFIS-PSO and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO models. In the first step, flood and landslide inventory maps were generated to identify at-risk areas. Then, the occurrence places for each hazard were divided into two groups for training susceptibility models (70%) and testing the models applied (30%). Factors affecting these hazards, including altitude, slope aspect, slope degree, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to the faults, rainfall, lithology, and land use, were used to generate susceptibility maps. The SWARA method was used to weigh the subclasses of the influencing factors in floods and landslides. In addition, a peak ground acceleration (PGA) map was generated to investigate earthquakes in the study area. In the next step, the ANFIS machine learning algorithm was used in combination with PSO and GWO meta-heuristic algorithms to train the data, and SWARA-ANFIS-PSO and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO susceptibility maps were separately generated for flood and landslide hazards. The predictive ability of the implemented models was validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean square error (MSE) methods. The results showed that the SWARA-ANFIS-PSO ensemble model had the best performance in generating flood susceptibility maps with ROC = 0.936, RMS = 0.346, and MSE = 0.120.

For this work, sixteen flood controlling factors were applied. These predisposing factors were chosen based on field knowledge, previous researchs, and data availability. The FSMs were produced for the better palling and management of natural resources of Kunur River Basin, applying one deep learning model (DLM) includes convolution neural network (CNN) model and three benchmark machine learning methods (BMLMs) including multilayer perceptron (MLP), Bagging, and random forest (RF). The differences in prediction capacity between the models were assessed by applying the Friedman rank test and Wilcoxon test. Performance of the FSMs, evaluated through the precision, accuracy, AUC (area under the curve), and statistical measures revealed that CNN has the highest AUC values (0.934) followed by MLP (0.927), Bagging (0.897), and RF (0.900) respectively. The CNN modelâs prediction capacity is slightly better than Bagging, RF, and MLP models.

However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, multi-hazard susceptibility prediction techniques based on machine learning has encountered a huge bottleneck. In order to effectively solve this problem, this study proposes a multi-hazard susceptibility mapping framework using the classical deep learning algorithm of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). First, we use historical flash flood, debris flow and landslide locations based on Google Earth images, extensive field surveys, topography, hydrology, and environmental data sets to train and validate the proposed CNN method. Next, the proposed CNN method is assessed in comparison to conventional logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor methods using several objective criteria, i.e., coefficient of determination, overall accuracy, mean absolute error and the root mean square error. Experimental results show that the CNN method outperforms the conventional machine learning algorithms in predicting probability of flash floods, debris flows and landslides. Finally, the susceptibility maps of the three hazards based on CNN are combined to create a multi-hazard susceptibility map. It can be observed from the map that 62.43% of the study area are prone to hazards, while 37.57% of the study area are harmless. In hazard-prone areas, 16.14%, 4.94% and 30.66% of the study area are susceptible to flash floods, debris flows and landslides, respectively.

However, flood inventory data acquired from historical flooding records and field surveys in existing studies are sparse and not enough to develop accurate machine learning models. Thus, we developed a hybrid approach that integrates hydrodynamic model (HEC-HMS/RAS), rapid flood model (height above the nearest drainage, HAND) and machine learning model (random forest, RF) for flood susceptibility assessment. The proposed approach was then implemented in the Xinluo watershed, a flood-prone mountainous catchment in China. The results showed that the spatially continuous flood inventory map generated from HEC-HMS/RAS model satisfies the big data requirements of the RF model, and the proposed hybrid approach demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency in flood susceptibility assessment with overall accuracy and area under the ROC curve values of 0.915 and 0.912, respectively.

In many countries, sustainable environmental management requires the assessment of floods and the likely flood-prone areas to avoid potential hazards. In this study, the performance and capabilities of seven machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for flood susceptibility mapping were tested, evaluated, and compared. These MLAs, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), boosted regression tree (BRT), functional data analysis (FDA), general linear model (GLM), and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), were tested for the area between Safaga and Ras Gharib cities, Red Sea, Egypt. A geospatial database was developed with eleven flood-related factors, namely altitude, slope aspect, lithology, land use/land cover (LULC), slope length (LS), topographic wetness index (TWI), slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, stream power index (SPI), and hydrolithology units. In addition, 420 actual flooded areas were recorded from the study area to create a flood inventory map. The inventory data were randomly divided into training group with 70% and validation group with 30%. The flood-related factors were tested with a multicollinearity test, the variance inflation factor (VIF) was less than 2.135, the tolerance (TOL) was more than 0.468, and their importance was evaluated with a partial least squares (PLS) method. The results show that RF performed the best with the highest AUC (area under curve) value of 0.813, followed by GLM with 0.802, MARS with 0.801, BRT with 0.777, MDA with 0.768%, FDA with 0.763, and SVM with 0.733. The results of this study and the flood susceptibility maps could be useful for environmental mitigation, future development activities in the area, and flood control areas.

The first stage of the manuscript consisted of the collection and processing of the geodatabase needed in the present study. The geodatabase comprises a number of 14 flood predictors and 132 known flood locations. The Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) method was used in order to assess the prediction capacity of the 14 predictors in terms of flood susceptibility estimation. The training and validation of the three ensemble models constitute the next stage of the scientific workflow. Several statistical metrics and ROC curve method were involved in the evaluation of the model's performance and accuracy. According to ROC curves all the models achieved high performances since their AUC had values above 0.89. ICO-DLNN-FR proved to be the most accurate model (AUC = 0.959).

The perfomance of these three methods was assessed in order to select the best method for flood vulnerability mapping in densely urbanized city. Thus, initially, thirteen flood predictors were evaluated using the information gain ratio (IGR), and eight most important predictors were considered from model training and testing. The performance of the applied models and accuracy of the result was evaluated through the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical measures. By using the testing dataset, the result reveals that DLNN (AUC = 0.877) is the more performant model in comparison to ANN (AUC = 0.851) and BLR (AUC = 0.697).

The class imbalance issue and the magnitude of the imbalance was explored in this study to highlight the uncertain nature of the flooding phenomenon. Therefore, the Random Forest (RF) was initially adopted to evaluate five imbalance class distribution scenarios (i.e., 1x, 10x, 25x, 50x, 100x non-flood events, for each x flood event). Parameter configurations of developed models were determined with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic, the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. The CS-RF model showed the highest (0.8455) prediction capability with regards to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) once the extent of imbalance was set as 50x. The CS-RF model was then benchmarked with another bagging, i.e., Extra Trees, and two boosting, i.e., Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, all integrated with the CS technique. Analysis results showed that the CS-RF is the most promising tree-based machine learning technique in flash flood susceptibility projection for the selected study area. According to the predictions, a flash flood susceptibility map was generated, where 9.35% of the basin was under very high flash flood risk. A recently developed model-agnostic game-theoretical method, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), was used for anatomizing the flash flood conditioning factors to highlight the contribution of each feature on the incident outcome prediction ensuring the transparency of the model findings. Overall, this study contributes to both theory and practice with particular focus on the model interpretability and existence of imbalance in the occurrence of flash flood events, assisting decision-makers in enhancing strategies to combat hazardous impacts of floods.

Several approaches for identifying flood-prone locations have been developed to reduce the overall harmful impacts on humans and the environment. However, due to the increased frequency of flooding and related disasters, coupled with the continuous changes in natural and social-economic conditions, it has become vital to predict areas with the highest probability of flooding to ensure effective measures to mitigate impending disasters. This study predicted the flood susceptible areas in Nigeria based on historical flood records from 1985~2020 and various conditioning factors. To evaluate the link between flood incidence and the fifteen (15) explanatory variables, which include climatic, topographic, land use and proximity information, the artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR) models were trained and tested to develop a flood susceptibility map. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate both model accuracies. The results show that both techniques can model and predict flood-prone areas. However, the ANN model produced a higher performance and prediction rate than the LR model, 76.4% and 62.5%, respectively. In addition, both models highlighted that those areas with the highest susceptibility to flood are the low-lying regions in the southern extremities and around water areas. From the study, we can establish that machine learning techniques can effectively map and predict flood-prone areas and serve as a tool for developing flood mitigation policies and plans.

Due to its geographical setup, mitigation and management of floods are challenging and hard to execute. One of the tools used in managing the events is âflood susceptibility mapping,â in which an incident probability as well as a rescue path is estimated and planned. To create one, the traditional GIS method called FRAM (flood risk assessment model), combined with AHP (analytical hierarchy process), is used and implemented on ArcGIS software. In this method, we first created a comparison table to compute weights for each of the selected factors. Then the computed weights were used in the FRAM model in ArcGIS to create a flood susceptibility map for each region. Each region was then classified as very high, high, medium, low, and very low risk. On the other hand, in computer science, machine learning and AI are prevalent and being adopted to various domains, promising the effectiveness of the method, potentially beat the forementioned traditional method. Therefore, ANN (artificial neural network) is adopted in this work to create the flood susceptibility map. The ANN technique is developed by using causal factors. The ANN classifies areas as either flood areas or flood-free areas. The 2 methods from different disciplines (GIS and Computer Science) are applied and described in this paper with the intention to prove whether the machine learning is really efficient and can outperform the traditional GIS approach. Data on Thailandâ s Ayutthaya Province is used in this work as a case study-in order to assess flood prone areas and compared for performance evaluation. Both of which use the 6 selected factors according to the literature: (i) flow accumulation, (ii) elevation, (iii) land use, (iv) rainfall intensity, (v) slope and (vi) soil types. The results from the 2 methods were verified with historical flood data and compared. The results showed that ANN (obtained via sensitivity analysis) outperformed the FRAM with precision of 79.90 %, recall of 79.04 %, F1-score of 79.08 % and accuracy of 79.31 %. In addition, we found that (according to our ANN experiments) the main causal factors related to flood susceptibility map only included 3 factors: flow accumulation, elevation, and soil types. Therefore, the proposed methodology for assessment of flood susceptibility areas using these 3 factors could be considered sufficient and applied to other regions in related applications, when needed.

Flood risk management in many countries employs flood susceptibility modeling to mitigate against the damage to the economy and loss of life caused by future floods. The objective of this study is the development of a new approach based on the machine learning algorithms namely Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AOA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA), Decision Tree (DT), and Adaboost (ADB) to build flood susceptibility maps for the Nhat LeâKien Giang watershed of Quang Binh province. In total, 1964 flood locations and 14 conditioning factors were split with a ratio of 70:30 for the training model and the validation model respectively. Various statistical indices â namely root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) â were used to evaluate the models. The results show that all the models performed well in building the flood susceptibility map, with an AUC value of more 0.9; the models MLP-WCA (AUC = 0.99) and MLP-AOA (AUC = 0.99) were most successful, followed by MLP-WOA (AUC = 0.98), MLP-ACO (0.98), ADB (0.98), and DT (0.97). The analysis of the flood susceptibility maps shows that the high and very high susceptibility level corresponds to no more than 39% of the study area. The results also show that altitude, slope, rainfall, and land use are most influential on the probability of flood occurrence in the study area. It can be concluded that the machine learning models proposed in this study provide results with high accuracy. The flood susceptibility maps that have been produced will be significant in determining future development strategies, especially in selecting the locations of new urban areas; and the findings of this study may be applied not only to this particular watershed in Vietnam, but also in developing countries around the world.

Flood risk mapping is a key tool in flood management. However, it is computationally expensive to produce flood risk maps using hydrodynamic models. To this end, this paper investigates the use of machine learning for the assessment of surface water flood risks in urban areas. The factors that are considered in machine learning models include coordinates, elevation, slope gradient, imperviousness, land use, land cover, soil type, substrate, distance to river, distance to road, and normalized difference vegetation index. The machine learning models are tested using the case study of Exeter, UK. The performance of machine learning algorithms, including naÃ¯ve Bayes, perceptron, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is compared based on a spectrum of indicators, e.g., accuracy, F-beta score, and receiver operating characteristic curve. The results obtained from the case study show that the flood risk maps can be accurately generated by the machine learning models. The performance of models on the 30-year flood event is better than 100-year and 1000-year flood events. The CNNs and ANNs outperform the other machine learning algorithms tested.

Similarly to many parts of the globe, particularly the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey is frequently exposed to major floods. The heavy rainfall and topographic structure of the region and the proximity of settlements to stream beds are the primary causes of flooding. The present study pertains to the utilization of the Logistic Regression (LR), M5P Rule Tree (M5PRT) and M5P Regression Tree (M5PRGT) models for the assessment of the flood hazard areas in and around the Of district, located on the Black Sea coast of Trabzon province. According to flood inventory, 16 flood events occurred in 5 different locations in the study area. These areas were converted into point data, and comprising a total of 1600 points, 800 flooded and 800 non-flooded, were determined by random sampling. Accordingly, flood hazard maps were created with 8 flood parameters and 3 different methods. Accuracies of these models were evaluated through AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve), ACC (Accuracy), R (Recall), P (Precision) and F (F-Score). Analyses showed that the Tree-Based Algorithms are more successful than the LR method in detecting the flood hazards. In addition, the altitude and precipitation were found out to be the most influential parameters in all 3 methods on the occurrence of flooding events in the region. The confluence points of the streams, the coastal plain where the stream disembogues to the sea and the valley floors in and around the Of district were designated as the areas with high risk of flooding.

For this, the main aim of the current research is to synthesize the three natural resources (groundwater, wetland, and forest) into one multi-resource (MR) potentiality map and three natural hazards (flood, landslide, and shoreline erosion) into one multi-hazard (MH) susceptibility map. To achieve this goal, several inventories, geo-environmental factors, satellite bands, and indices have been taken as input data sets. Random forest (RF) model has been considered for individual mapping (except shoreline erosion mapping) due to its high precision. For shoreline erosion mapping, digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) model has been employed. The accuracies of the model have been determined from the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, producer accuracy (PA), and user accuracy (UA). RF model has more than 90% prediction accuracy in different resource and hazard mapping, whereas for the forest mapping, PA and UA are 90% and 80%, respectively. The results of this study for multi-resource mapping show forest (24.05%) and groundwater (22.28%) as the major resources, whereas flood (17.27%) is the most destructive in comparison with other hazards.

This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap through the development and comparative performance of these models. This approach created the flood inventory map using satellite images and field observations. A geodatabase was used to create flood predictors such as aspect, altitude, distance to rivers, topographic wetness index (TWI), flow accumulation, lithology, distance to road, land use, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope, rainfall, soil type, Topographic Position Index (TPI), and Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI). The developed models were trained using 80% of the data and evaluated using the remaining 20% to create a flood susceptibility map. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the map's accuracy. The results of this study indicated that the traditional (Elastic-net Classifier) model possessed high accuracy (AUC = 0.9457, F1 = 0.8916, Sensitivity = 0.9024, and Precision = 0.881) than the ensemble algorithm (Light Gradient Boosting on Elastic-net Predictions) (AUC = 0.9629, F1 = 0.9538, Sensitivity = 0.9688, and Precision = 0.9394). Based on the results of this study it can be concluded that these algorithms has a strong potential to offer a practical and affordable method for geospatial modeling of flood vulnerability. This information can be used to assess the flood emergency, early warning system and provide insights for planning and response purposes.

This study developed a framework for evaluating flood susceptibility in the GBA using tree-based machine learning (ML) and geographical information system techniques. Based on the flood inventory, tree-based models, namely random forest, gradient boost decision tree, extreme gradient boosting, and categorical boosting considering topography, exposure, and vulnerability as influential factors, were used to train and test ML models, and the trained models were then used to predict flood susceptibility. All tree-based ML models achieved good performance, with accuracy values greater than 0.79. The categorical boosting model performed the best than other models to predict flood susceptibility. The flood susceptibility maps showed that more than 16% of the areas of the GBA were classified as having high flood susceptibility, and almost 70% of the historical floods were located in areas with high flood susceptibility. The model interpretation of the summary of Shapley additive explanation values indicated that the influential factors of elevation, population density, and typhoon intensity had a strong influence on flood susceptibility. The obtained spatial flood susceptibilities provide suggestions for flood disaster mitigation in the GBA.

Therefore, integration of deep learning â an updated version of machine learning techniques â and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) models can generate high-resolution flood risk maps. In this study, a novel integrated approach has been developed based on multiplicative long short-term memory (mLSTM) deep learning models and an MCDM ensemble model to map flood risk in the Minab-Shamil plain, southern Iran. A flood hazard map generated by the mLSTM model is based on nine critical features selected by GrootCV (distance to the river, vegetation cover, variables extracted from DEM (digital elevation model) and river density) and a flood inventory map (70% and 30% data were randomly selected as training and test datasets, respectively). The values of all criteria used to assess model accuracy performance (except Cohens kappa for train dataset = 86, and for test dataset = 84) achieved values greater than 90, which indicates that the mLSTM model performed very well for the generation of a spatial flood hazard map. According to the spatial flood hazard map produced by mLSTM, the very low, low, moderate, high and very high classes cover 26%, 35.3%, 20.5%, 11.2% and 7% of the total area, respectively. Flood vulnerability maps were produced by the combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS), the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS), and the multi-objective optimization on the basis of simple ratio analysis (MOOSRA), and then validated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (SRC). Based on the SRC, the three models CODAS, EDAS, and MOOSRA showed high-ranking correlations with each other, and all three models were then used in the ensemble process. According to the CODAS-EDAS-MOOSRA ensemble model, 21.5%, 34.2%, 23.7%, 13%, and 7.6% of the total area were classified as having a very low to very high flood vulnerability, respectively. Finally, a flood risk map was generated by the combination of flood hazard and vulnerability maps produced by the mLSTM and MCDM ensemble model. According to the flood risk map, 27.4%, 34.3%, 14.8%, 15.7%, and 7.8% of the total area were classified as having a very low, low, moderate, high, and very high flood risk, respectively. Overall, the integration of mLSTM and the MCDM ensemble is a promising tool for generating precise flood risk maps and provides a useful reference for flood risk management.

It causes considerable impact on human life, the environment, and property, worldwide. Building a highly accurate flood susceptibility map can reduce disaster damage; it has become the main approach in flood risk management. The objective of this research is to build flood susceptibility maps for Binh Dinh province in Vietnam, applying modern machine learning and remote sensing methods, namely deep neural networks (DNN) and swarm-based optimization algorithms such as aquila optimizer algorithm (AO), sea lion optimization (SLnO), elephant herding optimization (EHO), the naked mole-rat algorithm (NMRA), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The geospatial distribution analysis approach was used to construct the input data, including 1883 sample points and 12 conditioning factors. Several well-known algorithms were used as reference models to compare the accuracy of each proposed model. The statistical indices root mean square error (RMSE), area under curve (AUC), mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy, and F1 score were used to validate the proposed model. The results show that five optimization algorithms successfully in buiding flood susceptibility maps and these models performed well with an AUC value of more than 0.97. The DNN-NMRA model came first (RMSE = 0.16, AUC = 0.99), followed by DNN-SLnO (RMSE = 0.39, AUC = 0.99), DNN-EHO (RMSE = 0.41, AUC = 0.99), DNN-AO (RMSE = 0.46, AUC = 0.97), and DNN-SGD (RMSE = 0.49, AUC = 0.93) respectively. Furthermore, the results show that the precision of new models (DNN-NMRA, DNN-SlnO, DNN-EHO, DNN-AO) surpassed the standard model DNN-SGD. The results of this study are useful in the construction of appropriate flood management strategies in at-risk regions.

Machine learning methods have been widely applied in flood susceptibility modeling, but traditional supervised learning requires both positive (flood) and negative (non-flood) samples in model training. Historical flood inventory data usually contain positive-only data, whereas negative data selected from areas without flood records are prone to be contaminated by positive data, which is referred to as case-control sampling with contaminated controls. In order to address this problem, we propose to apply a novel positive-unlabeled learning algorithm, namely positive and background learning with constraints (PBLC), in flood susceptibility modeling. PBLC trains a binary classifier from case-control positive and unlabeled samples without requiring truly labeled negative data. With historical records of flood locations and environmental covariates, including elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, slope length factor, stream power index, topographic position index, topographic wetness index, distance to rivers, distance to roads, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, and precipitation, we compared the performances of the traditional artificial neural network (ANN) and the novel PBLC in flood susceptibility modeling in the city of Guangzhou, China. Experimental results show that PBLC can produce more calibrated probabilistic prediction, more accurate binary prediction, and more reliable susceptibility mapping of urban flooding than traditional ANN, indicating that PBLC is effective in addressing the problem of case-control sampling with contaminated controls and it can be successfully applied in urban flood susceptibility mapping.

The study was conducted for two watersheds in Canada, namely Lower Nicola River, BC and Loup, QC. Three statistical metrics were used to validate the models: Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, Figure of Merit, and F1-score. Findings indicated that the RF model had the highest accuracy in providing the flood susceptibility maps (FSMs). Moreover, the provided FSMs indicated that flooding is more likely to occur in the Lower Nicola River watershed than the Loup watershed. Following the RCP4.5 scenario, the area percentages of the flood susceptibility classes in the Loup watershed in 2050 and 2080 have changed by the following percentages from the year 2020 and 2050, respectively: Very Low = â1.68%, Low = â5.82%, Moderate = +6.19%, High = +0.71%, and Very High = +0.6% and Very Low = â1.61%, Low = +2.98%, Moderate = â3.49%, High = +1.29%, and Very High = +0.83%. Likewise, in the Lower Nicola River watershed, the changes between the years 2020 and 2050 and between the years 2050 and 2080 were: Very Low = â0.38%, Low = â0.81%, Moderate = â0.95%, High = +1.72%, and Very High = +0.42% and Very Low = â1.31%, Low = â1.35%, Moderate = â1.81%, High = +2.37%, and Very High = +2.1%, respectively. The impact of climate changes on future flood-prone places revealed that the regions designated as highly and very highly susceptible to flooding, grow in the forecasts for both watersheds.

These types of floods are mostly associated with landslides and erosion of roads within a short time.Most of Vietnamis hilly and mountainous; thus, the problem due to flash flood is severe and requires systematic studies to correctly identify flood susceptible areas for proper landuse planning and traffic management. In this study, three Machine Learning (ML) methods namely Deep Learning Neural Network (DL), Correlation-based Feature Weighted Naive Bayes (CFWNB), and Adaboost (AB-CFWNB) were used for the development of flash flood susceptibility maps for hilly road section (115 km length) of National Highway (NH)-6 inHoa Binh province, Vietnam. In the proposedmodels, 88 past flash flood events were used together with 14 flash floods affecting topographical and geo-environmental factors. The performance of themodels was evaluated using standard statisticalmeasures including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, Area Under Curve (AUC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results revealed that all the models performed well (AUC > 0.80) in predicting flash flood susceptibility zones, but the performance of the DL model is the best (AUC: 0.972, RMSE: 0.352). Therefore, the DL model can be applied to develop an accurate flash flood susceptibility map of hilly terrain which can be used for proper planning and designing of the highways and other infrastructure facilities besides landuse management of the area.

This paper reports a comprehensive study on flood vulnerability of flood prone areas in residential areas of the Tajan watershed, Iran in two periods before 2006 and after 2006. Flood prone area were determined by the random forest (RF) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine learning methods. To reduce time and cost, the vulnerability was assessed only in areas with very high flood hazard using 4 main criteria (social, policy, economic, infrastructure), 40 items, and 210 questionnaires across 40 villages. Independent t-test, Kruskal-Wallis, and paired t-test were used for statistical analysis of questionnaire data. The results of machine learning models (MLMs) showed that the RF model with AUC = 0.92% is more accurate in determining flood prone areas. The results of paired t-test showed that the three criteria of social (mean P1 = 2.97 and P2 = 3.35), infrastructure (mean P1 = 2.88 and P2 = 3.25), and policy (mean P1 = 3.02 and P2 = 3.50) had significant changes in both periods.

The results of the t-test also showed a decrease in vulnerability in the second period (before 2006) compared to the first period (after 2006), so the number of sub-watersheds in the very high vulnerability class was more in the first period than in the second period.

However, the unavailability of multi-domain and multi-dimensional input data and expensive computational resources limit its application in resource-constrained regions. The fifth and sixth IPCC assessment reports recommend including vulnerability and exposure components along with hazards for capturing risk on human-environment systems from natural and anthropogenic sources. In this context, the present study showcases a novel flood risk mapping approach that considers a combination of geomorphic flood descriptor (GFD)-based flood susceptibility and often neglected socio-economic vulnerability components. Three popular Machine Learning (ML) models, namely Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient-boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), are evaluated for their abilities to combine digital terrain model-derived GFDs for quantifying flood susceptibility in a flood-prone district, Jagatsinghpur, located in the lower Mahanadi River basin, India. The area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) along with Cohen's kappa are used to identify the best ML model. It is observed that the RF model performs better compared to the other two models on both training and testing datasets, with AUC score of 0.88 on each. The socio-economic vulnerability assessment follows an indicator-based approach by employing the Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR) model of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), an efficient non-parametric ranking method. It combines the district's relevant socio-economic sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators. The flood risk classes at the most refined administrative scale, i.e., village level, are determined with the Jenks natural breaks algorithm using flood susceptibility and socio-economic vulnerability scores estimated by the RF and CCR-DEA models, respectively. It was observed that >40 % of the villages spread over Jagatsinghpur face high and very high flood risk. The proposed novel framework is generic and can be used to derive a wide variety of flood susceptibility, vulnerability, and subsequently risk maps under a data-constrained scenario. Furthermore, since this approach is relatively data and computationally parsimonious, it can be easily implemented over large regions. The exhaustive flood maps will facilitate effective flood control and floodplain planning.

Machine learning is an optional assessment method because of its high objectivity and computational efficiency, but how to get enough and accurate information of historical flood locations to train the machine learning models has been a key problem. In recent years, news media data from both news websites and social media accounts has emerged as a promising source for natural science studies. However, the application of news media data in urban flood susceptibility assessment is still inadequate. This study proposed an approach to fill this gap. Firstly, flood locations were extracted from news media data based on a named entity recognition (NER) model. Then, a frequency or distance-based data quality control method was employed to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations. Finally, flood conditioning factors with information of historical flood locations were input into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for flood susceptibility assessment. We took the central city of Dalian, China as a case study. The T-test results show that there was no significant difference between the distributions of most flood conditioning factors at the flood locations from the news media data and the official planning report. In the obtained flood susceptibility map, the high flood susceptibility areas got a recall of 90% compared with the high flood hazard areas in the planning report. Performing data quality control in the frequency-based method can improve the precision of the flood susceptibility map by up to 5%, while the distance-based method is ineffective. This study provides an example and offers the value of applying new data sources and modern deep learning techniques for urban flood management.

In this paper, the effects of landslides and floods in Wadi Dawqah in Bahah region, Saudi Arabia, are studied. Mountainous regions are exposed to natural hazards that require modeling to produce multi-hazard maps. Three models were used in this study: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). Seventeen influencing factors are used to map multi-hazards using inventory data. The effectiveness and significance of the factors were determined for both landslides and floods. Model results were compared using area under the curve (AUC), overall hazard accuracy, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and kappa index. The results show that RF has the best performance in predicting landslides with a high AUC of 94.9%, while SVM, LR, and RF have high prediction for floods (AUC of 92.7%, 98%, and 98.7%, respectively). Since RF has the highest values for both landslides and floods, other statistical comparisons show that the overall accuracy is 94% and 99%, the kappa index is 0.870 and 0.978, the MAE values are 0.064 and 0.010, and finally the RMSE values are 0.253 and 0.10 for landslides and floods, respectively.

However, it is usually not known which areas and cities are particularly vulnerable to flooding caused by heavy rain. To enable regional-scale susceptibility assessment, we developed a novel methodology based on tree-based classifiers that considers both spatially distributed and catchment-related influencing factors. The performance of the developed methodology was evaluated using the region of Bavaria (Germany). For the case study area (70,500 km2), we trained a Random Forest (RF), a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and a CatBoost model (CB) using 1,864 flood and non-flood locations and 11 spatially distributed and six catchment-related influencing factors. Regarding performance metrics, all three models performed equally well (CB: AUC = 0.819, RF: AUC = 0.816, GBDT: AUC = 0.813), with the CatBoost model performing best. When modeling large areas, it proved critical to account for low sample density by ensuring (i) a homogeneous spatial coverage of the study area and (ii) the representation of the major landscapes in the training and test set. In addition, we propose an overall susceptibility score for cities based on the susceptibility map generated, which can be used to prioritize cities for detailed investigations. Those responsible for spatial planning and flood risk management can apply the proposed methodology to obtain a pluvial and flash flood susceptibility assessment for large territories.

Predicting and mapping pluvial flood-prone areas is becoming a crucial step in flood mitigation and early warnings, as well as climate change adaptation strategies, to be incorporate in urban planning. Most commonly applied machine learning (ML) procedures for pluvial flood risk assessment, neglect to account for spatio-temporal constraints, leading to overoptimistic models that underestimate the prediction error. In this paper, we propose a novel ML-based methodology for pluvial flood risk prediction in the Metropolitan City of Venice which, introducing a features selection process and spatio-temporal cross-validation, permits to reduce overfitting of the resulting ML models. Spatio-temporal characteristics of floods are derived from a dataset of 60 historical events occurred in the area between 1995 and 2020. Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forest (RF) models are applied to identify and prioritize sub-areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood risk, considering the daily precipitation amount and 12 different triggering factors. The models were validated using Random Cross-Validation (R-CV) and Leave Location and Time Out cross-validation (LLTO-CV), that split data in training and validation set considering both time and space. In addition, a forward features selection procedure was applied to identify the features, among the triggering factors, that better face spatio-temporal overfitting in pluvial flood prediction based on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score. Results suggest that Logistic Regression and LLTO-CV represent the most reliable model to predict pluvial flood events in new spatio-temporal conditions, while, among the triggering factors, distance to river and distance to road resulted the prominent ones.

The framework of the study comprises two major steps: prediction of geo-hydrological hazard-prone locations (Step-1: hazard/non-hazard), and classification of geo-hydrological hazards by identifying the locations of floods and landslides separately (Step-2: floods/landslides). We used 1326 historically experienced hazard locations (i.e., 726 for floods and 690 for landslides) in the Kentucky River basin, United States, along with the 13 hazard conditioning factors. Extremely randomized trees (ERT) coupled with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) was adopted to provide an effective classification scheme. Based on the predictions of the ERT-PSO in the first step, correctly classified hazard instances were used in the second step of the prediction task to further deepen the machine learning application. The results revealed a strong agreement between the predicted and observed hazard locations with an AUROC of 0.8032 and 0.8845 for geo-hydrological hazard (Step-1) and flood/landslide classifications (Step-2), respectively. The proposed hybrid prediction framework introduced considerably accurate performance as 73.78% and 72.91% of the hazard and non-hazard classes were correctly identified at Step-1, respectively, while at Step-2, 72.31% of the flooding points and 84.85% of the landslide points were ascertained accurately. Overall findings emerged from Step-1 illustrated that nearly 10% of the entire basin is susceptible to geo-hydrological hazards with very high probability, whereas very low susceptible areas cover only 20% of the basin. A model-agnostic game-theory based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was employed to anatomize the contribution of hazard conditioning factors on the incident outcome predictions aiding to increase the interpretability of the adopted methodology. The holistic approach adopted in the present research has significant potential in providing insights into the practical and theoretical grounds of the literature.

Remote sensing devices are becoming increasingly important in monitoring and assessing natural disaster susceptibility and hazards. The proposed research work pursues an assessment analysis of flood susceptibility in a tropical desert environment: a case study of Yemen. The base data for this research were collected and organized from meteorological, satellite images, remote sensing data, essential geographic data, and various data sources and used as input data into four machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this study, RS data (Sentinel-1 images) were used to detect flooded areas in the study area. We also used the Sentinel application platform (SNAP 7.0) for Sentinel-1 image analysis and detecting flood zones in the study locations. Flood spots were discovered and verified using Google Earth images, Landsat images, and press sources to create a flood inventory map of flooded areas in the study area. Four ML algorithms were used to map flash flood susceptibility (FFS) in Tarim city (Yemen): K-nearest neighbor (KNN), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), random forests (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Twelve flood conditioning factors were prepared, assessed in multicollinearity, and used with flood inventories as input parameters to run each model. A total of 600 random flood and non-flood points were chosen, where 75% and 25% were used as training and validation datasets. The confusion matrix and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were used to validate the susceptibility maps. The results obtained reveal that all models had a high capacity to predict floods (AUC > 0.90). Further, in terms of performance, the tree-based ensemble algorithms (RF, XGBoost) outperform other ML algorithms, where the RF algorithm provides robust performance (AUC = 0.982) for assessing flood-prone areas with only a few adjustments required prior to training the model. The value of the research lies in the fact that the proposed models are being tested for the first time in Yemen to assess flood susceptibility, which can also be used to assess, for example, earthquakes, landslides, and other disasters. Furthermore, this work makes significant contributions to the worldwide effort to reduce the risk of natural disasters, particularly in Yemen. This will, therefore, help to enhance environmental sustainability.

This research applies stacking and blending ensemble learning approaches to assess the flash flood potential in Jiangxi, China. Four base models â linear regression, K-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, and random forest â are adopted to build the two ensemble models. All models are evaluated by three metrics (accuracy, true positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and compared with a Bayesian approach. The results suggest that the blending approach is superior to all the other models, which has then been selected to evaluate the vulnerability of flash floods for all the catchments in Jiangxi. The derived maps of flash flood susceptibility suggest that over half of the province, in terms of either area or the number of catchments, are prone to flash floods, in particular the north, northeast and south.

Our study addresses these open problems by considering two separate issues: (1) mapping flood-prone areas and (2) predicting the expected water depth for a given inundation scenario. We blend seven geomorphic descriptors through decision tree models trained on target FH maps, referring to a large study area (? 105 km2). We discuss the potential of multivariate approaches relative to the performance of a selected univariate model and on the basis of multiple extrapolation experiments, where models are tested outside their training region.

The primary variables considered in most of these works include terrain models, lithology, river networks and land use. While several recent studies include average annual rainfall and/or temperature, other meteorological information such as snow accumulation and short-term intense rain events that may influence the hydrology of the area under investigation have not been considered. Notably, in Canada, most inland flooding occurs during the freshet, due to the melting of an accumulated snowpack coupled with heavy rainfall. Therefore, in this study the impact of several climate variables along with various hydro-geomorphological (HG) variables were tested to determine the impact of their inclusion. Three tests were run: only HG variables, the addition of annual average temperature and precipitation (HG-PT), and the inclusion of six other meteorological datasets (HG-8M) on five study areas across Canada. In HG-PT, both precipitation and temperature were selected as important in every study area, while in HG-8M a minimum of three meteorological datasets were considered important in each study area. Notably, as the meteorological variables were added, many of the initial HG variables were dropped from the selection set. The accuracy, F1, true skill and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were marginally improved when the meteorological data was added to the a parallel random forest algorithm (parRF). When the model is applied to new data, the estimated accuracy of the prediction is higher in HG-8M, indicating that inclusion of relevant, local meteorological datasets improves the result.

An adverse events like floods, wildfires, cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc., are regarded as a natural disaster once it strikes the vulnerable population areas. An early tracking of susceptibility areas and immediate tracking of affected areas might help in facilitating rescue and early warnings to the public. To achieve autonomous natural disaster prediction, this paper makes use of current developments in remote sensing, which speed up the availability of aerial/satellite data and are reinforced by progress in the computing sector. The aerial/satellite imageries are employed for acquiring the data from areas of Queensland-Australia that are more prone to natural disaster in an eagle-eye perspective. Since there were several techniques employed so far for the automatic prediction of natural disaster susceptibilities, there were some limitations like reduced rate of accuracy and so on. So as to overcome these limitations, deep learning based automated process is employed for predicting the natural disaster areas and probability of event occurrences. The main intention of the work is to detect the natural disaster occurrence from the sensed data which aids in providing warning to public and to safeguard them by taking necessary actions. Initially, remote sensing data is pre-processed and the features are extracted using Adaptive linear Internal embedding algorithm-based feature extraction (ALIE-FE). The extracted features are selected using Recursive Wrapper-based feature subset selection. To estimate best fitness function and to enhance the prediction accuracy, the optimization process is carried using Bio-Inspired Squirrel Search Optimization algorithm (BI-SSOA). Finally, the classification is carried by means of Deep learning based Multi-layer Alex Net classifier (DBMLA) approach. The simulation is carried and the outcomes attained are estimated for predicting flood susceptibility and wildfire susceptibility. The proposed BISSOA-DBMLA offers sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 99%, and TSS of 97%. The proposed system offers 98.99% classification accuracy. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, TSS, and area under the curve (AUC) are used to evaluate the efficacy of the suggested system in light of the achieved results from other approaches.

They also slow down a countryâs economy. Due to the dynamic and complex nature of floods, it is difficult to predict the areas that are prone to flooding. In this study, an attempt was made to create a suitability map for future urban development based on flood vulnerability maps for the catchment area of Taif, Saudi Arabia. Three models were used for this purpose, including bivariate (FR), multivariate (LR), and machine learning (SVM) were used. Thirteen parameters were used as flood-contributing parameters. The inventory map was constructed using field surveys, historical data, analysis of RADAR (Sentinel-1A), and Google Earth imagery collected between 2013 and 2020. In general, 70% flood locations were randomly selected from the flood inventory map to generate the flood susceptibility model, and the remaining 30% of the flood locations were used for model validation. The flood susceptibility map was classified into five zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The AUC value used to predict the performance of the models showed that the accuracy reached 89.5, 92.0, and 96.2% for the models FR, LR, and SVM, respectively. Accordingly, the flood susceptibility map produced by the SVM model is accurate and was used to produce a flood vulnerability map with the help of urban and road density maps. Then slope and elevation maps were integrated with the flood vulnerability model to produce the final suitability map, which was classified into three zones: isolated zone, low suitability, and high suitability areas. The results showed that the highly suitable areas are located in the east and northeast of the Taif Basin, where the flood risk is low and very low. The results of this work will improve the land use planning of engineers and authorities and take possible measures to reduce the flood hazards in the area.

Flood susceptibility maps were created using ML techniques. AHP was utilized to combine flood vulnerability and exposure criteria. We selected Quang Binh province of Vietnam as a case study and collected available data, including 696 flooding locations of historical flooding events in 2007, 2010, 2016, and 2020; and flood influencing factors of elevation, slope, curvature, flow direction, flow accumulation, distance from river, river density, land cover, geology, and rainfall. These data were used to construct training and testing datasets. The susceptibility models were validated and compared using statistical techniques. An integrated flood risk assessment framework was proposed to incorporate flood hazard (flood susceptibility), flood exposure (distance from river, land use, population density, and rainfall), and flood vulnerability (poverty rate, number of freshwater stations, road density, number of schools, and healthcare facilities). Model validation suggested that deep learning has the best performance of AUCÂ =Â 0.984 compared with other ensemble models of MultiBoostAB Ensemble (0.958), Random SubSpace Ensemble (0.962), and credal decision tree (AUCÂ =Â 0.918). The final flood risk map shows 5075Â ha (0.63%) in extremely high risk, 47,955Â ha (5.95%) in high-risk, 40,460Â ha (5.02%) in medium risk, 431,908Â ha (53.55%) in low risk areas, and 281,127Â ha (34.86%) in very low risk.

Environmental protection and water management can be achieved by modeling flood susceptibility, to inform strategy that will reduce flood damage. The aim of this study is to develop novel hybrid models based on a radial basis functions neural network (RBFNN), arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA), artificial bee colony (ABC), and ant lion optimizer (ALO), to build flood susceptibility maps in the Quang Tri province of Vietnam. The obtained models were trained and validated using 1511 flood points and 14 conditioning factors. Various statistical indices were used to assess the performance of the models, namely root mean square error, receiver operation characteristics (ROC), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the coefficient of determination (R2). The comparison analysis highlights that the RBFNN-ABC model was better than other models with an AUC of 0.98, followed by RBFNN-AOA, support vector machine, and random forest, all with an AUC value of 0.96, and finally RBFNN-ALO, with an AUC of 0.95. From the flood susceptibility map, it can be seen that the eastern areas of the study area have high and very high flood susceptibility, that requires local government attention.

The Uttarakhand state of India was selected as a study area. A flash flood and geospatial database were developed in this regard. In the historical database, a total of 122 flash flood points were identified. A geospatial dataset was created with aspect, plan curvature, elevation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), annual rainfall, distance from river, distance from road, land use/cover (LULC), and sediment transport index (STI) in GIS. Weights were assigned to each influencing factor based on correlation using WOE in R open-source software, then ensembled with ANN, SVM, and KNN. Finally, all models were validated with different statistical indices, and subsequently, their performances were compared. All of the built models performed well, according to the results.

However, assessing floodÂ risk zones is difficult because of complex physical processes. In this study, a two-step flood hazard zoning model based on the random forest (RF) and self-organizing map (SOM) is proposed to yield the flood hazard zones map. In the first step (flood susceptibility analysis), the flood conditioning factors are used to obtain the flood susceptibility values. In the second step (flood hazard zoning), the proposed model not only considers the flood susceptibility value of the self-pixel as the module input, but also simultaneously considers flood susceptibility values of surrounding pixels to yield the flood hazard zoning map. The proposed model was applied to the Lanyang Plain in Yilan County, Taiwan, to demonstrate its advantages. The results indicated that the proposed model with the flood susceptibility values of the self-pixel and surrounding pixels does improve the assessment performance, significantly improving percentage of the effective ratio (ER) from results for the very high and high-risk level zones is 6 and 46%, respectively. The ER of the proposed model also improved by 9.6 and 30% for the very high and high-risk level zones than the conventional model, and it could provide optimal flood hazard zoning maps.

The primary objectives of the current work are to employ five well-known machine-learning algorithms, including the boosted regression tree (BRT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), generalized additive model (GAM), and generalized linear models (GLM), as intelligent methods and compare their proficiency in mapping the occurrence of flood hazards in the Saliantapeh basin, Golestan province, Iran, with an area of 4515.47 km2. Initially, 71 flood points are depicted to create a flood database map. Three data sets (i.e., ds1, ds2, and ds3) with a sample size of 30:70 are prepared using the random partitioning technique for evaluating the structure and accuracy of the models. Moreover, to model the flood potential, 16 conditioning factors related to floods (FCFs) are chosen as predictors. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) specifies the predictive model's ability to properly forecast flood event occurrence or nonflood occurrence. The applied models are executed properly both in predictive skill (area under the curve [AUC] value greater than 0.90) and in the degree of fitting (DOF), which results in valid predictions. In other words, the RF model displays better performance compared to other models for flood hazard prediction. It not only displays the best proficiency basis on the AUC approach but also provides the results of robust predictions once the data sets are varied. Moreover, by varying the learning and validation flood points, the performance of the RF method for modelling the flood occurrence is entirely stable. Therefore, this model should be investigated as an appropriate technique in other flood studies because it is able to generate robust and accurate flood potential maps for researchers, local governments, and planners in flood reduction strategies.

However, flood risk can be mitigated through event planning and city-wide preparation to reduce damage.

To predict flood susceptibility nine environmental related factors have been identified. They are elevation, slope, curvature, topographical wetness index (TWI), Euclidean distance from a river, land-cover, stream power index (SPI), soil type and precipitation. This work will use these environmental related factors alongside Sentinel-1 satellite imagery in a model intercomparison study to back-predict flood susceptibility in Jakarta for the January 2020 historic flood event across 260 key locations. For each location, this study uses current environmental conditions to predict flood status in the following month.

They include random forest, x-gradient boost, k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural network. Thirteen predisposing factors including aspect, curvature, digital elevation model (DEM), distance to rivers, drainage density, flow accumulation, flow direction, geology, land use, rainfall, slope, soil type, and topographic wetness index (TWI) were selected as inputs to achieve this. Four different models were developed for each ML algorithm based on variable selection and one-hot encoding. Overall, all the models of the four algorithms have an AUC score above 80% for the testing data, which means that they all performed very well.

The results demonstrate that these three deep learning models exhibit the capability to sensitively capture the dynamic changes in the process of floods evolution and simulate the depth of floodwater efficiently and accurately. Importantly, the deep learning models only take 14â24 s to generate the inundation depth map of the entire research domain, representing a significant improvement in prediction speed, exceeding that of traditional hydrodynamic models by >20 times. Due to the high computational efficiency, superior performance and simple modeling process, the deep learning models are expected to become a powerful tool for near real time flood early warning.

Recent geospatial practices advocated a multi-hazard analysis approach supported by artificial intelligence. This study proposes the Multi-Geoenvironmental Hazards Susceptibility (MGHS) tool, by combining Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with Machine Learning (ML) over the North-Moungo perimeter (Littoral Region, Cameroon). Methods: Twenty-four factors were constructed from satellite imagery, global geodatabase and fieldwork data. Multicollinearity among these factors was quantified using the tolerance coefficient (TOL) and variance inflation factor (VIF). The AHP coefficients were used to weigh the factors and produce a preliminary map per Geoenvironmental hazard through weighted linear combination (WLC). The sampling was conducted based on events records and analyst knowledge to proceed with classification using Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing interface. Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), were used as basic learners of the stacked hazard factors, whereas, Support Vector Regression (SVR), was used for a meta-learning. Results: The rainfall was ranked as the highest triggering factor for all Geoenvironmental hazards according to AHP, with a coefficient of 1, while the after-learning importance assessment was more varied. The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC/AUC) was always more than 0.96, and F1-score is between [0.86â0.88] for basic classifiers. Landslides, gully erosion and flash floods showed different spatial distributions, confirming then their probability of co-occurrence. MGHS outputs clearly displayed two and three simultaneous occurrences. Finally, the human vulnerability assessed with population layer and SVR outputs showed that high human concentrations are also the most exposed, using the example of Nkongsambaâs extract. Conclusions: Combining AHP with single learners, then a meta-learner, was efficient in modelling MGHS and related human vulnerability. Interactions among geo-environmental hazards are the next step and city councils are recommended to integrate results in the planning process.

For the random forest model, these values were 0.98 and 0.98, and for AdaBoost, they were 0.99 and 0.99. The multi-hazard maps were built by combining the landslide and flood susceptibility maps. The results showed that approximately 60% of the study area was affected by landslides, 30% by flood, and 8% by both hazards. These results illustrate how North Central is one of the regions of Vietnam that is most severely affected by natural hazards, particularly flooding, and landslides. The proposed models adapt to evaluate multi-hazard susceptibility at different scales, although expert intervention is also required, to optimize the algorithms. Multi-hazard maps can provide a valuable point of reference for decision makers in sustainable land-use planning and infrastructure development in regions faced with multiple hazards, and to prevent and reduce more effectively the frequency of floods and landslides and their damage to human life and property.

However, historical FID are insufficient in many regions. Remote sensing provides a promising opportunity to expand the FID. However, whether the FID expanded by remote sensing can improve the accuracy of flood susceptibility modeling needs further study. In this study, a framework was proposed for improving the accuracy of flood susceptibility prediction (FSP) by combining machine learning models and the expanded FID using Sentinel-1A radar images. Five widely used machine learning models were employed to verify the accuracy of the proposed method by taking Wuhan City as a case study, including the random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Sentinel-1A images from time points before, during, and after flood events were used to expand the FID for training the machine learning models. The results showed that the performance of the machine learning models for predicting flood susceptibility was improved greatly by considering the expanded FID, being improved by approximately 1.14â19.74% based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Among the used machine learning models, taking into account all the statistical indicators, the ANN showed the best performance, while the SVM showed the best generalization performance in Wuhan City. According to the results of the ANN model, approximately 19% of the area in Wuhan City, mainly distributed near rivers and lakes, is at a high flood susceptibility level.

The quality of the flood susceptibility model relies on the learning technique and the data used for learning. The performance of learning techniques has been extensively examined. However, to date, the impact of data sampling strategies has received limited attention. Random sampling is widely favored because of its ease of use. It treats flood-related data as tabular and excludes their spatial dimensions. Flood occurrence is typically uneven over space. Therefore, non-flood sampling should not be completely random. To represent the impact of the spatial dimension, this study proposed a new sampling approach based on spatial dependence, called inverse-occurrence sampling. It selects more non-flood data in low-risk areas than in high-risk areas. The new sampling approach was compared with random and stratified sampling, using six machine learning techniques in two urban areas in Guangzhou, China, with distinct flood mechanisms, that is, Tianhe (flood density 1.5/km2, clustered distribution, average slope 9.02Â°, downtown district) and Panyu (flood density 0.15/km2, random distribution, average slope 4.55Â°, suburban district). Learning techniques include support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), CNN-SVM, and CNN-RF. The main findings of this study were as follows: (1) Sampling approaches had a greater impact on model performance than learning techniques in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC variations caused by learning techniques ranged from 0.04 to 0.09. Meanwhile, the AUC variations caused by sampling approaches were between 0.15 and 0.22, all larger than 0.1. (2) The new sampling approach outperformed that of the other two sampling approaches for high average AUC values and small AUC variations. The outperformance is robust in regard to multiple learning techniques and different flooding mechanisms. AUCs in the inverse group had a narrower range (0.14â0.18 in Tianhe and 0.35â0.39 in Panyu) than in the random group (0.24â0.28 in Tianhe and 0.43â0.53 in Panyu) and the stratified group (0.23â0.30 in Tianhe and 0.42â0.48 in Panyu). (3) The most accurate learning technique for AUC was CNN-RF, followed by SVM, CNN-SVM, RF, CNN, and ANN. (4) ANN- and CNN-based models tended to produce polarized patterns in flood susceptibility maps, contradicting the ascending order of flood density with increasing susceptibility levels. Flood density outliers tended to appear in the models derived using RF and CNN-RF. Finally, the newly proposed sampling approach is suggested to be applied to flood susceptibility mapping to reflect the impact of spatial dependence.

In this study, we employ advanced remote sensing and machine learning methodologies to investigate the effects of flooding on biodiversity, from individual species to broader ecological communities. Specifically, we utilized Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and an ensemble of machine-learning algorithms to derive a flood susceptibility indicator. Our primary objective is to investigate the potential benefits of incorporating flood susceptibility, as a proxy for flood risk, into species distribution models (SDMs). By doing so, we aim to improve the performance of SDMs and gain deeper insights into the consequences of floods to biodiversity. Within the biodiverse landscape of the Zagros Mountains, a crucial Irano-Anatolian biodiversity hotspots, we examined the sensitivity of mammals, amphibians, and reptilesâ distributions to flooding. Our analysis compared the performance of models that combined flood susceptibility with climate variables against models relying solely on climate variables. The results indicate that the inclusion of flood susceptibility significantly improves the capacity of models to explain and map species distributions for 67% of the species in our study region. Notably, amphibians and mammals are more profoundly affected by flooding compared to reptiles. The study highlights the importance of incorporating flood susceptibility as a predictor variable in species distribution models to improve the baseline characterization of potential species distributions. The importance of this variable will obviously depend on the regional context and the species studied but its relevance is likely to increase with climate change. In summary, our research demonstrates the integration of remote sensing and machine learning as a potent approach to advance biodiversity data science, monitoring, and conservation in the face of climate-induced flooding.

Model performance was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve, which showed an area under the curve of 0.925 and an overall accuracy score of 80%. The important flood-influencing factors (FIFs) were investigated using both feature importance scores and the SHapely Additive exPlanations method (SHAP), creating a flood hazard map of the region and a map of SHAP contributions. It was found that the elevation, slope, and normalised difference vegetation index were the most important FIFs overall. However, in some regions, the distance to the river and the stream power index dominated for a similar flood hazard susceptibility outcome. Validation using SHAP to test the physical reasoning of the model confirmed the reliability of the flood hazard map. This study shows that explainable artificial intelligence allows for improved interpretation of model predictions, assisting decision-makers in better understanding machine learning-based flood hazard assessments and ultimately aiding in mitigating adverse impacts of flooding in coastal regions affected by TCs.

So far, few studies into inundation susceptibility have explicitly incorporated the effects of climate change into their methodologies. This study aimed to assess inundation susceptibility for Vinh Phuc province in Vietnam, from 2000 to 2020, using machine learning and remote sensing. The algorithms used were support vector machine, catboost, and extratrees. A geo-spatial database of 206 inundation points and 11 conditioning factors (namely elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, distance to river, distance to road, NDVI, NDBI, rainfall, soil type, and TWI) from 2000 to 2020 was developed to be used as the input data. RMSE, MAE, AUC, and RÂ² were used to assess the fit of the models. The results showed that all the proposed models were a good fit, with AUC values of 0.95 and over. In general, the total area marked as very low risk or low risk has increased, with the high risk and very high-risk areas having decreased over the period studied. This change was mainly concentrated in the city of Vinh Yen where there has been strong urban growth. The models proposed in this study are a promising toolkit to assess inundation susceptibility continuously and can support decision makers involved in sustainable development. Our results highlight the benefits and consequences of planned and unplanned development. Properly planned can reduce the flood risk, while unplanned development can increase the risk. Therefore, by applying the theoretical framework in this study, decision makers or planners can build the most appropriate strategies for flood control in the context of climate change. Our approach in this study represents a theoretical framework for future research not only on inundation management but also natural hazard management, in regions around the world.

This study develops and tests a deep learning approach for large-scale spatial flood modeling, using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and optimized versions combined with the Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) or the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA). With Sweden as an application case for nation-wide flood susceptibility mapping, this modeling approach considers ten geo-environmental input factors (slope, elevation, aspect, plan curvature, length of slope, topographic wetness index, distance from river, distance from wetland, rainfall, and land use). The GWO and ICA optimization improves model prediction by 12% and 8%, respectively, compared with the standalone CNN model performance. The results show 40% of the land area, 45% of the railroad, and 43% of the road network of Sweden to have high or very high flood susceptibility. They also show the aspect to have the highest input factor impact on flood susceptibility prediction while, for example, rainfall ranks only seven of the total 10 considered geo-environmental input factors. In general, accurate nation-wide flood susceptibility prediction is essential for guiding flood management and mitigation efforts. This study's approach to such prediction has emerged as well-performing and cost-effective for the case of Sweden, calling for further application and testing in other world regions.

The majority of studies, however, have concentrated on creating models for particular water sources, drainage systems, and gauge stations area. Therefore, unless further data is supplied and the models are subsequently trained, their outcomes cannot be effectively applied to different scenarios. With its excellent spatio-temporal accuracy range with the advanced analytics, the forthcoming Global Navigations Satellite Systems (GNSSs) technology offers a novel method for the monitoring of flood disasters in dynamic manner. This study recommends a Multi-layered Neural Network (MNN) for flood monitoring, which combines a Convolutional Neural Networking (CNN) along with a backward propagation based (BP) learning network. The CNN component is used to obtain the abstracted features from full delay doppler maping images. The BP section is provided with GNSSs characteristics, such as reflection of surface with power range, and also the vegetation attributes from the Soil Moistening Active Passives (SMAP) satellite source data. In comparison to physiologically based models, the results shown that the CNN-oriented system makes accurate predictions on ""unseen"" areas of catchment with a substantially shorter processing time. The obtained results imply that, with respect to accuracy of prediction, the patch-enabled option is superior to the resizing-based option. Additionally, every experiment has demonstrated that the forecast of flow speed is more precise than the prognosis of water depth, indicating that the water deposition is more complex to information about global level elevations than the flow speed with velocity.

Initially, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1) and optical (Landsat-8) satellite images were integrated to monitor the flooded areas during the July 2022 monsoon in the study area. A dataset of 509 flood occurrence points was created to identify flood-prone areas using remote sensing techniques, considering the monitored flood areas. The dataset also included twelve flood-related criteria: topography, land cover, and climate. The holdout method was employed for modeling, with a ratio of 70:30 used for the train/test split. Data pre-processing techniques were conducted to improve model performance, including determining criteria importance and addressing multicollinearity issues using certainty factor (CF), multicollinearity, and information gain ratio (IGR) methods. Then FSM was prepared using RF, RF-IWO, RF-SBO, and RF-SMA models. The findings of this research revealed that the RF-IWO model was the best predictive model of flood susceptibility modeling, with root-mean-square-error (RMSE) (0.211 and 0.0.27), mean-absolute-error (MAE) (0.103 and 0.15), and coefficient-of-determination (R2) (0.821 and 0.707) in the training and testing phases, respectively.

This research aims to construct a more comprehensive flood assessment framework by emphasizing factors related to human resilience and integrating them with meteorological and geographical factors. Moreover, two ensemble learning models, namely voting and stacking, which utilize heterogeneous learners, were employed in this study, and their prediction performance was compared with that of traditional machine learning models, including support vector machine, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and gradient boosting decision tree. The six models were trained and tested using a sample database constructed from historical flood events in Hefei, China. The results demonstrated the following findings: (1) the RF model exhibited the highest accuracy, while the SVR model underestimated the extent of extremely high-risk areas. The stacking model underestimated the extent of very-high-risk areas. It should be noted that the prediction results of ensemble learning methods may not be superior to those of the base models upon which they are built. (2) The predicted high-risk and very-high-risk areas within the study area are predominantly clustered in low-lying regions along the rivers, aligning with the distribution of hazardous areas observed in historical inundation events. (3) It is worth noting that the factor of distance to pumping stations has the second most significant driving influence after the DEM (Digital Elevation Model). This underscores the importance of considering human resilience factors. This study expands the empirical evidence for the ability of machine learning methods to be employed in flood risk assessment and deepens our understanding of the potential mechanisms of human resilience in influencing urban flood risk.

Our objective was to identify flood-prone areas along the meandering Kashkan River and investigate the role of topography in riverbank inundation. To validate the flood susceptibility map generated by the random forest algorithm, we employed Sentinel-1 GRDH SAR imagery from the March 2019 flooding event in the Kashkan river. The SNAP software and the OTSU thresholding method were utilized to extract the flooded/inundated areas from the SAR imagery. The results showed that the random forest model accurately pinpointed areas with a âvery highâ and âhighâ risk of flooding. Through analysis of the cross-sections and SAR-based flood maps, we discovered that the topographical confinement of the meander played a crucial role in the extent of inundation along the meandering path.

Existing road inundation studies either lack empirical data for model validations or focus mainly on road inundation exposure assessment based on flood maps. This study addresses this limitation by using crowdsourced and fine-grained traffic data as an indicator of road inundation, and topographic, hydrologic, and temporal precipitation features as predictor variables. Two tree-based machine learning models (random forest and AdaBoost) were then tested and trained for predicting road inundations in the contexts of 2017 Hurricane Harvey and 2019 Tropical Storm Imelda in Harris County, Texas. The findings from Hurricane Harvey indicate that precipitation is the most important feature for predicting road inundation susceptibility, and that topographic features are more critical than hydrologic features for predicting road inundations in both storm cases. The random forest and AdaBoost models had relatively high AUC scores (0.860 and 0.810 for Harvey respectively and 0.790 and 0.720 for Imelda respectively) with the random forest model performing better in both cases. The random forest model showed stable performance for Harvey, while varying significantly for Imelda. This study advances the emerging field of smart flood resilience in terms of predictive flood risk mapping at the road level. In particular, such models could help impacted communities and emergency management agencies develop better preparedness and response strategies with improved situational awareness of road inundation likelihood as an extreme weather event unfolds.

Due to complexity and ferocity of severe flooding, predicting flood-prone areas is a difficult task. Thus, creating flood susceptibility maps at local level is though challenging but an inevitable task. In order to implement a flood management plan for the Balrampur district, an agricultural dominant landscape of India, and strengthen its resilience, flood susceptibility modeling and mapping are carried out. In the present study, three hybrid machine learning (ML) models, namely, fuzzy-ANN (artificial neural network), fuzzy-RBF (radial basis function), and fuzzy-SVM (support vector machine) with 12 topographic, hydrological, and other flood influencing factors were used to determine flood-susceptible zones. To ascertain the relationship between the occurrences and flood influencing factors, correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) and multicollinearity diagnostic tests were used. The predictive power of these models was validated and compared using a variety of statistical techniques, including Wilcoxon signed-rank, t-paired tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results show that fuzzy-RBF model outperformed other hybrid ML models for modeling flood susceptibility, followed by fuzzy-ANN and fuzzy-SVM. Overall, these models have shown promise in identifying flood-prone areas in the basin and other basins around the world. The outcomes of the work would benefit policymakers and government bodies to capture the flood-affected areas for necessary planning, action, and implementation.

This research investigates the hazards of landslides and floods in two adopted basins in the Yamaguchi and Shimane prefectures, Japan. This study utilized ten environmental variables alongside categories representing landslide-prone, non-landslide, flooded, and non-flooded areas. Employing a machine-learning approach, namely, a LASSO regression model, we generated Landslide Hazard Maps (LHM), Flood Hazard Maps (FHM), and a Composite Hazard Map (CHM). The LHM identified flood-prone low-lying areas in the northwest and southeast, while central and northwest regions exhibited higher landslide susceptibility. Both LHM and FHM were classified into five hazard levels. Landslide hazards predominantly covered high- to moderate-risk areas, since the high-risk areas constituted 38.8% of the study region. Conversely, flood hazards were mostly low to moderate, with high- and very high-risk areas at 10.49% of the entire study area. The integration of LHM and FHM into CHM emphasized high-risk regions, underscoring the importance of tailored mitigation strategies. The accuracy of the model was assessed by employing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve method, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were determined. The LHM and FHM exhibited an exceptional AUC of 99.36% and 99.06%, respectively, signifying the robust efficacy of the model. The novelty in this study is the generation of an integrated representation of both landslide and flood hazards. Finally, the produced hazard maps are essential for policymaking to address vulnerabilities to landslides and floods.

Cities like Nagpur, which are newly prone to disasters, need to identify flood-prone areas for planning city development and mitigation measures. Developing countries lack data to generate susceptibility maps, thus remote sensing (RS) and GIS have been used in this study. Ten flood-causing parameters namely altitude, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI), landuse/landcover (LULC), soil texture, rainfall, surface runoff, distance from river, lithology and landforms, have been mapped for Nagpur on ArcGIS10.8 using freely available data. The frequency ratio (FR) model has been adopted, with 70% of flood locations used for machine learning and the remaining 30% for validation. Parameters of surface runoff (FR up to 4.30), landform (FR up to 3.58), lithology (FR up to 2.36), and high rainfall (FR up to 1.82) have shown a maximum positive relationship with the flood-prone areas.

The park, located in the estuaries of the Brahmani, Baitarani, Dharma, and Mahanadi river systems, is home to Indiaâs second-largest mangrove environment and the worldâs most active and diverse saline wetland. To evaluate its vulnerability and risk, various threats were considered, with a focus on floods. Satellite imageries, such as Landsat 8 OLI, SRTM digital elevation model, open street map, Google pro image, reference map, field survey, and other ancillary data, were utilized to develop vulnerability and risk indicators. These indicators were then reclassified into âCostâ and âBenefitâ categories for better understanding. The factors were standardized using the max-min standardization method before being fed into the vulnerability and risk model. Initially, an analytical hierarchy approach was used to develop the model, which was later compared with machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM) and uncertainty analysis indices (e.g., overall accuracy, kappa, map quality, etc.). The results showed that the SVM-RBF machine learning algorithm outperformed the traditional geostatistical model (AHP), with an overall accuracy of 99.54% for flood risk mapping compared to AHPâs 91.12%. The final output reveals that a large area of Bhitarkanika National park falls under high flood risk zone.

The data (comprised of the nine flood-conditioning variables) for the larger portion (70% of cases) were used to build the models and the remaining 30% of cases were used to test them. The performances of the models were evaluated with several statistical and error tests (TP, TN, FP, FN, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results show that the hybrid (ensemble) methods boosted accuracy performance above the standalone REPT by between 2.56 and 15.38%.

GAT uses nodes and edges to represent spatial units and their relative spatial relationships. Based on its graph structure and attention mechanism, GAT automatically extracts high-order features from inputs of labeled and unlabeled units for modeling. In the metropolitan area of Dalian, China, GAT outperformed other models in flooded-nonflooded sample classification and exhibited a rational flood susceptibility distribution pattern, with only four basic flood conditioning factors and less than 1.2% of units for training.

Recently, machine learning methods have been widely used in flood susceptibility analysis. This paper proposes a NHAND (New Height Above the Nearest Drainage) model as a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of both individual learners and ensemble models in addressing intricate flood-related challenges. The evaluation process encompasses critical dimensions such as prediction accuracy, model training duration, and stability. Research findings reveal that, compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Lasso, Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Stacked Generalization (Stacking) outperforms in terms of predictive accuracy and stability. Meanwhile, XGBoost exhibits notable efficiency in terms of training duration. Additionally, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method is employed to explain the predictions made by the XGBoost.",SUSTAINABILITY,10.3390/su152014928,0,0,Yes,Peoples R China,"SVM,KNN,LASSO,RF,XGB,STACK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, accurate modeling and prediction of floods are challenging due to their complexity. The current research has proposed a novel approach for Flood Hazard (FH) prediction using hybrid Machine Learning (ML) models that integrate ensemble ML models with several Feature Selection (FS) algorithms. An optimum set of Flood Influential Factors (FIFs) was determined using the Simulated Annealing (SA) and Information Gain (IG) FS algorithms. The ensemble ML models employed include AdaboostM1 (ABM), Boosted Generalized Linear Model (BGLM), and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) algorithms. In addition, the hyper-parameters of the hybrid models were optimized using the random search (RS) method and repeated crossvalidation technique. The proposed hybrid models were trained using flood inventory map and FIFs obtained from a spatial database. The results verified that the SA and IG algorithms detect 9 and 13 factors as FIFs in the FH assessment, respectively. Moreover, rainfall, distance to river, altitude, and lithology FIFs have a greater impact than the other factors in the Sardabroud watershed, Mazandaran Province, Iran. Several robust indicators, such as the area under curve (AUC) in relative operating characteristic (ROC) curves and statistical measurements, were employed to assess the robustness of hybrid models. SA-ABM model had the highest AUC value (0.983), while IG-ABM, SA-BGLM, SA-SGB, IG-BGLM, and IG-SGB had lower values (0.952 to 0.973). Finally, the SA-ABM hybrid model classified 27% of the study area as having a high hazard of floods.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,10.1016/j.jag.2023.103443,0,0,Yes,"Iran,Peoples R China,India","AB,BOGLM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For better natural hazards risk perception and preparedness, it is important to study the nature-hazards risk distribution in different areas, specifically a major priority in the areas of high hazards level and social vulnerability. We propose a multi-hazards risk assessment method which considers social vulnerability into the analyzing and utilize machine learning-enabled models to solve this issue. The proposed methodology integrates three aspects as follows: (1) characterization and mapping of multi-hazards (Flooding, Wildfires, and Seismic) using five machine learning methods including Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and K-Means (KM); (2) evaluation of social vulnerability with a composite index tailored for the case-study area and using machine learning models for classification; (3) risk-based quantification of spatial interaction mechanisms between multi-hazards and social vulnerability. The results indicate that RF model performs best in both hazard-related and social vulnerability datasets. The most cities at multi-hazards risk account for 34.12% of total studied cities (covering 20.80% land). Additionally, high multi-hazards level and socially vulnerable cities account for 15.88% (covering 4.92% land). This study generates a multi-hazards risk map which show a wide variety of spatial patterns and a corresponding understanding of where regional high hazards potential and vulnerable areas are. It emphasizes an urgent need to implement information-based prioritization when natural hazards coming, and effective policy measures for reducing natural-hazards risks in future.",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/s41598-023-40159-9,0,0,Yes,United States,"NB,KNN,LR,RF",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flood is one of these tensions, and to reduce the damages caused by it, it is necessary to identify vulnerable areas. This study aims is to evaluate the resilience of flood-prone sub-watersheds in the Beshar basin the Kohgiluyeh-Boyerahmad province of Iran. For this purpose, flood risk areas were determined using three machine learning models (MLMs), including random forest (RF), generalized linear model (GLM), and artificial neural network (ANN). Three models were evalu-ated based on criteria such as the ROC curve and Kappa coefficient, and the most accurate model was selected to identify areas at risk and complete the resilience questionnaire by residents. So-cial, economic, policy, and infrastructure criteria and 24 important and influential items were used to measure resilience. Different statistical methods were used to analyze the questionnaires and determine the resilience of different sub-basins. The results showed that the RF model (AUC = 0.96) is more accurate than the other two models. The flood risk map also showed that the very low-risk class had the largest area (2722 km2, 86% of the total study area). Also, the re-silience results showed a decrease in the mean resilience scores after 2006 compared to before 2006. The results of the spatial changes of the resilience of different sub-watersheds in these two periods showed that in the first period, 4, 9, 13, and 16 sub-watersheds are in the low resilience class and, 10 and 17 sub-watersheds are in the high resilience class. Also; after 2006, 3, 4, 9, and 21 sub-watersheds were placed in the low resilience class and 10, 13, and 14 sub-watersheds were in the high resilience class, which has had changes compared to the previous period.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.103910,0,0,Yes,Iran,"RF,GLM,ANN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
