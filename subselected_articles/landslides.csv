The efficiency of the DLNN model was estimated for the Kon Tum Province, Viet Nam, an area characterized by the presence of landslide phenomena. Nine landslide related variables, elevation, slope angle, aspect, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, soil type, distance to faults, distance to geology boundaries, lithology cover, and 1,657 landslide locations, were used so as to produce the training and validation datasets during the landslide susceptibility assessment. The Frequency Ratio method was used so as to estimate the existing relation between the landslide-related variables and the presence of landslides, assigning to each variable class a weight value. Based on the results concerning the predictive ability of the landslide related variables which was evaluated using the Information ration method, all variables were further processed since they appear as highly predictive. The learning ability of the DLNN model has been evaluated and compared with a Multi Layer Preceptron Neural Network, a Support Vector Machine, a C4.5-Decision Tree model and a Random Forest model using the training dataset, whereas the predictive performance of each model has been evaluated and compared using the validation datasets. In order to evaluate their learning and predictive capacity of each model the classification accuracy, the sensitivity, the specificity and the area under the success and predictive rate curves (AUC) were calculated. Results showed that the proposed DLNN model had a higher performance than the four benchmark models. Although DLNN has been used seldom in landslide susceptibility assessments, the study highlights that the usage of deep learning approach could be considered as a satisfactory alternative approach for landslide susceptibility mapping.

This study describes the development and validation of a spatially explicit deep learning (DL) neural network model for the prediction of landslide susceptibility. A geospatial database was generated based on 217 landslide events from the Muong Lay district (Vietnam), for which a suite of nine landslide conditioning factors was derived. The Relief-F feature selection method was employed to quantify the utility of the conditioning factors for developing the landslide predictive model. Several performance metrics demonstrated that the DL model performed well both in terms of the goodness-of-fit with the training dataset (AUC = 0.90; accuracy = 82%; RMSE = 0.36) and the ability to predict future landslides (AUC = 0.89; accuracy = 82%; RMSE = 0.38). The efficiency of the model was compared to the quadratic discriminant analysis, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, and multi-layer perceptron neural network. A comparative analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed a significant improvement of landslide prediction using the spatially explicit DL model over these other models.

These landslides can be deadly to the community living downslope with their fast pace, turning failures into catastrophic debris flows and avalanches. Active tectonics coupled with rugged topography in a complex geoenvironment multiplies this likelihood. The available hazard maps are usually helpful in mitigating disasters. However, fool-proof predicting landslide susceptibility identification remains a challenge in landslide discipline. Recently, ensemble machine learning (ML) techniques have proved the potential to provide a more accurate and efficient solution in spatial modeling. The main purposes of the current study are to examine and evaluate the predictive capability of support vector machine hybrid ensemble ML algorithms, i.e., the bagging, boosting, and stacking for modeling the catastrophic rainfall-induced landslide occurrences in the Northern parts of Kyushu Island, at the watershed scale in Japan. In this study, a landslide inventory map containing 265 landslide polygons was first interpreted from the aerial photographs and fieldwork after the September 2017 rainfall event. The raw data were randomly separated into two parts using a 70/30 sampling strategy for training and validating the landslide models. Then, 13 predisposing factors were prepared as predictors and dependent variable. The landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) were validated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results of validation showed that the AUC values of the four models (SVM-Stacking, SVM, SVM-Bagging, and SVM-Boosting)Â varied from 0.74 to 0.91. The SVM-boosting model outperformed the other models, while SVM-stacking model has found to be the lowest performance. The outcome suggests that an ensemble ML model does not necessarily mean good performance. It is always preferable to select an appropriate model, such as the one proposed the hybrid novel ensemble SVM-boosting model, which could significantly improve the accuracies of LSM. Also, from Information Gain Ratio (IGR)Â we found that the rainfall factor mainly affects the results, that agrees with the analogy of present study.

A total of 219 slide inventories and 17 slide conditioning variables were obtained for modelling. The data showed a complex scenario. Some past slides have spread over steep lands, while others have spread through flat terrain. Random forest (RF) served to keep only important factors for further analysis as a pre-processing measure. To select CNN hyperparameters, Bayesian optimization was used. Three methods contributed to overcoming the overfitting issue owing to small training data in our research. The selection of key factors by RF helped first of all to reduce information dimensionality. Second, the CNN model with 1D convolutions was intended to considerably decrease the number of its parameters. Third, a high rate of drop-out (0.66) helped reduce the CNN parameters. Overall accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) and 5-fold cross-validation were used to evaluate the models. CNN performance was compared to ANN and SVM. CNN achieved the highest accuracy on testing dataset (83.11%) and AUROC (0.880, 0.893, using testing and 5-fold CV, respectively). Bayesian optimization enhanced CNN accuracy by~3% (compared with default configuration). CNN could outperform ANN and SVM owing to its complicated architecture and handling of spatial correlations through convolution and pooling operations. In complex situations where some variables make a non-linear contribution to the occurrence of landslides, the method suggested could thus help develop landslide susceptibility maps.

Deep learning methods can exploit low-level features and high-level representations of information from environmental factors. In this paper, a novel deep learningâbased algorithm, the fully connected spare autoencoder (FC-SAE), is proposed for LSP. The FC-SAE consists of four steps: raw feature dropout in input layers, a sparse feature encoder in hidden layers, sparse feature extraction in output layers, and classification and prediction. The Sinan County of Guizhou Province in China, with a total of 23,195 landslide grid cells (306 recorded landslides) and 23,195 randomly selected non-landslide grid cells, was used as study case. The frequency ratio values of 27 environmental factors were taken as the input variables of FC-SAE. All 46,390 landslide and non-landslide grid cells were randomly divided into a training dataset (70%) and a test dataset (30%). By analyzing real landslide/non-landslide data, the performances of the FC-SAE and two other conventional machine learning methods, support vector machine (SVM) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN), were compared. The results show that the prediction rate and total accuracies of the FC-SAE are 0.854 and 85.2% which are higher than those of the SVM-only (0.827 and 81.56%) and BPNN (0.819 and 80.86%), respectively.

Meanwhile, the present study aims to build landslide susceptibility maps based on bivariate statistical correlation analysis, optimization of different kernel functions, comparison of three landslide susceptibility maps and systematic analysis of spatial patterns. The steps of this article are organized as follows: Firstly, a landslide inventory containing 263 historical landslide locations was constructed. For the purpose of training and validation of models, 263 landslide locations were randomly divided into two parts with a ratio of 70/30. Secondly, 14 landslide conditioning factors were extracted from the spatial database. Subsequently, correlation analysis between the conditioning factors and the occurrence of landslides was conducted using frequency ratios. Then, the conditioning factors with normalized frequency ratios values were used as inputs to build the landslide susceptibility maps using the three models. A multicollinearity analysis was performed using collinearity statistics. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for comparison and validation of models for recognizing the prediction capability. By further quantitative comparing mapped susceptibility values on a pixel-by-pixel basis, which can acquire underestimations and overestimations of factors (distance to river and slope) and susceptibility area. The results indicated that the PUKLR model had superior performance in landslide susceptibility assessment, with the highest AUC values of 0.884 and 0.766 for training and validation datasets, respectively. This model was followed by the RBFKLR model and the PLKLR model for the training datasets (AUC values of 0.879 and 0.797, respectively), and the PLKLR model and the RBFKLR model for the validation datasets (AUC values of 0.758 and 0.752, respectively).

The purpose of this study is to optimize the hyperparameters based on a Bayesian optimization algorithm, and to obtain a high accuracy random forest landslide susceptibility evaluation model. The research steps are detailed as follows. Firstly, taking a typical landslide prone mountainous area as an example, 16 conditioning factors, such as elevation, annual average rainfall, distance from roads, distance from buildings and so on, were preliminarily selected as the conditioning factors of landslide susceptibility. Combined with 1520 historical landslide events, a geospatial database was established with 30 m resolution. Secondly, the geospatial data sample set was constructed by random sampling according to ratio of historical landslides and non-landslides of 1:10. Based on the whole sample set, the random forest model adopted the Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters. Next, the optimal hyperparameters were selected to be trained to get the evaluation model of landslide susceptibility. In addition, they were carried out the analysis of landslide susceptibility mapping for the whole study area. After that, the recursive feature elimination method was used to screen out the dominant conditioning factors that can explain the degree of landslide susceptibility. The results indicated that the area under curve (AUC) values of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in training data set, verification data set and regional simulation were 0.95, 0.87 and 0.93, respectively. 65% of the historical landslides fell between the high susceptibility and very high susceptibility regions, which made up <20% of the research area. The model was in good agreement to the distribution characteristics of historical landslides in the study area. We noted that all the three recent landslides with impact on the study area occurred at the locations predicted by the model to have high or very high susceptibility in terms of typical landslides in the near future. As for conditioning factors, the contribution related to human activities accounted for a large proportion. In conclusion, an evaluation model with high precision for random forest landslide susceptibility can be built based on hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian optimization algorithm. Simultaneously, using recursive feature elimination method, a random forest landslide susceptibility model with fewer dominant conditioning factors and guaranteed evaluation accuracy can also be built to save the running time and input data resources of the model.

They are responsible for substantial damages and losses in those areas. The A1 Highway, which is an important road in Algeria, was sometimes constructed in mountainous and/or semi-mountainous areas. Previous studies of landslide susceptibility mapping conducted near this road using statistical and expert methods have yielded ordinary results. In this research, we are interested in how do machine learning techniques help in increasing accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps in the vicinity of the A1 Highway corridor. To do this, an important section at Ain Bouziane (NE, Algeria) is chosen as a case study to evaluate the landslide susceptibility using three different machine learning methods, namely, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and boosted regression tree (BRT). First, an inventory map and nine input factors were prepared for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) analyses. The three models were constructed to find the most susceptible areas to this phenomenon. The results were assessed by calculating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the standard error (Std. error), and the confidence interval (CI) at 95%. The RF model reached the highest predictive accuracy (AUC ?= ?97.2%) comparatively to the other models. The outcomes of this research proved that the obtained machine learning models had the ability to predict future landslide locations in this important road section. In addition, their application gives an improvement of the accuracy of LSMs near the road corridor. The machine learning models may become an important prediction tool that will identify landslide alleviation actions.

A hot research topic has been the ability to predict landslide susceptibility, which can be used to design schemes of land exploitation and urban development in mountainous areas. In this study, the teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) and satin bowerbird optimizer (SBO) algorithms were applied to optimize the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model for landslide susceptibility mapping. In the study area, 152 landslides were identified and randomly divided into two groups as training (70%) and validation (30%) dataset. Additionally, a total of fifteen landslide influencing factors were selected. The relative importance and weights of various influencing factors were determined using the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method. Finally, the comprehensive performance of the two models was validated and compared using various indexes, such as the root mean square error (RMSE), processing time, convergence, and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). The results demonstrated that the AUROC values of the ANFIS, ANFIS-TLBO and ANFIS-SBO models with the training data were 0.808, 0.785 and 0.755, respectively. In terms of the validation dataset, the ANFIS-SBO model exhibited a higher AUROC value of 0.781, while the AUROC value of the ANFIS-TLBO and ANFIS models were 0.749 and 0.681, respectively. Moreover, the ANFIS-SBO model showed lower RMSE values for the validation dataset, indicating that the SBO algorithm had a better optimization capability. Meanwhile, the processing time and convergence of the ANFIS-SBO model were far superior to those of the ANFIS-TLBO model. Therefore, both the ensemble models proposed in this paper can generate adequate results, and the ANFIS-SBO model is recommended as the more suitable model for landslide susceptibility assessment in the study area considered due to its excellent accuracy and efficiency.

This study plans to compare the prediction performance of these data-driven models on the landslide susceptibility mapping, thus further to explore the inherently features of these data-driven models. As a result, a more accurate and reliable LSP can be realized through choosing an optimal data-based model. A heuristic model represented by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a general statistical model represented by the general linear model (GLM) and information value (IV) model, and machine learning models represented by binary logistic regression (BLR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM) and C5.0 decision tree (C5.0 DT) are adopted in this study. Shicheng County in China is used as the study area. In total, 369 landslides identified through field investigation are classified as training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Next, 13 landslide conditioning factors (elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, relief amplitude, total surface radiation, population density, Normalized difference vegetation index, distance to river, topographic wetness index and rock types) are acquired from data sources of the free remote sensing images, Digital Elevation Model, field investigation and government reports. The correlations between these conditioning factors and the landslide locations are determined by frequency ratio analysis. Then, the landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs) calculated by the eight trained models are imported into GIS software to produce landslide susceptibility maps of Shicheng County.

However, new advancements in statistical and machine learning algorithms continuously being updated the landslide susceptibility paradigm. This paper explores the predictive performance power of different sampling techniques in landslide susceptibility mapping in the wake of increased usage of artificial intelligence. We used logistic regression (LR), neural network (NNET), and deep learning neural network (DNN) model for testing and validation of the models. The tests were applied to the 2018 Hokkaido Earthquake affected areas using a set of 11 predictor variables (seismic, topographic, and hydrological). We found that the prediction rates are inconsequential with the DNN model irrespective of the sampling technique (AUC: 0.904 â 0.919). Whereas, testing with LR (AUC: 0.825 â 0.785) and NNET (AUC: 0.882 â 0.858) produces larger differences in the accuracies between the four datasets. Nonetheless, the highest success rates were obtained for samples within the landslide scarp area. The analogy was then validated with a published landslide inventory from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. We, therefore, suggest that DNN models as an appropriate technique to increase the predictive performance of landslide susceptibilities if the landslide scarp and body are not characterized properly in an inventory.

First, data for 1520 historical landslides occurring was collected from field investigations and literature reviews, to construct a spatial database of 16 conditioning factors. Subsequently, the Bayesian algorithm was adopted to optimize the hyperparameters of the LR and RF models, premised on the dataset of all cells (including landslides and non-landslides). Finally, the two optimized models were estimated and compared with the area under curve (AUC) and confusion matrix. Based on the Bayesian algorithm, the AUC value of the test dataset in LR model is improved by 4%, while the AUC value of the test dataset in RF model is improved by 10%, indicating that both models' hyperparameter optimization premised on the Bayesian algorithm have delivered considerable impact on the accuracy of the models; so hyperparameter optimization is very important for models of LSM. Although both models exhibit reasonable performances, the optimized RF model premised on hyperparameter optimization has a better stability and predictive capability in case area. These findings make up for the crucial step in LSM (hyperparameter optimization) through the Bayesian algorithm, and provide a comparison case between LR and RF models after comprehensive consideration of hyperparameter optimization, so as to increase the convincing power of the comparison of these models and provide a knowledge base for model comparison: comparison premised on hyperparameter optimization.

Mapping of landslide susceptibility is an important tool to prevent and control landslide disasters. The purpose of this study is to make use of a hybrid machine learning approach by combining the reduced-error pruning trees (Rept) with a series of ensemble techniques (Bagging, Dagging, and Real Adaboost) and compare the performance of each combination for landslide susceptibility modeling. The combination of Rept model and Real Adaboost (RRept)is a novel application in the field of landslide susceptibility. Firstly, a landslide inventory map was prepared with 298 determined historical landslides events in the study area, 209 landslides (70%) were randomly selected for the training dataset and the remaining 89 landslides (30%) were used for validation dataset. On this basis, 16 landslide influencing factors were included in the landslide susceptibility evaluation (slope angle, elevation, slope aspect, sediment transport index (STI), topographical wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), profile curvature, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to faults, soil, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landuse, lithology and rainfall). Secondly, the correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) method was used to select the most important factors for the proposed landslide susceptibility model. The results show that all the factors contribute to the occurrence of landslide. Slope angle, Landuse, Elevation, Distance to roads, Soil and Lithology have the greatest influence on the occurrence of landslide. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC), standard error (SE), 95% confidence interval and mean absolute error (MAE) were then used to validate and compare the performance of the model. The best model should have the largest AUC value, the smallest SE, the narrowest 95% CI and the smallest MAE. The results show that the three hybrid models perform better than the Rept model alone. For the training data set, the RRept model has highest AUC value (0.927), the smallest SE (0.121), the narrowest 95% confidence interval (0.898â0.95) and the lowest MAE (0.20). For the validation data set, the RRept model has the highest AUC value (0.745), the narrowest 95% confidence interval (0.674â0.807) and the lowest MAE (0.33). The RRept has the highest predictive power for landslide susceptibility evaluation. The results show that a hybrid method improves the prediction ability of the base Rept model. In addition, the RRept model is a promising comprehensive model that can be applied to landslide susceptibility mapping.

At first, we construct maps depicting the most effective factors on floods (12 factors), forest fires (10 factors), and landslides (10 factors), and used the Boruta algorithm to prioritize the impact of each respective factor on the occurrence of each hazard. Subsequently, flood, landslides, and forest fire susceptibility maps prepared using a Random Forest (RF) model in the R statistical software. Results indicate that 42.83% of the study area are not susceptible to any hazards, while 2.67% of the area is at risk of all three hazards. The results of the multi-hazard map in Shiraz City indicate that 25% of Shiraz city is very susceptible to flooding, while 16% is very susceptible to landslide occurrences. For four strategic watersheds, it is notable that in the Dorodzan Watershed, landslides and floods are the most important hazards; whereas, flood occurrences cover the largest area of the Maharlou Watershed. In contrast, the Tashk-Bakhtegan Watershed is so sensible to floods and landslides, respectively. Finally, in the Ghareaghaj Watershed, forest fire ranks as the strongest hazard, followed by floods. The validation results indicate an AUC of 0.834, 0.939, and 0.943 for the flood, landslide, and forest fire susceptibility maps, respectively. Also, other accuracy measures including, specificity, sensitivity, TSS, CCI, and Gini coefficient confirmed results of the AUC values.

As a result, many scientists study the phenomenon, and some of them have focused on producing landslide susceptibility maps that can be used by land-use managers to reduce injury and damage. This paper contributes to this effort by comparing the power and effectiveness of five machine learning, benchmark algorithmsâLogistic Model Tree, Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes Tree, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machineâin creating a reliable shallow landslide susceptibility map for Bijar City in Kurdistan province, Iran. Twenty conditioning factors were applied to 111 shallow landslides and tested using the One-R attribute evaluation (ORAE) technique for modeling and validation processes. The performance of the models was assessed by statistical-based indexes including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). Results indicate that all the five machine learning models performed well for shallow landslide susceptibility assessment, but the Logistic Model Tree model (AUC = 0.932) had the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, followed by the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.932), NaÃ¯ve Bayes Tree (AUC = 0.864), ANN (AUC = 0.860), and Support Vector Machine (AUC = 0.834) models. Therefore, we recommend the use of the Logistic Model Tree model in shallow landslide mapping programs in semi-arid regions to help decision makers, planners, land-use managers, and government agencies mitigate the hazard and risk.

Therefore, the pertinently regional landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is of great significance for disaster prevention and mitigation. In this study, LSM is prepared by using a boosting-C5.0 decision tree model. Under the landslide verification of on-site investigations, the study area is divided into accumulation and rock areas, and a total of 12 impact factors are selected. TOL and VIF are employed to determine the multicollinearity among the impact factors. The independent training (80%) and validation (20%) datasets are constructed by random sampling for LSM. ANN, C5.0, and SVM are selected for comparative analysis. The results show that there is no rigorous multicollinearity among the impact factors proposed in this paper. The landslide susceptibility in the study area is divided into low, moderate, high, and very high. The highest susceptibility area distributes along the riverside where the landslide ratio is 37.05% in boosting-C5.0 model. Then the ROCs are expropriated to infer the accuracy of each model. The boosting-C5.0 performs the best with the largest area under the curve in both accumulation and rock areas, reaching at 0.991 and 0.990 in the validation sets, respectively. Finally, the composite modification of the 5 validation sets shows that the uncertainty of boosting-C5.0 is concentrated in the intermediate probability areas of susceptibility.

The results of the FLDA, RF and ADTree models were compared with regard to their applicability for creating an LSM of the Gallicash river watershed in the northern part of Iran close to the Caspian Sea. A landslide inventory map was created using GPS points obtained in a field analysis, high-resolution satellite images, topographicmaps and historical records. A total of 249 landslide sites have been identified to date andwere used in this study tomodel and validate the LSMs of the study region. Of the 249 landslide locations, 70% were used as training data and 30% for the validation of the resulting LSMs. Sixteen factors related to topographical, hydrological, soil type, geological and environmental conditions were used and amulti-collinearity test of the landslide conditioning factors (LCFs)was performed. Using the natural breakmethod (NBM) in a geographic information system(GIS), the LSMs generated by the RF, FLDA, and ADTreemodelswere categorized into five classes, namely very low, low, medium, high and very high landslide susceptibility (LS) zones. The very high susceptibility zones cover 15.37%(ADTree), 16.10%(FLDA) and 11.36%(RF) of the total catchment area. The results of the differentmodels (FLDA, RF, andADTree)were explained and compared using the area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, seed cell area index (SCAI), efficiency and true skill statistic (TSS). The accuracy ofmodels was calculated considering both the training and validation data. The results revealed that the AUROC success rates are 0.89 (ADTree), 0.92 (FLDA) and 0.97 (RF) and predication rates are 0.82 (ADTree), 0.79 (FLDA) and 0.98 (RF), which justifies the approach and indicates a reasonably good landslide prediction.

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) has proven useful in designing landslide mitigation strategies for reducing disaster risk and societal and economic losses, which are essential for land use planning, hazard prevention, and risk management. Recent efforts for improving accuracies of LSM have focused on the utilization of convolutional neural network (CNN) in some image-related tasks, however, due to the inconsistency of data representation, CNN-related studies need to be further explored. In this study, a CNN-based approach for LSM was proposed and experimentally applied in a Jiuzhaigou region where a catastrophic earthquake taken place on 8 August 2017, in Sichuan, China. To address the issue of data representation in the CNN model, we proposed a multiscale sampling strategy which to our knowledge is novel in LSM. In this way, the multiscale training samples (i.e., small scale, medium scale and large scale) were generated from the selected eleven landslide causative factors. The success-rate curve (SRC) and prediction-rate curve (PRC) were applied to validate the LSM results, and three conventional machine learning algorithms, i.e., logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and radial basis function (RBF) neural network, were attempted for comparison. Specifically, MLP neural network achieved the best performance among three machine learning methods, with the area under the SRC (AU-SRC) and PRC (AU-PRC) values of 81.18% and 82.84%, respectively. Nevertheless, the AU-SRC and AU-PRC values of CNN-based approach reached to 97.45% and 88.02%, which were about 16% and 6% higher than that of the MLP neural network, respectively. The present study demonstrated both the excellent goodness-of-fit and strong prediction ability of CNN-based approach for LSM, which also showed the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed multiscale sampling strategy. Additionally, present study revealed that the spatial data close to the landslide location might be more suitable to predict the probability of the landslide occurrence. Finally, we expect that the deep learning method based on multiscale data representation will advance our ability to assess the landslide susceptibility and raise the awareness of landslide disasters.

This study aimed to construct a comprehensive explanatory framework for landslide susceptibility evaluation models based on the SHAP (SHapley Additive explanation)-XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm, analyze the regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity of landslide influencing factors, and discuss the heterogeneity of the generalizability of the models under different landscapes. Firstly, we selected different regions in typical mountainous hilly region and constructed a geospatial database containing 12 landslide influencing factors such as elevation, annual average rainfall, slope, lithology, and NDVI through field surveys, satellite images, and a literature review. Subsequently, the landslide susceptibility evaluation model was constructed based on the XGBoost algorithm and spatial database, and the prediction results of the landslide susceptibility evaluation model were explained based on regional topography, geology, and hydrology using the SHAP algorithm. Finally, the model was generalized and applied to regions with both similar and very different topography, geology, meteorology, and vegetation, to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the generalizability of the model. The following conclusions were drawn: the spatial distribution of landslides is heterogeneous and complex, and the contribution of each influencing factor on the occurrence of landslides has obvious regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity. The generalizability of the landslide susceptibility evaluation model is spatially heterogeneous and has better generalizability to regions with similar regional characteristics. Further explanation of the XGBoost landslide susceptibility evaluation model using the SHAP method allows quantitative analysis of the differences in how much various factors contribute to disasters due to spatial heterogeneity, from the perspective of global and local evaluation units. In summary, the integrated explanatory framework based on the SHAP-XGBoost model can quantify the contribution of influencing factors on landslide occurrence at both global and local levels, which is conducive to the construction and improvement of the influencing factor system of landslide susceptibility in different regions.

However, comparisons of the applications of ML models for LSP from the perspectives of supervised machine learning (SML) and unsupervised machine learning (USML) have not been explored. Hence, this study aims to compare the LSP performance of these SML and USML models, thus further to explore the advantages and disadvantages of these ML models and to realize a more accurate and reliable LSP result. Two representative SML models (support vector machine (SVM) and CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) and two representative USML models (K-means and Kohonen models) are respectively used to scientifically predict the landslide susceptibility indexes, and then these prediction results are discussed. Ningdu County with 446 recorded landslides obtained through field investigations is introduced as case study. A total of 12 conditioning factors are obtained through procession of Landsat TM 8 images and high-resolution aerial images, topographical and hydrological spatial analysis of Digital Elevation Modeling in GIS software, and government reports. The area value under the curve of receiver operating features (AUC) is applied for evaluating the prediction accuracy of SML models, and the frequency ratio (FR) accuracy is then introduced to compare the remarkable prediction performance differences between SML and USML models. Overall, the receiver operation curve (ROC) results show that the AUC of the SVM is 0.892 and is slightly greater than the AUC of the CHAID model (0.872). The FR accuracy results show that the SVM model has the highest accuracy for LSP (77.80%), followed by the CHAID model (74.50%), the Kohonen model (72.8%) and the K-means model (69.7%), which indicates that the SML models can reach considerably better prediction capability than the USML models. It can be concluded that selecting recorded landslides as prior knowledge to train and test the LSP models is the key reason for the higher prediction accuracy of the SML models, while the lack of a priori knowledge and target guidance is an important reason for the low LSP accuracy of the USML models. Nevertheless, the USML models can also be used to implement LSP due to their advantages of efficient modeling processes, dimensionality reduction and strong scalability.

This study presents a novel framework for studying the uncertainty of non-landslide samples selection on the LSP results through the slope unit-based machine learning models. In this framework, the non-landslide samples are randomly selected from the non-landslide areas by multiple times (N = 1, 10, 100, 500, 1000, 5000) to construct LSP models and calculate N types of landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs). Afterwards, the statistical analysis is used to represent the uncertainty of LSIs under each non-landslide selection. The maximum probability analysis (MPA) is applied to reduce the uncertainty of non-landslide samples selection in LSP, which calculates the probability of N types of LSIs falling into very high, high, moderate, low and very low landslide susceptibility levels and selects the optimal landslide susceptibility level with the highest probability for each slope unit. Chongyi County in China is selected as the example, slope unit-based logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) models are constructed with 16 conditioning factors. The area under the receiver operating features curve (AUC) and frequency ratio (FR) accuracy are used to evaluate the LSP performance. Results show that the N types of LSIs in each slope unit exhibit a normal distribution rather than one constant value. The uncertainties of LSIs caused by non-landslide samples selection are well represented by statistical analysis. The AUC values of slope unit-based LR/SVM models range from 0.714/ 0.711 (N = 1) to 0.787/0.775 (N = 5000) and increase to 0.867/0.848, meanwhile, the FR accuracies range from 0.772/ 0.763 (N = 1) to 0.815/0.826 (N = 5000) and increase to 0.843/0.861 by the MPA method.

The Stacking ensemble technique was utilized to design a high-performance landslide model by combining three traditional machine learning methods (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT)). We collected 1051 landslide samples and fourteen affecting factors after feature selection. For landslide modelling, the landslides were randomly split into two subsets: 70% samples for training and the rest for validation. Landslide models were assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and statistical measures. The results indicated that the hybrid model was 0.11â0.135 higher than those of traditional machine learning methods in term of the area under the ROC curve (AUC). In general, this hybrid model can generate high-quality landslide susceptibility maps and help to develop policies that reduce the burden of landslides.

To overcome these drawbacks, a semi-supervised multiple-layer perceptron (SSMLP) is innovatively proposed with several processes: (1) an initial landslide susceptibility map (LSM) is produced using the multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) based on the original recorded landslide samples and related environmental factors; (2) the initial LSM is respectively classified into five areas with very high, high, moderate, low and very low susceptible levels; (3) some reasonable grid units from the areas with very high susceptible level are selected as new landslide samples to expand the original landslide samples; (4) reasonable non-landslide samples are selected from the areas with very low susceptible level; and (5) the expanded landslide samples, reasonable selected non-landslide samples and related environmental factors are put into the MLP once again to predict the final LSM. The Xunwu County of Jiangxi Province in China is selected as the study area. Conventional supervised machine learning (i.e. MLP) and unsupervised machine learning (i.e. K-means clustering model) are selected for comparisons. The comparative results indicate that the SSMLP model has a considerably higher LSP performance than the MLP and K-means clustering in Xunwu County.

In this regard, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory combining with the analytic network process (FDEMATEL-ANP), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier were considered. Initially, a landslide inventory map was produced with 2000 landslide and non-landslide points by randomly divided with a ratio of 70%:30% for training and testing, respectively. The geospatial database for assessing the landslide susceptibility was generated with the help of 16 landslide conditioning factors by allowing for topographical, hydrological, lithological, and land cover factors. The ReliefF method was considered for determining the significance of selected conditioning factors and inclusion in the model building. Consequently, the landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) were generated using the FDEMATEL-ANP, NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier models.

Due to the complex nonlinear correlations among environmental factors, traditional machine learning (ML) models have unsatisfactory LSP accuracies. In this letter, a sparse feature extraction network (SFE+) is proposed for LSP. First, the landslides and environmental factors are collected, and frequency ratios of environmental factors are calculated as the model inputs. Second, the input data are passed through the input layer with the dropout, and then, the features are passed through the hidden layers, that is, the k% lifetime sparsity layers. The hidden layers are employed to further sparse these factors to obtain the independent and redundant prediction features as much as possible. Finally, certain classifiers are used to realize the LSP in the study area. SFE-support vector machine (SVM), SFE-logistic regression (LR), and SFE-stochastic gradient descent (SGD) models are built.

However, there is a great need to examine hazards holistically to better manage the complex of threats found in any region. Many regions of the world have complex hazard landscapes wherein risk from individual and/or multiple extreme events is omnipresent. Extensive parts of Iran experience a complex array of natural hazards â floods, earthquakes, landslides, forest fires, subsidence, and drought. The effectiveness of risk mitigation is in part a function of whether the complex of hazards can be collectively considered, visualized, and evaluated. This study develops and tests individual and collective multi-hazard risk maps for floods, landslides, and forest fires to visualize the spatial distribution of risk in Fars Province, southern Iran. To do this, two well-known machine-learning algorithms â SVM and MARS â are used to predict the distribution of these events. Past floods, landslides, and forest fires were surveyed and mapped. The locations of occurrence of these events (individually and collectively) were randomly separated into training (70%) and testing (30%) data sets. The conditioning factors (for floods, landslides, and forest fires) employed to model the risk distributions are aspect, elevation, drainage density, distance from faults, geology, LULC, profile curvature, annual mean rainfall, plan curvature, distance from man-made residential structures, distance from nearest river, distance from nearest road, slope gradient, soil types, mean annual temperature, and TWI. The outputs of the two models were assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, true-skill statistics (TSS), and the correlation and deviance values from each models for each hazard. The areas-under-the-curves (AUC) for the MARS model prediction were 76.0%, 91.2%, and 90.1% for floods, landslides, and forest fires, respectively. Similarly, the AUCs for the SVM model were 75.5%, 89.0%, and 91.5%. The TSS reveals that the MARS model was better able to predict landslide risk, but was less able to predict flood-risk patterns and forest-fire risk. Finally, the combination of flood, forest fire, and landslide risk maps yielded a multi-hazard susceptibility map for the province. The better predictive model indicated that 52.3% of the province was at-risk for at least one of these hazards. This multi-hazard map may yield valuable insight for land-use planning, sustainable development of infrastructure, and also integrated watershed management in Fars Province.

The main purpose of this study is to produce landslide susceptibility map of the Ayancik district of Sinop province, situated in the Black Sea region of Turkey using three featured regression tree-based ensemble methods including gradient boosting machines (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest (RF). Fifteen landslide causative factors and 105 landslide locations occurred in the region were used. The landslide inventory map was randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) dataset to construct the RF, XGBoost and GBM prediction models. Symmetrical uncertainty measure was utilized to determine the most important causative factors, and then the selected features were used to construct susceptibility prediction models. The performance of the ensemble models was validated using different accuracy metrics including Area under the curve (AUC), overall accuracy (OA), Root mean square error (RMSE), and Kappa coefficient.

Yanchang County, a typical landslide-prone area located in northwestern China, was taken as the area of interest to introduce the proposed application procedure. A landslide inventory containing 82 landslides was prepared and subsequently randomly partitioned into two subsets: training data (70% landslide pixels) and validation data (30% landslide pixels). Fourteen landslide influencing factors were considered in the input dataset and were used to calculate the landslide occurrence probability based on the C5.0 decision tree model. Susceptibility zonation was implemented according to the cut-off values calculated by the K-means cluster algorithm. The validation results of the model performance analysis showed that the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) of the proposed model was the highest, reaching 0.88, compared with traditional models (support vector machine (SVM) = 0.85, Bayesian network (BN) = 0.81, frequency ratio (FR) = 0.75, weight of evidence (WOE) = 0.76).

Moreover, few papers have discussed the applicability of the ensemble learning model in landslide susceptibility mapping at the township level. This study aims at defining a robust ensemble framework that can become the benchmark method for future research dealing with the comparison of different ensemble models. For this purpose, the present work focuses on three different basic classifiers: decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron neural network model (MLPNN) and two homogeneous ensemble models such as random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The hierarchical construction of deep ensemble relied on two leading ensemble technologies (i.e., homogeneous/heterogeneous model ensemble and bagging, boosting, stacking ensemble strategy) to provide a more accurate and effective spatial probability of landslide occurrence. The selected study area is Dazhou town, located in the Jurassic red-strata area in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of China, which is a strategic economic area currently characterized by widespread landslide risk. Based on a long-term field investigation, the inventory counting thirty-three slow-moving landslide polygons was drawn. The results show that the ensemble models do not necessarily perform better; for instance, the Bagging based DT-SVM-MLPNN-XGBoost model performed worse than the single XGBoost model. Amongst the eleven tested models, the Stacking based RF-XGBoost model, which is a homogeneous model based on bagging, boosting, and stacking ensemble, showed the highest capability of predicting the landslide-affected areas.

We located 152 landslides using a combination of interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Google Earth (GE), and field surveys. Of the total slide locations, 80% (122 landslides) were utilized for training the selected algorithms, and the remaining 20% (30 landslides) were applied for validation purposes. We employed 17 conditioning factors, including slope angle, aspect, elevation, curvature, profile curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, soil type, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to river, distance to fault, distance to road, river density, fault density, and road density, which were produced from satellite imageries, geological map, soil maps, and a digital elevation model (DEM). We used these factors to produce landslide susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMT), and random forest (RF) models. To assess prediction accuracy of the models we employed the following statistical measures: negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, root-mean-squared error (RMSE), accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Our results indicated that the AUC was 92%, 90%, and 88% for the LMT, LR, and RF algorithms, respectively. To assess model performance, we also applied non-parametric statistical tests of Friedman andWilcoxon, where the results revealed that there were no practical differences among the used models in the study area. While landslide mapping in tropical environment such as Cameron Highlands remains difficult, the remote sensing (RS) along with machine learning techniques, such as the LMT model, show promise for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area. © 2020 by the authors.",Forests,10.3390/f11080830,54,14,Yes,"LOGR,LMT,RF",,"Viet Nam,Iran,Malaysia,Sweden,Canada,China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent publications have popularized data-driven models, particularly machine learning-based methods, owing to their strong capability in dealing with complex nonlinear problems. However, a significant proportion of these models have neglected qualitative aspects during analysis, resulting in a lack of interpretability throughout the process and causing inaccuracies in the negative sample extraction. In this study, Scoops 3D was employed as a physics-informed tool to qualitatively assess slope stability in the study area (the Hubei Province section of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area). The non-landslide samples were extracted based on the calculated factor of safety (FS). Subsequently, the random forest algorithm was employed for data-driven landslide susceptibility analysis, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) serving as the model evaluation index. Compared to the benchmark model (i.e., the standard method of utilizing the pure random forest algorithm), the proposed method's AUC value improved by 20.1%, validating the effectiveness of the dual-driven method (physics-informed data-driven).d.

However, failure to do so can be catastrophic, causing unwanted tragedies such as property damage, community displacement, and human casualties. Research into landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) attempts to alleviate such catastrophes through the identification of landslide prone areas. Computational modelling techniques have been successful in related disaster scenarios, which motivate this work to explore such modelling for LSM. In this research, the potential of supervised machine learning and ensemble learning is investigated. Firstly, the Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA) supervised learning algorithm is trained for LSM and compared against other algorithms that have been widely used for the same purpose, namely Generalized Logistic Models (GLM), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT or GBM), and Random Forest (RF). Next, an ensemble model consisting of all four algorithms is implemented to examine possible performance improvements. The dataset used to train and test all the algorithms consists of a landslide inventory map of 227 landslide locations. From these sources, 13 conditioning factors are extracted to be used in the models. Experimental evaluations are made based on True Skill Statistic (TSS), the Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC) curve and kappa index. The results show that the best TSS (0.6986), ROC (0.904) and kappa (0.6915) were obtained by the ensemble model. FDA on its own seems effective at modelling landslide susceptibility from multiple data sources, with performance comparable to GLM. However, it slightly underperforms when compared to GBM (BRT) and RF. RF seems most capable compared to GBM, GLM, and FDA, when dealing with all conditioning factors.

Landslide features are generally uncorrelated or nonlinearly correlated, resulting in limited LSP performance when leveraging conventional machine learning models. In this study, a deep-learning-based model using the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and conditional random field (CRF) in cascade-parallel form was proposed for making LSPs based on remote sensing (RS) images and a geographic information system (GIS). The RS images are the main data sources of landslide-related environmental factors, and a GIS is used to analyze, store, and display spatial big data. The cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF consists of frequency ratio values of environmental factors in the input layers, cascade-parallel LSTM for feature extraction in the hidden layers, and cascade-parallel full connection for classification and CRF for landslide/non-landslide state modeling in the output layers. The cascade-parallel form of LSTM can extract features from different layers and merge them into concrete features. The CRF is used to calculate the energy relationship between two grid points, and the extracted features are further smoothed and optimized. As a case study, the cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF was applied to Shicheng County of Jiangxi Province in China. A total of 2709 landslide grid cells were recorded and 2709 non-landslide grid cells were randomly selected from the study area. The results show that, compared with existing main traditional machine learning algorithms, such as multilayer perception, logistic regression, and decision tree, the proposed cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF had a higher landslide prediction rate (positive predictive rate: 72.44%, negative predictive rate: 80%, total predictive rate: 75.67%). In conclusion, the proposed cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF is a novel data-driven deep learning model that overcomes the limitations of traditional machine learning algorithms and achieves promising results for making LSPs.

Landslide susceptibility maps, which help to identify which regions in a given area are at greater risk of a landslide occurring, are a key tool for effective mitigation. Research in this field has grown immensely, ranging from quantitative to deterministic approaches, with a recent surge in machine learning (ML)-based computational models. The development of ML models, in particular, has undergone a meteoritic rise in the last decade, contributing to the successful development of accurate susceptibility maps. However, despite their success, these models are rarely used by stakeholders owing to their “black box” nature. Hence, it is crucial to explain the results, thus providing greater transparency for the use of such models. To address this gap, the present work introduces the use of an ML-based explainable algorithm, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), for landslide susceptibility modeling. A convolutional neural network model was used conducted in the CheongJu region in South Korea. A total of 519 landslide locations were examined with 16 landslide-affected variables, of which 70% was used for training and 30% for testing, and the model achieved an accuracy of 89%. Further, the comparison was performed using Support Vector Machine mode, which achieved an accuracy of 84%. The SHAP plots showed variations in feature interactions for both landslide and non-landslide locations, thus providing more clarity as to how the model achieves a specific result. The SHAP dependence plots explained the relationship between altitude and slope, showing a negative relationship with altitude and a positive relationship with slope. This is the first use of an explainable ML model in landslide susceptibility modeling, and we argue that future works should include aspects of explainability to open up the possibility of developing a transferable artificial intelligence model. © 2023 The Authors",Applied Soft Computing,10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110324,13,13,Yes,"SHAP,CNN",,"Australia,Malaysia,South Korea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To construct efficient susceptibility prediction considering different landslide types, Huichang County in China is taken as example. Firstly, 105 rock falls, 350 colluvial landslides and 11 related environmental factors are identified. Then four machine learning models, namely logistic regression, multi-layer perception, support vector machine and C5.0 decision tree are applied for susceptibility modeling of rock fall and colluvial landslide. Thirdly, three different landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) models considering landslide types based on C5.0 decision tree with excellent performance are constructed to generate final landslide susceptibility: (i) united method, which combines all landslide types directly; (ii) probability statistical method, which couples analyses of susceptibility indices under different landslide types based on probability formula; and (iii) maximum comparison method, which selects the maximum susceptibility index through comparing the predicted susceptibility indices under different types of landslides. Finally, uncertainties of landslide susceptibility are assessed by prediction accuracy, mean value and standard deviation. It is concluded that LSP results of the three coupled models considering landslide types basically conform to the spatial occurrence patterns of landslides in Huichang County. The united method has the best susceptibility prediction performance, followed by the probability method and maximum susceptibility method. More cases are needed to verify this result in-depth.

Using the four fold of data, the models' outcomes were cross-checked. The locations of existing landslides were detected by general field surveys and relevant records. 220 previous landslide locations were obtained, presented as an inventory map, and divided into four folds to calibrate and authenticate the models. For modelling the landslide susceptibility, twelve LCFs (landslide conditioning factors) were used. Two statistical methods, i.e. the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE), one statistical test, i.e. the Freidman rank test, as well as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), efficiency and precision were used for authenticating the produced landslide models. The results of the accuracy measures revealed that all models have good potential to recognize the landslide susceptibility in the Garhwal Himalayan region. Among these models, the ensemble model achieved a higher accuracy (precision: 0.829, efficiency: 0.833, AUC: 89.460, RMSE: 0.069 and MAE: 0.141) than the individual models. According to the outcome of the ensemble simulations, the BRT model's predictive accuracy was enhanced by integrating it with the statistical model (CP). The study showed that the areas of fallow land, plantation fields, and roadsides with elevations of more than 1500 m. with steep slopes of 24Â° to 87Â° and eroding hills are highly susceptible to landslides.

However, there are still challenges remain in landslide mapping due to the availability of limited inventory data. In this paper, a novel method that improves the performance of machine learning techniques is presented. The proposed method creates synthetic inventory data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for improving the prediction of landslides. In this research, landslide inventory data of 156 landslide locations were identified in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia, taken from previous projects the authors worked on. Elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, total curvature, lithology, land use and land cover (LULC), distance to the road, distance to the river, stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), terrain roughness index (TRI), topographic wetness index (TWI) and vegetation density are geo-environmental factors considered in this study based on suggestions from previous works on Cameron Highlands. To show the capability of GANs in improving landslide prediction models, this study tests the proposed GAN model with benchmark models namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Bagging ensemble models with ANN and SVM models. These models were validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The DT, RF, SVM, ANN and Bagging ensemble could achieve the AUROC values of (0.90, 0.94, 0.86, 0.69 and 0.82) for the training; and the AUROC of (0.76, 0.81, 0.85, 0.72 and 0.75) for the test, subsequently.

Using the additional samples improved the test accuracy of all the models except SVM. As a result, in data-scarce environments, this research showed that utilizing GANs to generate supplementary samples is promising because it can improve the predictive capability of common landslide prediction models.

Different expressions of landslide boundaries and spatial shapes may lead to substantial differences in the distribution of predicted landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs); moreover, the presence of irregular landslide boundaries and spatial shapes introduces uncertainties into the LSM. To address this issue by accurately drawing polygonal boundaries based on LSM, the uncertainty patterns of LSM modelling under two different landslide boundaries and spatial shapes, such as landslide points and circles, are compared. Within the research area of Ruijin City in China, a total of 370 landslides with accurate boundary information are obtained, and 10 environmental factors, such as slope and lithology, are selected. Then, correlation analyses between the landslide boundary shapes and selected environmental factors are performed via the frequency ratio (FR) method. Next, a support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) based on landslide points, circles and accurate landslide polygons are constructed as point-, circle- and polygon-based SVM and RF models, respectively, to address LSM. Finally, the prediction capabilities of the above models are compared by computing their statistical accuracy using receiver operating characteristic analysis, and the uncertainties of the predicted LSIs under the above models are discussed. The results show that using polygonal surfaces with a higher reliability and accuracy to express the landslide boundary and spatial shape can provide a markedly improved LSM accuracy, compared to those based on the points and circles. Moreover, a higher degree of uncertainty of LSM modelling is present in the expression of points because there are too few grid units acting as model input variables. Additionally, the expression of the landslide boundary as circles introduces errors in measurement and is not as accurate as the polygonal boundary in most LSM modelling cases. In addition, the results under different conditions show that the polygon-based models have a higher LSM accuracy, with lower mean values and larger standard deviations compared with the point- and circle-based models. Finally, the overall LSM accuracy of the RF is superior to that of the SVM, and similar patterns of landslide boundary and spatial shape affecting the LSM modelling are reflected in the SVM and RF models.

The former are optimized to produce interpretable results, whereas the latter seeks to maximize the predictive performance of the task at hand. This is valid for any scientific field and for any method belonging to the two categories mentioned above. When attempting to predict natural hazards, this difference has lead researchers to make drastic decisions on which aspect to prioritize, a difficult choice to make. In fact, one would always seek the highest performance because at higher performances correspond better decisions for disaster risk reduction. However, scientists also wish to understand the results, as a way to rely on the tool they developed. Today, very recent development in deep learning have brought forward a new generation of interpretable artificial intelligence, where the prediction power typical of machine learning tools is equipped with a level of explanatory power typical of statistical approaches.

For the purpose of exploring feature fusion based CNN models with greater reliability in LSM, this study proposes an ensemble model based on channel-expanded pre-trained CNN and traditional machine learning model (CPCNN-ML).

Experimental results show that CPCNN-ML has ability to predict landslide occurrence with high reliability, especially the CPCNN-ML based on random forest. Contrast experiments with self-built CNN and traditional ML models further embody the superiority of CPCNN-ML.

Most past studies involved cell-based analysis that takes landslide incidents as geo-spatial points. Nevertheless, given that a landslide is a two-dimensional polygon on maps and a three-dimensional object in the real world, an object-wise assessment is more logical. Fusing with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, this paper proposes a novel AI-powered object-based landslide susceptibility assessment method to address this issue. First, landslide and non-landslide objects are defined based on an optimal object size determined by statistics of historical landslides. Next, landslide and non-landslide samples are constructed by integrating geoenvironmental data layers derived from multi-source data. Subsequently, AI techniques are applied to learn susceptibility prediction based on the prepared samples. To illustrate the proposed method, a comprehensive case study of Hong Kong is conducted, in which six AI algorithms are evaluated including logistic regression (area under curve, AUC = 0.949), random forest (AUC = 0.951), LogitBoost (AUC = 0.958), convolutional neural network (CNN) (AUC = 0.966), bidirectional long short-term memory architecture of recurrent neural network (BiLSTM-RNN) (AUC = 0.966), and CNN-LSTM (AUC = 0.972), among which the BiLSTM-RNN and CNN-LSTM algorithms are applied in landslide susceptibility assessment for the first time. Results confirm that the proposed object-based method outperforms the traditional cell-based method significantly. Equally importantly, the case study produced the first set of AI-based territory-wide landslide susceptibility maps for Hong Kong. These maps can be used as a fundamental tool for quantifying natural terrain landslide risk and identifying susceptible zones where landslide mitigation measures may be needed.

The number of landslides and the level of damage across the globe has been increasing over time. Therefore, landslide management is essential to maintain the natural and socio-economic dynamics of the hilly region. Rorachu river basin is one of the most landslide-prone areas of the Sikkim selected for the present study. The prime goal of the study is to prepare landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) using computer-based advanced machine learning techniques and compare the performance of the models. To properly understand the existing spatial relation with the landslide, twenty factors, including triggering and causative factors, were selected. A deep learning algorithm viz. convolutional neural network model (CNN) and three popular machine learning techniques, i.e., random forest model (RF), artificial neural network model (ANN), and bagging model, were employed to prepare the LSMs. Two separate datasets including training and validation were designed by randomly taken landslide and non-landslide points. A ratio of 70:30 was considered for the selection of both training and validation points. Multicollinearity was assessed by tolerance and variance inflation factor, and the role of individual conditioning factors was estimated using information gain ratio. The result reveals that there is no severe multicollinearity among the landslide conditioning factors, and the triggering factor rainfall appeared as the leading cause of the landslide. Based on the final prediction values of each model, LSM was constructed and successfully portioned into five distinct classes, like very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The susceptibility class-wise distribution of landslides shows that more than 90% of the landslide area falls under higher landslide susceptibility grades. The precision of models was examined using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and statistical methods like root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). In both datasets (training and validation), the CNN model achieved the maximum AUC value of 0.903 and 0.939, respectively. The lowest value of RMSE and MAE also reveals the better performance of the CNN model. So, it can be concluded that all the models have performed well, but the CNN model has outperformed the other models in terms of precision.

The result shows that the CNN can obtain the highest accuracy (86.41%) and the highest AUC (0.9249) in the LSA. The statistical methods represented by the mean and variance of TP and TN perform more firmly on the possibility of landslide occurrence. Furthermore, the LSMs show that all models can successfully identify most of the landslide points, but for areas with a low frequency of landslides, some models are insufficient. The CNN model demonstrates better results in the recognition of the landslides’ cluster region, this is also related to the convolution operation that takes the surrounding environment information into account. The higher accuracy and more concentrative possibility of CNN in LSA is of great significance for disaster prevention and mitigation, which can help the efficient use of human and material resources. Although CNN performs better than other methods, there are still some limitations, the identification of low-cluster landside areas can be enhanced by improving the CNN model. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15030798,10,10,Yes,"CNN,MLPNN,AB,RF,NB,DT,GBDT",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment. © 2020 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs12152505,38,10,Yes,"ANN,GBM,RF,MENT",,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments were conducted in the Kurseong region, a part of Darjeeling Himalaya as a study area. Previous landslide sites were identified through field survey and previous records. Total 273 landslide sites were compiled and considered for the landslide inventory map to calibrate as well as validate the models. Seventeen landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were used for landslide susceptibility modelling, i.e. slope degree, elevation, aspect, curvature, rainfall, geological structure, lineament, distance to main roads, soil texture, soil depth, earthquake zone, land-use/land-cover, drainage density, stream power index, sediment transport index, and topographic wetness index. The generated landslide susceptibility maps were validated applying the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Proportion Correctly Classified (PCC) and the seed cell area index (SCAI). The results revealed that prediction rates are 89.47%, 91.81%, and 94.45% with standard error 0.0359, 0.0289 and 0.0183 respectively for WoE, SVM and ensemble WoE-SVM models. The study shows that the fellow land, plantation area, roads side areas and denudation structural hills having elevation more than 1500 m and 24Â° to 69Â° slopes are extremely susceptible to landslides. The comparison of the produced landslide maps revealed that all the applicable models have committed accuracy for studying sensitivity in Kurseong region of Darjeeling Himalaya. The ensemble model has better capability than the other two models. The results may be helpful for landslide risk mitigation in the Kurseong and its surrounding region having similar terrain region and geological conditions.

Uncertainties in the results of various landslide susceptibility models create challenges in selecting the most suitable method to manage this complex natural phenomenon. This study aimed to propose an approach to reduce uncertainties in landslide prediction, diagnosing spatial agreement in machine learning-based landslide susceptibility maps. It first developed landslide susceptibility maps of Coxâs Bazar district of Bangladesh, applying four machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), featuring hyperparameter optimization of 12 landslide conditioning factors. The results of all the four models yielded very high prediction accuracy, with the area under the curve (AUC) values range between 0.93 to 0.96. The assessment of spatial agreement of landslide predictions showed that the pixel-wise correlation coefficients of landslide probability between various models range from 0.69 to 0.85, indicating the uncertainty in predicted landslides by various models, despite their considerable prediction accuracy. The uncertainty was addressed by establishing a Logistic Regression (LR) model, incorporating the binary landslide inventory data as the dependent variable and the results of the four landslide susceptibility models as independent variables. The outcomes indicated that the RF model had the highest influence in predicting the observed landslide locations, followed by the MLP, SVM, and KNN models. Finally, a combined landslide susceptibility map was developed by integrating the results of the four machine learning-based landslide predictions. The combined map resulted in better spatial agreement (correlation coefficients range between 0.88 and 0.92) and greater prediction accuracy (0.97) compared to the individual models. The modelling approach followed in this study would be useful in minimizing uncertainties of various methods and improving landslide predictions. Â© 2020 by the authors.

High-performance-based hazard prediction models, therefore, are urgently required to prevent related hazards and manage potential emergencies. Current researches mainly focus on susceptibility of single hazard but ignore that different types of geological hazards might occur simultaneously under a complex environment. Here, we firstly built a multi-geohazard inventory from 2000 to 2015 based on a geographical information system and used satellite data in Google earth and then chose twelve conditioning factors and three machine learning methodsârandom forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)âto generate rock fall, landslide, and debris flow susceptibility maps. The results show that debris flow models presented the best prediction capabilities [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC 0.95)], followed by rock fall (AUC 0.94) and landslide (AUC 0.85). Additionally, XGBoost outperformed the other two methods with the highest AUC of 0.93. All three methods with AUC values larger than 0.84 suggest that these models have fairly good performance to assess geological hazards susceptibility. Finally, evolution index was constructed based on a joint probability of these three hazard models to predict the evolution tendency of 35 unstable slopes in Jiuzhaigou. The results show that these unstable slopes are likely to evolve into debris flows with a probability of 46%, followed by landslides (43%) and rock falls (29%). Higher susceptibility areas for geohazards were mainly located in the southeast and middle of Jiuzhaigou, implying geohazards prevention and mitigation measures should be taken there in near future.

A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments.

So, the main goal of this survey was to present a method to synthesize three natural hazards in one multi-hazard map and its evaluation for hazard management and land use planning. To test this methodology, we took as study area the Gorganrood Watershed, located in the Golestan Province (Iran). First, an inventory map of three different types of hazards including flood, landslides, and gullies was prepared using field surveys and different official reports. To generate the susceptibility maps, a total of 17 geo-environmental factors were selected as predictors using the MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) machine learning technique. The accuracy of the predictive models was evaluated by drawing receiver operating characteristic-ROC curves and calculating the area under the ROC curve-AUCROC. The MaxEnt model not only implemented superbly in the degree of fitting, but also obtained significant results in predictive performance. Variables importance of the three studied types of hazards showed that river density, distance from streams, and elevation were the most important factors for flood, respectively. Lithological units, elevation, and annual mean rainfall were relevant for detecting landslides. On the other hand, annual mean rainfall, elevation, and lithological units were used for gully erosion mapping in this study area. Finally, by combining the flood, landslides, and gully erosion susceptibility maps, an integrated multi-hazard map was created. The results demonstrated that 60% of the area is subjected to hazards, reaching a proportion of landslides up to 21.2% in the whole territory.

Each year it causes fatalities, casualties and economic and social losses on large populated areas. Accurate short-term predictions of landslides can be extremely important and useful, in order to both provide local authorities with efficient prediction/early warning and increase the resilience to manage emergencies. There is an extensive literature addressing the problem of computing landslide susceptibility maps (which is a classification problem exploiting a large range of static features) and only few on actual short terms predictions (spatial and temporal). The short-term prediction models are still empirical and obtain unsatisfactory results, also in the identification of the predictors. The new aspects addressed in this paper are: (i) a short-term prediction model (1 day in advance) of landslide based on machine learning, (ii) real time features as good predictors. The introduction of explainable artificial intelligence techniques allowed to understand global and local feature relevance. In order to find the best prediction model, some machine learning solutions have been implemented and assessed. The obtained models overcome the ones available in literature.

Due to the extremely hazardous geological environment around the highway, landslides, debris flows, collapses, and subsidence are frequent. Among them, debris flows are one of the most serious geological hazards on the Karakoram Highway, and they often cause interruptions to traffic and casualties. Therefore, the development of debris flow susceptibility mapping along the highway can potentially facilitate its safe operation. In this study, we used remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning techniques to map debris flow susceptibility along the Karakoram Highway in areas where observation data are scarce and difficult to obtain by field survey. First, the distribution of 544 catchments which are prone to debris flow were identified through visual interpretation of remote sensing images. The factors influencing debris flow susceptibility were then analyzed, and a total of 17 parameters related to geomorphology, soil materials, and triggering conditions were selected. Model training was based on multiple common machine learning methods, including Ensemble Methods, Gaussian Processes, Generalized Linear models, Navies Bayes, Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Trees, Discriminant Analysis, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Support Vector Classification (SVC) was chosen as the final model after evaluation; its accuracy (ACC) was 0.91, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.96. Among the factors involved in SVC, the Melton Ratio (MR) was the most important, followed by drainage density (DD), Hypsometric Integral (HI), and average slope (AS), indicating that geomorphic conditions play an important role in predicting debris flow susceptibility in the study area. SVC was used to map debris flow susceptibility in the study area, and the results will potentially facilitate the safe operation of the highway. © 2020 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs12182933,35,9,Yes,"GLM,NB,SVM,XGB",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, by using aerial photos and geological field surveys, the 263 landslide locations in the study area were obtained. Next, the identified landslides were randomly classified according to the ratio of 70/30 to construct training data and validation models, respectively. Secondly, based on the landslide inventory map, combined with the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the study area, 14 affecting factors of the landslide were determined. The predictive ability of the selected factors was evaluated using the LSVM model. Using the WoE model, the relationship between landslides and affecting factors was analyzed by positive and negative correlation methods. The above three hybrid models were then used to map landslide susceptibility. Thirdly, the ROC curve and various statistical data (SE, 95% CI and MAE) were used to verify and compare the predictive power of the model. Compared with the other two models, the Sysfor model had a larger area under the curve (AUC) of 0.876 (training dataset) and 0.783 (validation dataset). Finally, by quantitatively comparing the susceptibility values of each pixel, the differences in spatial morphology of landslide susceptibility maps were compared, and the model was found to have limitations and effectiveness. The landslide susceptibility maps obtained by the three models are reasonable, and the landslide susceptibility maps generated by the SysFor model have the highest comprehensive performance. The results obtained in this paper can help local governments in land use planning, disaster reduction and environmental protection. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

A well-defined spatial database, which included 335 landslides and twelve landslide-related variables (elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, distance to faults, distance to river, lithology, and hydrological cover) are considered for the analysis, in the Achaia Regional Unit located in Northern Peloponnese, Greece.

We located 152 landslides using a combination of interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Google Earth (GE), and field surveys. Of the total slide locations, 80% (122 landslides) were utilized for training the selected algorithms, and the remaining 20% (30 landslides) were applied for validation purposes. We employed 17 conditioning factors, including slope angle, aspect, elevation, curvature, profile curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, soil type, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to river, distance to fault, distance to road, river density, fault density, and road density, which were produced from satellite imageries, geological map, soil maps, and a digital elevation model (DEM). We used these factors to produce landslide susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMT), and random forest (RF) models. To assess prediction accuracy of the models we employed the following statistical measures: negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, root-mean-squared error (RMSE), accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Our results indicated that the AUC was 92%, 90%, and 88% for the LMT, LR, and RF algorithms, respectively. To assess model performance, we also applied non-parametric statistical tests of Friedman andWilcoxon, where the results revealed that there were no practical differences among the used models in the study area.

At the outset, for the sample of 1522 investigated landslides and 1522 non-landslides, twenty-two factors were chosen as the initial landslide-conditioning factors to construct a spatial database. Subsequently, the GeoDetector and RFE-RF methods were adopted to eliminate the least effective factors, respectively, with the Geo-RFE-RF model being formulated with the combination factors of these two methods. Finally, the performance of the Geo-RFE-RF and RF model with twenty-two initial factors (In-RF) were compared and assessed, and the higher accuracy model was employed to generate a LSM in a case study area, Fengjie County (China). The results indicate that, the Area Under Curve, Accuracy, Precision, and F1 Score of the test dataset is increased by 0.9%, 0.4%, 1.5%, and 0.3%, respectively, under the Geo-RFE-RF model, as compared to the In-RF model. The conditioning factors used to construct the model have been reduced from twenty-two to thirteen, but the predictive ability of the Geo-RFE-RF model performs better, proving the effectiveness of the hybrid model that combines the factors from GeoDetector and RFE-RF methods. This hybrid model not only considers the spatial pattern characteristics of spatial data for screening factors, but the selected factors are also in good agreement with the adopted machine learning method, offering potential use as a general framework for eliminating redundant and noise factors in LSM across the globe.

Consequently, landslide risk assessment has become requisite for managing the resources in future. This study was designed to develop four ensemble metaheuristic machine learning algorithms, such as grey wolf optimized based artificial neural network (GW-ANN), grey wolf optimized based random forest (GW-RF), particle swarm optimization optimized based ANN (PSO-ANN), and PSO optimized based RF for modeling rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility (LS) in Aqabat Al-Sulbat, Asir region, Saudi Arabia, which observes landslide frequently. To obtain very high precision and robust prediction from machine learning algorithms, the grey wolf and PSO optimization algorithms were integrated to develop new ensemble machine learning techniques. Subsequently, LS maps produced by training dataset were validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve based on the testing dataset. Based on the area under curve (AUC) value of ROC curve, the best method for LS modeling was selected. We developed ROC curve-based sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of the parameters for LS modeling. The Gumble extreme value distribution was employed to estimate the rainfall at 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 year return periods. Then, the landslide hazard maps were prepared at different return periods by integrating the best LS model and estimated rainfall at different return periods. The theory of danger pixels was employed to prepare a final risk assessment of the resources, which have been exposed to the landslide. The results showed that 27â42 and 6â15 km2 were predicted as the very high and high LS zones using four ensemble metaheuristic machine learning algorithms. Based on the area under curve (AUC) of ROC, GR-ANN (AUC-0.905) appeared as the best model for LS modeling. The areas under high and very high landslide hazard were gradually increased over the progression of time (26 km2 at the 2 year return period and 40 km2 at the 100 year return period for the high landslide hazard zone, and 6 km2 at the 2 year return period and 20 km2 at the 100 year return period for the very high landslide hazard zone). Similarly, the areas of danger pixel also increased gradually from the 2 to 100 year return periods (37 km2 to 62 km2 ). Various natural resources, such as scrubland, built up, and sparse vegetation, were identified under risk zone due to landslide hazards. In addition, these resources would be exposed extensively to landslides over the advancement of return periods. Therefore, the outcome of the present study will help planners and scientists to propose high precision management plans for protecting natural resources, which have been exposed to landslides.

However, it is difficult to determine appropriate machine learning models for mapping landslide susceptibility. Additionally, it is significant to consider the influences of early effective rainfall on landslide instability in the critical rainfall threshold methods. Furthermore, the uncertainties of the critical rainfall threshold values generated by different calculation methods have not been well explored. To overcome these three drawbacks, first, frequency ratio analysis-based logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models are adopted to predict landslide susceptibility for machine learning model comparison. Second, three different types of critical rainfall threshold methods, namely, cumulative effective rainfall-duration (EE-D), effective rainfall intensity-duration (EI-D) and cumulative effective rainfall-effective rainfall intensity (EE-EI) models, are proposed to calculate the temporal probabilities of landslide occurrence under rainfall conditions based on the concept of effective rainfall. The accuracies and uncertainties of these three critical rainfall threshold methods are discussed. Finally, the landslide susceptibility maps and the critical rainfall threshold values are coupled to predict the rainfall-induced landslide hazards. Xunwu County in China is selected as the study area, and several rainfall-induced landslides are used as the test samples of the proposed landslide hazard warning model. The results show that the RF model has remarkably higher susceptibility prediction accuracy than the SVM and LR models, and the prediction performance of the temporal probabilities of landslide occurrence using the EI-D values are higher than those of EE-D and EE-EI values. Furthermore, rainfall-induced landslide hazard warning is effectively implemented based on the coupling of the susceptibility map and EI-D model.

Due to the complex nonlinear correlations among environmental factors, traditional machine learning (ML) models have unsatisfactory LSP accuracies. In this letter, a sparse feature extraction network (SFE+) is proposed for LSP. First, the landslides and environmental factors are collected, and frequency ratios of environmental factors are calculated as the model inputs. Second, the input data are passed through the input layer with the dropout, and then, the features are passed through the hidden layers, that is, the k% lifetime sparsity layers. The hidden layers are employed to further sparse these factors to obtain the independent and redundant prediction features as much as possible. Finally, certain classifiers are used to realize the LSP in the study area. SFE-support vector machine (SVM), SFE-logistic regression (LR), and SFE-stochastic gradient descent (SGD) models are built. For comparison, principal component analysis (PCA)-SVM, PCA-LR, PCA-SGD, SVM, LR, and SGD models are also built for LSP in Shicheng County, China.

(2) Methods: This paper selects three counties (Chengkou, Wushan and Wuxi counties) in northeastern Chongqing, delineated as the corrosion layered high and middle mountain region (Zone I), and three counties (Wulong, Pengshui and Shizhu counties) in southeastern Chongqing, delineated as the middle mountainous region of strong karst gorges (Zone II), as the study area. This study used a Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of the LightGBM and XGBoost models and construct evaluation models for each of the two regions. The model with high accuracy was selected according to the accuracy of the evaluation indicators in order to establish the landslide susceptibility mapping. The SHAP algorithm was then used to explore the landslide formation mechanisms of different landforms from both a global and local perspective. (3) Results: The AUC values for the test set in the LightGBM mode for Zones I and II are 0.8525 and 0.8859, respectively, and those for the test set in the XGBoost model are 0.8214 and 0.8375, respectively. This shows that LightGBM has a high prediction accuracy with regard to both landforms. Under the two different landform types, the elevation, land use, incision depth, distance from road and the average annual rainfall were the common dominant factors contributing most to decision making at both sites; the distance from a fault and the distance from the river have different degrees of influence under different landform types. (4) Conclusions: the optimized LightGBM-SHAP model is suitable for the analysis of landslide susceptibility in two types of landscapes, namely the corrosion layered high and middle mountain region, and the middle mountainous region of strong karst gorges, and can be used to explore the internal decision-making mechanism of the model at both the global and local levels, which makes the landslide susceptibility prediction results more realistic and transparent. This is beneficial to the selection of a landslide susceptibility index system and the early prevention and control of landslide hazards, and can provide a reference for the prediction of potential landslide hazard-prone areas and interpretable machine learning research. © 2023 by the authors.",Land,10.3390/land12051018,8,8,Yes,"LGBM,XGB,SHAP",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To effectively manage land use and reduce the risk of landslides, it is crucial to conduct susceptibility assessments. To date, many machine-learning methods have been applied to the landslide susceptibility map (LSM). However, as a risk prediction, landslide susceptibility without good interpretability would be a risky approach to apply these methods to real life. This study aimed to assess the LSM in the region of Nayong in Guizhou, China, and conduct a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of landslide susceptibility maps utilizing an explainable artificial intelligence. This study incorporates remote sensing data, field surveys, geographic information system techniques, and interpretable machine-learning techniques to analyze the sensitivity to landslides and to contrast it with other conventional models. As an interpretable machine-learning method, generalized additive models with structured interactions (GAMI-net) could be used to understand how LSM models make decisions. The results showed that the GAMI-net model was valid and had an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is better than the values of 0.85 and 0.81 for the random forest and SVM models, respectively. The coal mining, rock desertification, and rainfall greater than 1300 mm were more susceptible to landslides in the study area. Additionally, the pairwise interaction factors, such as rainfall and mining, lithology and rainfall, and rainfall and elevation, also increased the landslide susceptibility. The results showed that interpretable models could accurately predict landslide susceptibility and reveal the causes of landslide occurrence. The GAMI-net-based model exhibited good predictive capability and significantly increased model interpretability to inform landslide management and decision making, which suggests its great potential for application in LSM. © 2023 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su15043094,8,8,Yes,"GAMI,RF,SVM",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last decade, statistical methods have gradually exerted their impact on mapping the landslide susceptibility to locate the high-risk places of landslide. However, due to the complexity of getting full access to the thematic information in large scenarios, most of these statistical methods generally suffer from overfitting, inadequate representative power, and the inability to transfer the learned representation to other places. To solve these challenges, this study designed an unsupervised representation learning module, which features independence, compactness, robustness, and transferability. Specifically, we first stack restricted Boltzmann machines and denoising autoencoder to unsupervised discover the underlying representations embedded in the thematic maps. Then, we applied the transferring strategy in an adversarial manner to generalize the learned representations to the sample-scarce area. Experimental results and analyses using data in different regions have revealed that the proposed method can be generalized well between different LSM scenarios. In terms of precision, it outperforms other methods by a large margin, e.g., by around 7% compared to multilayer perceptrons with the same configuration, and by 3%-4% to the state of art algorithm random forest. Besides, compared to other methods, the landslide susceptibility map that is predicted by the proposed method featuring smoothness and stableness seems more reliable, and is more according to some prior knowledge that, for example, distance to the drainage, slope, and stratum, should exert dominant effects on the occurrence of a landslide. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,10.1109/jstars.2020.3006192,32,8,Yes,"RBM,AE,RF,SVM,ANN",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many landslide casual factors are often generated from DEMs. Most studies on landslide susceptibility assessments rely on freely available DEMs. However, very little is known about the performance of different DEMs with varying spatial resolutions on the accurate assessment of landslide susceptibility. This study compared the performance of four different DEMs including 30 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), 30-90 m Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 12.5 m Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array Type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and 25 m Survey of Bangladesh (SOB) DEM in landslide susceptibility assessment in the Rangamati district in Bangladesh. This study used three different landslide susceptibility assessment techniques: modified frequency ratio (bivariate model), logistic regression (multivariate model), and random forest (machine-learning model). This study explored two scenarios of landslide susceptibility assessment: using only DEM-derived causal factors and using both DEM-derived factors as well as other common factors. The success and prediction rate curves indicate that the SRTM DEM provides the highest accuracies for the bivariate model in both scenarios. Results also reveal that the ALOS PALSAR DEM shows the best performance in landslide susceptibility mapping using the logistics regression and the random forest models. A relatively finer resolution DEM, the SOB DEM, shows the lowest accuracies compared to other DEMs for all models and scenarios. It can also be noted that the performance of all DEMs except the SOB DEM is close (72%-84%) considering the success and prediction accuracies. Therefore, anyone of the three global DEMs: ASTER, SRTM, and ALOS PALSAR can be used for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area. © 2020 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs12172718,30,8,Yes,"LOGR,RF",,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is, therefore, quite relevant to discuss the pattern of spatial incidence of this phenomenon.

A landslide inventory map along with sixteen landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) was used. Randomly partitioned sets of 70%:30% were used to ascertain the goodness of fit and predictive ability of the models. The contribution of LCFs was analyzed using the RF model. The altitude and drainage density were found to be the responsible factors in causing the landslide in the study area according to the RF model. The robustness of models was assessed through three threshold dependent measures, i.e., receiver operating characteristic (ROC), precision and accuracy, and two threshold independent measures, i.e., mean-absolute-error (MAE) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE). Finally, using the compound factor (CF) method, the models were prioritized based on the results of the validation methods to choose best model. Results show that ANN-RF-LR indicated a realistic finding, concentrating only on 17.74% of the study area as highly susceptible to landslide. The ANN-RF-LR ensemble demonstrated the highest goodness of fit and predictive capacity with respective values of 87.83% (area under the success rate curve) and 93.98% (area under prediction rate curve), and the highest robustness correspondingly. These attempts will play a significant role in ensemble modeling, in building reliable and comprehensive models.

This study investigates the potential application of the stacking ensemble learning technique for landslide susceptibility assessment. In particular, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), logical regression (LR), and naive Bayes (NB) were selected as base learners for the stacking ensemble method. The resampling scheme and Pearson's correlation analysis were jointly used to evaluate the importance level of these base learners. A total of 388 landslides and 12 conditioning factors in the Lushui area (Southwest China) were used as the dataset to develop landslide modeling. The landslides were randomly separated into two parts, with 70% used for model training and 30% used for model validation. The models' performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and statistical measures. The results showed that the stacking-based ensemble model achieved an improved predictive accuracy as compared to the single algorithms, while the SVM-ANN-NB-LR (SANL) model, the SVM-ANN-NB (SAN) model, and the ANN-NB-LR (ANL) models performed equally well, with AUC values of 0.931, 0.940, and 0.932, respectively, for validation stage. The correlation coefficient between the LR and SVM was the highest for all resampling rounds, with a value of 0.72 on average. This connotes that LR and SVM played an almost equal role when the ensemble of SANL was applied for landslide susceptibility analysis. Therefore, it is feasible to use the SAN model or the ANL model for the study area.

Considering complex internal relations among the triggering factors, logistic regression (LR) and shallow neural networks, such as back-propagation neural network (BPNN), are often limited. In this paper, we make a straightforward development that the deep belief network (DBN) based on deep learning technology is introduced to map the regional susceptibility to landslides. Seven factors with respect to geomorphology, geology and hydrology are considered and verified through the collinearity test. A DBN model containing three pre-trained layers of restricted Boltzmann machines by stochastic gradient descent method is configured to obtain the susceptibility to landslides. Susceptibility results evaluated byÂ DBN model are compared with those by LR and BPNN in the receive operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, showing that DBN has a better prediction precision, with a lower rate of false alarms and fake alarms. The case study also indicates different sensitivities of the triggering factors to the landslide susceptibility, that the factors of altitude, distance to drainage network and average annual rainfall have significant impact in mapping the susceptibility to landslides in the region. This research will contribute to a better-performance model for regional-scale mapping for the susceptibility to landslides, in particular, at the area where triggering factors show complex relations and relative independence.

The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the âreach angleâ method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed.

Moreover, this study has extended implications in landslide risk management of the southern WG in the context of repeated extreme rainfall events. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Earth Science Informatics,10.1007/s12145-022-00910-8,7,7,Yes,"DNN,RF",,"India,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, feature engineering (FE) is an important topic in ML studies, but the concept is ignored by most research. In this study, a novel FE framework, including feature selection, feature transformation, feature binning, and feature weighting, is proposed to produce LSMs using eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). For this purpose, first, thirteen landslide conditioning factors used in data preprocessing were utilized for producing LSM models in the study area, Babadag district of Denizli Province in the Aegean region of Turkey. Second, two irrelevant factors eliminated from the input feature subset using the feature selection in the FE framework. Third, features determined as skewed data were converted into symmetric form by applying feature transformation analysis with log transformation. Then, the remaining factors having continuous values were turned into categorical values using the quantile classifier technique. During the feature weighting phase, four different feature weighting methods, namely, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, random forest (RF), non-negative least squares (NNLS), and Frequency Ratio, were utilized to calculate the weights in each subclass of each landslide-related factor. In addition, the proposed feature subsets were also compared with raw data. At the end of process, the XGBoost model constructed with a FR-selected subset (Overall Accuracy (Acc) = 0.907 and area under curve (AUC) = 0.9822) outperformed both raw (Acc = 0.874; AUC = 0.960) and other methods (i.e., RF–FR and SVM–NNLS). Consequently, the study results revealed that the proposed FE approach could be a useful framework to increase the performance of ML techniques in identifying and extracting relevant features to develop highly optimized and enriched models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,10.1007/s00477-022-02330-y,7,7,Yes,"XGB,RF,SVM",,Turkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basin is part of the Jazan region in southwestern Saudi Arabia and is characterized by mountainous terrain. Recently, this area has experienced many extreme natural processes, which become natural hazard events when they intersect with human activities (urban areas and infrastructures). In this work, the probabilities of the three main hazards; landslides, floods, and gully erosion are mapped using machine learning algorithms such as boosted regression tree (BRT), generalized linear model (GLM), Flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), random forest (RF), and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA). Several factors from various sources, including, topographic, geologic, meteorological, hydrologic, and human activities, were incorporated to produce the final multi-hazard susceptibility model. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the best predictive model for each type of natural hazard. AUC values between 80 and 90% indicated that the model was very good, and values above 90% indicated that the model had excellent predictive capability. Based on the accuracy evaluation, the FDA model was found to be the most accurate landslides prediction with an AUC value of (92.7%, excellent performance). The RF model was found to be the most accurate in predicting floods and erosion with AUC values of (97.2% - excellent and 83.3% - very good performance, respectively). Finally, a map of multi-hazard susceptibility was created by coupling of the mentioned three hazards. The results showed that 33.5% of the total area is safe (no-hazard), while 66.5% is characterized by at least a single hazard and a combination of two or three hazards.

Therefore, the preparation of landslide susceptibility maps is necessary in order to mitigate harmful effects. The key objective of this research is to develop landslide susceptibility maps for the Taleghan basin of Alborz province, Iran, using hybrid Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., k-fold cross validation and ML techniques of credal decision tree (CDT), Alternative Decision Tree (ADTree), and their ensemble method (CDT-ADTree), which have been state-of-the-art soft computing techniques rarely used in the case of landslide susceptibility assessments. In this study, 22 key landslide causative factors (LCFs) were considered to explore their spatial relationship to landslides, based on local geomorphological and geo-environmental influences. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used for the identification of variables importance of different LCFs that are more prone to landslide susceptibility. A receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curve with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, and robustness index was used to evaluate and compare landslide susceptibility models. The output of the model performance shows that the CDT-ADTree model is the more robust model for the landslide susceptibility where the AUC, accuracy, and precision are 0.981, 0.837, and 0.867, respectively, than the standalone model of CDT and ADTree model.

The aim of this study was to compare the performance of two decision tree machine learning algorithms including classification and regression tree (CART) and reduced error pruning tree (REPTree) for shallow landslide susceptibility mapping in Bijar, Kurdistan province, Iran. We first used 20 conditioning factors and then they were tested by information gain ratio (IGR) technique to select the most important ones. We then constructed a geodatabase based on the selected factors along with a total of 111 landslide locations with a ratio of 80/20 (for calibration/validation). The performance of the models was checked by the true positive rate (TP Rate), false positive rate (FP Rate), precision, recall, FI-Measure, Kappa, mean absolute error, and area under the receiver operatic curve (AUC). Results of IGR specified that the slope angle and TWI had the most contribution to shallow landslide occurrence in the study area. Moreover, results concluded that although these models had a high goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, the CART model (AUC=0.856) outperformed the REPTree model (AUC=0.837). Therefore, the CART model can be used as a promising tool and also as a base classifier to hybrid with optimization algorithms and Meta classifiers for spatial prediction of shallow landslide-prone areas.

For this purpose we compare the predictive performances achieved using terrain attributes derived from TanDEM-X DEM (12 m resolution and resampled to 30 m), ASTER DEM (30 m), SRTM DEM (30 m), and a DEM (25 m) interpolated from contour lines (1:25.000 map scale), exploiting the capabilities of logistic regression, generalized additive models, random forests and support vector machines. The study was conducted in the Buz?u Sector of the Curvature Subcarpathians of Romania, a region highly susceptible to landslides. While the performances varied little among modelling techniques, the use of different DEMs strongly influenced the cross-validation accuracy of landslide susceptibility models. TanDEM-X (12 m) based susceptibility models outperformed models based on the other DEMs (median Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUROC) values 0.708â0.730). Models using ASTER-derived terrain attributes showed the poorest predictive capabilities (median AUROC 0.568â0.595).

Application of machine learning (ML) with geographic information system (GIS) is a promising fusion of technologies, for spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility with high precision, and has been applied widely in the past. However, the literatures of ML and GIS-based LSZ gives a fuzzy conclusion upon the righteous choice of ML technique among many state-of-the-art techniques, and do not present a probe on the aptitude of ML models for township level LSZ attempts. This research investigates such concern with a case study to figure out a robust technique, which can be a benchmark approach in future case studies and various comparisons strives across the sundry genre of ML. For that, the present attempt has been anchored to four different supervised ML algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM) of neural network (NN) genre, classical ML algorithm of support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ELANFIS) of neuro-fuzzy system genre. The Mussoorie Township, a famed hill station in the Indian State of Uttarakhand was chosen as the area for case study. A total of 13 landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) were produced. Spatial performance of these maps was compared and statistically validated with the help of landslide inventory of the study area. Amongst the LSMs, the LSM-ELANFIS-VII of ELANFIS model with 11 number of membership functions (MF) was found to be in better agreement with all the validation measures performed. In addition to the satisfactory performance on validation, the LSMs produced through ELANFIS display a unique trace of geomorphological features on it along with pragmatic scattering of landslide susceptibility classes - an omen that exhorts graduation of GIS-based LSZ to ensemble neuro-fuzzy ML models.

Landslides at 1354 locations were used to train the models and validate the prediction. Landslides controlling factors include: elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, distance from roads, lineaments density, and topographic wetness index (TWI). Our findings indicate that landslides more likely occurs in the areas of mining activities, close to the roads and the Wadi tributaries due to the high slope angle in some cases.

The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), like many mountainous regions, is the site of multiple and overlapping natural hazards, but the distribution of multi-hazard risk and the populations exposed to it are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution transboundary models describing susceptibility to floods, landslides, and wildfires to understand population exposure to multi-hazard risk across the HKH. These models are created from historical remotely sensed data and hazard catalogs by the maximum entropy (Maxent) machine learning technique. Our results show that human settlements in the HKH are disproportionately concentrated in areas of high multi-hazard risk. In contrast, low-hazard areas are disproportionately unpopulated. Nearly half of the population in the region lives in areas that are highly susceptible to more than one hazard. Warm low-altitude foothill areas with perennially moist soils were identified as highly susceptible to multiple hazards. This area comprises only 31% of the study region, but is home to 49% of its population. The results also show that areas susceptible to multiple hazards are also major corridors of current migration and urban expansion, suggesting that current rates and patterns of urbanization will continue to put more people at risk.

We developed two novel hybrid predictive models that combine the self-organizing, deep-learning group method of data handling (GMDH) with two swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, i.e., cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for spatially explicit prediction of landslide susceptibility. Eleven landslide-causing factors and 334 historic landslides in a 31,340 km2 landslide-prone area in Iran were used to produce geospatial training and validation datasets. The GMDH model was employed to develop a basic predictive model that was then restructured and its parameters were optimized using the CSA and WOA algorithms, yielding the novel hybrid GMDH-CSA and GMDH-WOA models. The hybrid models were validated and compared to the standalone GMDH model by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve and root mean square error (RMSE). The results demonstrated that the hybrid models overcame the computational shortcomings of the basic GMDH model and significantly improved landslide susceptibility prediction (GMDH-CSA, AUC = 0.909 and RMSE = 0.089; GMDH-WOA, AUC = 0.902 and RMSE = 0.129; standalone GMDH, AUC = 0.791 and RMSE = 0.226). Further, the hybrid models were more robust than the standalone GMDH model, showing consistently excellent performance when the training and validation datasets were changed. Overall, the swarm intelligence-optimized models, but not the standalone model, identified the best trade-offs among objectives, accuracy, and robustness.

Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment.

The data showed that every year, around 400 fatalities occur in Himalayan terrain due to landslide. In the current study, we have mapped the landslide susceptibility zones in the segment of Garhwal Himalaya using robust machine and deep learning algorithms. Individual machine and deep learning models have its own limitations like low generation capacity with nonlinear functions to describe the intricate relationship among predictors. In this study total five models i.e., SVM (Support Vector Machine), RF (Random Forest), bagging, ANN (Artificial Neural Network), DLNN (Deep Learning Neural Network) have been used along with twenty landslide controlling factors. Here, the principal objective of the study is to precisely delineate landslide susceptibility zones of the Garhwal Himalaya. The selecting factors have been considered through multi-collinearity test and information gain ratio statistics and the previous landslide points have been taken as training (70%) and testing (30%) dataset.

The data necessary for landslide susceptibility mapping is a collection of landslide causative factors as predictors and landslide inventory as a response variable; however, landslides do not occur everywhere, and the occurrence of landslides is limited in an area. This geophysical phenomenon leads to severely skewed class distribution, wherein the number of landslide samples (minority class) is significantly less than non-landslide locations (majority class). The imbalance in landslide data hampers the predictive ability of learning algorithms, and hence, the final models show poor performance in the class with fewer samples. This work uses two undersampling techniques, namely, EasyEnsemble (EE) and BalanceCascade (BC), for reducing the effect of imbalance in data. The landslides that occurred between 2004 and 2013 are randomly divided into two groups, i.e., 70% of the samples for training and 30% for testing, whereas the landslides that occurred between 2014 and 2017 have been used for validation. The balanced data is used with the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), thereby making four new approaches, i.e., EESVM, EEANN, BCSVM, and BCANN, for susceptibility mapping. We used several metrics, such as recall, geometric mean, precision, accuracy, and Heidke skill score, to evaluate the performance of landslide susceptibility maps. The AUC for imbalanced data with SVM and ANN is 0.50, which shows that the model cannot discriminate between landslide and non-landslide locations. This misclassification is due to a small number of landslide samples and serious class biases. The balanced data using EE and BC methods gives promising results and shows significant improvements, wherein the AUC of EESVM, EEANN, BCSVM, and BCANN is 0.869, 0.918, 0.881, and 0.923, respectively. Among all the methods, the recall and G-mean values were highest for EEANN, which represents the best separation performance of EEANN on landslide samples. Furthermore, we have used the standard error (SE) of AUC and 95% confidence interval to test the significance of various combinations of classification and undersampling schemes. The SE is highest for EESVM and BCSVM among all methods. Based on several accuracy metrics, we conclude that EEANN performs better than all the other methods. The BC-based method does not perform well for landslide susceptibility mapping and provides the highest misclassification of landslide samples. The study shows that the susceptibility maps prepared over balanced data using SVM and ANN show remarkable improvements in accuracy over imbalanced data. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Landslides,10.1007/s10346-022-01998-1,6,6,Yes,"SVM,ANN",,"India,Israel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, a landslide inventory map was created with 206 historical landslide points and 412 non-landslide points, which was randomly divided into two datasets for model training (80%) and model testing (20%). Second, a landslide factor database was initially established by selecting 15 landslide conditioning factors from the topography, hydrology, climate, geology, and artificial activities. Thereafter, the multicollinearity test and information gain ratio (IGR) technique were applied to rank the importance of the factors. Subsequently, we used a series of metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure, area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC), kappa index, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE)) to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the six models.

The landslides caused by the 2005 Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These machine learning models are innovative and can assess environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI, Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5%), 0.893 (89.3%), and 0.790 (79.0%), respectively. Based on the three machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895, and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers. Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and infrastructural areas. © 2022 by the authors.",Civil Engineering Journal (Iran),10.28991/cej-2022-08-02-02,12,6,Yes,"XGB,RF,KNN",,"China,Pakistan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Box 2455, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia",Systematic sample subdividing strategy for training landslide susceptibility models,GIS; Hellinger distance; Landslide modelling; Outlier detection; Sampling strategy,"Current practice in choosing training samples for landslide susceptibility modelling (LSM) is to randomly subdivide inventory information into training and testing samples. Where inventory data differ in distribution, the selection of training samples by a random process may cause inefficient training of machine learning (ML)/statistical models. A systematic technique may, however, produce efficient training samples that well represent the entire inventory data. This is particularly true when inventory information is scarce. This research proposed a systemic strategy to deal with this problem based on the fundamental distribution of probabilities (i.e. Hellinger) and a novel graphical representation of information contained in inventory data (i.e. inventory information curve, IIC). This graphical representation illustrates the relative increase in available information with the growth of the training sample size. Experiments on a selected dataset over the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia were conducted to validate the proposed methods. The dataset contained 104 landslide inventories and 7 landslide-conditioning factors (i.e. altitude, slope, aspect, land use, distance from the stream, distance from the road and distance from lineament) derived from a LiDAR-based digital elevation model and thematic maps acquired from government authorities. In addition, three ML/statistical models, namely, k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT), were utilised to assess the proposed sampling strategy for LSM. The impacts of model's hyperparameters, noise and outliers on the performance of the models and the shape of IICs were also investigated and discussed. To evaluate the proposed method further, it was compared with other standard methods such as random sampling (RS), stratified RS (SRS) and cross-validation (CV). The evaluations were based on the area under the receiving characteristic curves. The results show that IICs are useful in explaining the information content in the training subset and their differences from the original inventory datasets. The quantitative evaluation with KNN, SVM and DT shows that the proposed method outperforms the RS and SRS in all the models and the CV method in KNN and DT models. The proposed sampling strategy enables new applications in landslide modelling, such as measuring inventory data content and complexity and selecting effective training samples to improve the predictive capability of landslide susceptibility models.

Deep learning methods can take advantage of the high-level representation and reconstruction of information from landslide-affecting factors. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based algorithm that combine classifiers of both deep learning and machine learning is proposed for landslide susceptibility assessment. A stacked autoencoder (StAE) and a sparse autoencoder (SpAE) both consist of an input layer for raw data, hidden layer for feature extraction, and output layer for classification and prediction. As a study case, Oda City and Gotsu City in Shimane Prefecture, southwestern Japan, were used for susceptibility assessment and prediction of landslides triggered by extreme rainfall. Results: The prediction performance was compared by analyzing real landslide and non-landslide data. The prediction performance of random forest (RF) was evaluated as better than that of a support vector machine (SVM) in traditional machine learning, so RF was combined with both StAE and SpAE. The results show that the prediction ratio of the combined classifiers was 93.2% for StAE combined with RF model and 92.5% for SpAE combined with RF model, which were higher than those of the SVM (87.4%), RF (89.7%), StAE (84.2%), and SpAE (88.2%). Conclusions: This study provides an example of combined classifiers giving a better predictive ratio than a single classifier. The asymmetric and unsupervised autoencoder combined with RF can exploit optimal non-linear features from landslide-affecting factors successfully, outperforms some conventional machine learning methods, and is promising for landslide susceptibility assessment.

To prevent and mitigate landslides, various models have been introduced to assess landslide susceptibility. In this paper, Hoeffding Tree (HT), a prevailing data stream mining algorithm, was employed to predict landslide susceptibility in Muchuan County, China for the first time. Meanwhile, Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Bayes Network (BN) were applied to produce landslide susceptibility maps for comparison. The model performances were evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUC). To obtain landslide inventory map, 279 landslides data was collected, and training and validation datasets were randomly divided with a proportion of 70% to 30%. Furthermore, twelve conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, distance to roads, distance to rivers, TWI, NDVI, soil, land use and lithology) were selected to construct landslide susceptibility models. Moreover, correlations between conditioning factors and landslides were analyzed using Frequency Ratio (FR). The results showed landslides are prone to occur in areas where human activities concentrate, and all three models exhibited satisfying performances. Concretely, for training dataset, LMT model showed the highest AUC (0.854), followed by HT (0.726) and BN (0.709). However, for validation dataset, LMT and BN models generated similar AUC values (0.761 and 0.764 respectively), and the highest AUC value belonged to HT (0.802). The distributions of landslide susceptibility zones revealed that the interior of county town is mainly seated in low and very low susceptibility zones, whereas regions close to the border suffer high and very high landslide risk. The results acquired in this paper are significant to landslide prevention and urban planning in Muchuan, China. Additionally, this study proved that HT model is a promising classifier for landslide susceptibility modeling.

A total of 186 landslide locations were identified by earlier reports and field surveys. The landslide inventory was randomly divided into two parts: 70% for training dataset and 30% for validation dataset. Based on the multisource data and geological environment, 16 landslide conditioning factors were selected, including control factors and triggering factors (i.e., altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, SPI, TPI, TRI, lithology, distance to faults, TWI, distance to rivers, NDVI, distance to roads, land use, and rainfall). The susceptibility between each conditioning factor and landslide was deduced using a certainty factor model. Subsequently, combined with grid units and slope units, the landslide susceptibility models were carried out by using SVM and PSO-SVM methods. The precision capability of the landslide susceptibility mapping produced by different models and units was verified through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results showed that the PSO-SVM model based on slope units had the best performance in landslide susceptibility mapping, and the area under the curve (AUC) values of training and validation datasets are 0.945 and 0.9245, respectively.

The main idea of this paper is to propose novel integrative models for landslide susceptibility evaluation in a prone area of Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari Province in Iran. To do this, four metaheuristic techniques, namely chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA), crow search algorithm (CSA), satin bowerbird optimization (SBO), and water cycle algorithm (WCA) are used to supervise the training of an artificial neural network (ANN). A spatial database is created by 170 historical landslides and 14 most common conditioning factors. The models are optimized in terms of hyper-parameters and elite ones are then used to produce the susceptibility maps. During the training phase, all models could acquire a reliable understanding of the landslide pattern. The obtained accuracy index of area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC) showed that the maps produced by the WCA-ANN (AUROC = 0.925) and SBO-ANN (AUROC = 0.900) are more accurate than those of the ChOA-ANN (AUROC = 0.851) and CSA-ANN (AUROC = 0.855). Considering this assessment, the suggested hybrid models are reliable enough for landslide susceptibility modeling. Accordingly, the generated susceptibility map can be used for urban planning and generating alert systems over the studied area.

The most common hazards in this region are landslides and debris flows, which result in loss of life and severe infrastructure damage every year. This study assessed geohazards (landslides and debris flows) and developed susceptibility maps by considering four standalone machine-learning and statistical approaches, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Shannon Entropy (SE),Weights-of-Evidence (WoE), and Frequency Ratio (FR) models. To this end, geohazard inventories were prepared using remote sensing techniques with field observations and historical hazard datasets. The spatial relationship of thirteen conditioning factors, namely, slope (degree), distance to faults, geology, elevation, distance to rivers, slope aspect, distance to road, annual mean rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index, profile curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, and land cover, with hazard distribution was analyzed. The results showed that faults, slope angles, elevation, lithology, land cover, and mean annual rainfall play a key role in controlling the spatial distribution of geohazards in the study area. The final susceptibility maps were validated against ground truth points and by plotting Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves. According to the AUROC curves, the success rates of the LR, WoE, FR, and SE models were 85.30%, 76.00, 74.60%, and 71.40%, and their prediction rates were 83.10%, 75.00%, 73.50%, and 70.10%, respectively; these values show higher performance of LR over the other three models.

In recent years, machine-learning techniques have become very popular for producing landslide susceptibility maps. This study aims to compare the performance of these machine learning models with the traditional statistical methods used to produce landslide susceptibility maps. The landslide susceptibility for Ardanuc, Turkey was evaluated using three models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). Ten parameters that are effective in landslide occurrence are used in this study. The accuracy and prediction capabilities of the models were assessed using both the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) methods. According to the AUC method, the success rate of the LR, SVM, and RF models was 83.1%, 93.2%, and 98.3%, respectively.

A traditional statistical certainty factor model (CF), a machine learning support vector machine model (SVM) and random forest model (RF), along with a hybrid CF-SVM model and a CF-RF model were applied to analyze landslide susceptibility. Firstly, 10 landslide conditioning factors were selected, namely slope-angle, altitude, slope aspect, degree of relief, lithology, distance to rivers, distance to faults, distance to roads, average annual rainfall and normalized difference vegetation index. The 23,169 slope units were generated from a Digital Elevation Model and the corresponding 10 conditioning factor layers were produced from both geological and geographical data. Then, landslide susceptibility mapping was carried out using the five models, respectively. Next, the landslide density (LD), frequency ratio (FR), the area under the curve (AUC) and other indicators were used to validate the rationality, performance and accuracy of the models. The results showed that the susceptibility maps produced from the different models were all reasonable. In each map, the LD and FR were greatest in the zones classed as having very high landslide susceptibility, followed by the high, moderate, low and very low landslide susceptibility classes, respectively. From the comparison of the different maps and ROC curves, the RF model based on slope units was the most appropriate for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area. It was also found that the combination of weaker learner model (CF model here) with a stronger learner model (SVM and RF model here) can impact the applicability of the stronger model.

Two well-known machine learning classifiers such as C4.5 decision tree (C4.5) and artificial neural network (ANN) were served as base-learners. A total of five ensemble models, including the Bag-C4.5 model, the Boost-C4.5 model, the Bag-ANN model, the Boost-ANN model, and the Stacking C4.5-ANN model, were constructed by using various ensemble techniques and base-learners. A landslide inventory map and 12 landslide-related factors have been prepared as the spatial database for landslide modeling. The importance of factors was verified using the information gain (IG) method. It turns out that the distance to roads has the greatest contribution to landslide susceptibility assessment. Subsequently, various landslide models were evaluated regarding the goodness of fit, generalization capability, and robustness. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), statistical analysis, and stability index (SI) were used as performance metrics. Evaluation results showed that ensemble learning techniques significantly refined individual landslide models such as the C4.5 (AUC = 0.832) and ANN (AUC = 0.870). In particular, Boosting-based models, e.g., the Boost-C4.5 model (AUC = 0.945) and the Boost-ANN model (AUC = 0.903), gained a higher performance than the Stacking C4.5-ANN model (AUC = 0.900), the Bag-ANN (AUC = 0.892), and the Bag-C4.5 (AUC = 0.878). Additionally, the best modeling robustness was achieved by the Stacking C4.5-ANN method (SI = 1). The results indicate that the Boosting technique has great confidence in strengthening the predictive accuracy for LSM. Also, the Stacking can provide a promising method for stable and improved landslide modeling. Findings from this study may assist to refine the quality of LSM and facilitate risk management for the study area or other similar regions.

This present work intended to propose natural gradient boosting (NGBoost), a novel member of the ensemble learning family, for modeling landslide susceptibility for Macka County of Trabzon province, Turkey. The predictive performance of NGBoost was compared to ensemble-based machine learning methods, namely random forest (RF) and XGBoost using five accuracy metrics including overall accuracy (OA), F1 score, Kappa coefficient, area under curve (AUC) value, and root-mean-square error to evaluate its competence and robustness. Besides, SHAP based on the game theory approach was implemented to interpret the influences of the predisposing factors on the produced model. Results indicated that the NGBoost method utilized for landslide susceptibility mapping problem for the first time had the greatest predictive ability (AUC = 0.898), followed by XGBoost (AUC = 0.871) and RF (AUC = 0.863), and outperformed the XGBoost and RF by approximately 6% in terms of OA.

Spatial and temporal attributes were integrated, selecting potential landslide source areas ranked in terms of hazard. Data integration was also pursued through persistent scatterer interferometry analysis which pointed out areas of interest within potential landslide source areas featured by ongoing ground movement.

The ignorance of this issue will result in some biases and time-invariance in landslide susceptibility. Hence, a novel framework has been proposed to update landslide susceptibility by simultaneously considering the spatial and temporal effects of landslides at the regional scale. In this framework, the landslide inventory of Chongyi County has been divided into pre- and fresh-landslide inventories. According to the LSP results predicted by the support vector machine (SVM) model using the slope unit-based conditioning factors and pre-landslide inventory, a normalized spatial distance index (NSDI) is calculated to quantitatively represent the spatial correlation between landslides and surrounding slope units to develop the SVM-NSDI model. Furthermore, the SVM-Updating model, which incorporates the LSP results of the SVM-NSDI model and fresh-landslide inventory, could be developed to update the LSP results. Subsequently, the confusion matrix, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and frequency ratio (FR) accuracy are used to evaluate the prediction performance of the above LSP models. The F1-score values of the SVM, SVM-NSDI and SVM-Updating models are 0.776, 0.816 and 0.831, respectively. The AUC values are 0.869, 0.903 and 0.914 and the FR accuracies are 0.795, 0.853 and 0.873. It can be concluded that landslide susceptibility is a time-variant variable, which can be updated by considering the spatial correlation between landslides and surrounding slope units as well as the temporal effects of multi-temporal landslide inventory. This study provides a new framework to update landslide susceptibility over time and also provides more accurate LSP results for decision-makers. © 2023 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University",Geoscience Frontiers,10.1016/j.gsf.2023.101619,5,5,Yes,SVM,,"China,Italy,Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we applied four machine learning algorithms, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF), to predict the landslide susceptibility at 30 m spatial scale based on thirteen landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) in a landslide-vulnerable region. Based on inventory landslide points, the classification results were evaluated, and indicated that the performance of the RF (F1-score: 0.85, AUC: 0.92), AdaBoost (F1-score: 0.83, AUC: 0.91), and GBDT (F1-score: 0.83, AUC: 0.88) methods were significantly better than the MLP (F1-score: 0.76, AUC: 0.79) method. The results further indicated that the areas with high and very high landslide risk (susceptibility greater than 0.5) accounted for about 40% of the study region. All four models matched well and predicted similar spatial distribution patterns in landslide susceptibility, with the very high risk areas mostly distributed in the western and southeastern regions. Daoshi, Qingliangfeng, Jinnan, and Linglong towns have the highest landslide risk, with mean susceptibility levels greater than 0.5. The leading contributing factors to landslide susceptibility were slightly different for the four models; however, population density, distance to road, and relief amplitude were generally among the top leading factors for most towns.

Firstly, multiple MLMs were selected and hyperparameters were optimized, and the generated 11 models were cross-integrated to select the best model to calculate landslide susceptibility; by calculating precipitation for different extreme precipitation recurrence periods and combining the susceptibility results to assess the landslide hazard. Using the town as the basic unit, the exposure and vulnerability of the future landslide population under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios in each town were assessed, and then combined with the hazard to estimate the LPAR in 2050. The results showed that the integrated model with the optimized random forest model as the combination strategy had the best comprehensive performance in susceptibility assessment. The distribution of hazard classes is similar to susceptibility, and with an increase in precipitation, the low-hazard area and high-hazard decrease and shift to medium-hazard and very high-hazard classes. The high-risk areas for future landslide populations in Shuicheng County are mainly concentrated in the three southwestern towns with high vulnerability, whereas the northern towns of Baohua and Qinglin are at the lowest risk class. The LPAR increased with the intensity of extreme precipitation. The LPAR differs significantly among the SSPs scenarios, with the lowest in the “fossil-fueled development (SSP5)” scenario and the highest in the “regional rivalry (SSP3)” scenario. In summary, the landslide susceptibility model based on integrated machine learning proposed in this study has a high predictive capability.

On August 8, 2017, a strong Ms 7.0 earthquake occurred in this region, causing some of the mountains in the area to become loose and cracked. Therefore, a survey and evaluation of landslides in this area can help to reveal hazards and take effective measures for subsequent disaster management. However, different evaluation models can yield different spatial distributions of landslide susceptibility, and thus, selecting the appropriate model and performing the optimal combination of parameters is the most effective way to improve susceptibility evaluation. In order to construct an evaluation indicator system suitable for Jiuzhaigou County, we extracted 12 factors affecting the occurrence of landslides, including slope, elevation and slope surface, and made samples. At the core of the transformer model is a self-attentive mechanism that enables any two of the features to be interlinked, after which feature extraction is performed via a forward propagation network (FFN). We exploited its coding structure to transform it into a deep learning model that is more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation. The results show that the transformer model has the highest accuracy (86.89%), followed by the random forest and support vector machine models (84.47% and 82.52%, respectively), and the logistic regression model achieves the lowest accuracy (79.61%).

Increasing landslide samples is the most reliable approach for solving this problem, but it can be expensive, time-consuming, and even unable to conduct. In this study, a novel method is presented that improves the performance of the LS models using the TrAdaBoost transfer learning algorithm. The proposed method transfers useful knowledge from one landslide inventory to another to improve the performance of LS models through which the effort to recollect landslide data is reduced. A database involving 373 historical landslide locations and 5 landslide influencing factors (LIFs, the slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, lithology, and curvature) in the study area (Zigui Basin, China) and 4,120 historical landslide locations and the corresponding LIFs in the source area (Wenchuan-Yingxiu area, China) were used for demonstration. The frequency ratio method was used to tackle problems of feature dissimilarities of LIFs between the study area and the source area. And then, with these quantified influencing factors as inputs, the three TrAdaBoost models (with decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) as basic learners, namely TrAdaBoost-DT, TrAdaBoost-SVM, and TrAdaBoost-RF, respectively), and three conventional machine learning models (DT, SVM, RF) were adopted for showing the performance of the TrAdaBoost in improving the LS models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the existing landslides were used to evaluate the performance of the LS models. The calculated results show that the AUC values of the DT, SVM, RF, TrAdaBoost-DT, TrAdaBoost-SVM, and TrAdaBoost-RF are 0.73, 0.82, 0.83, 0.80, 0.85, and 0.85, respectively; the landslide prediction accuracies of these models are 69%, 77%, 71%, 74%, 87% and 75%, respectively.

The accuracy of the landslide susceptibility prediction model based on machine learning is significantly higher than that of traditional expert knowledge and the conventional mathematical statistics model. The correct and reasonable selection of non-landslide samples in the machine learning model greatly improves the prediction accuracy and reliability of the regional landslide susceptibility model. Focusing on the problem of selecting non-landslide samples in the machine learning model for landslide susceptibility evaluation, this paper proposes a landslide susceptibility evaluation method based on the combination of an information model and machine learning in traditional mathematical statistics. First, the influence factors for landslide susceptibility evaluation are screened by the correlation analysis method. Second, the information value model is used to delimit areas with low and relatively low landslide susceptibility, and non-landslide points are randomly selected. Third, a landslide susceptibility evaluation method combined with IV-ML, such as logistic regression (IV-LR), random forest (IV-RF), support vector machine (IV-SVM), and artificial neural network (IV-ANN), is established.

The RDC consists of two steps: raw classification dataset generation and optimal dataset extraction. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed RDC method, Lushan County of Sichuan Province in China was chosen as the study area to generate the LSM based on three datasets (optimal dataset, original dataset with continuous values, and statistical dataset) using three popular ML methods, namely, convolution neural network, random forest, and logistic regression. The results show that the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of the optimal dataset for the abovementioned ML models are 0.963, 0.961, and 0.930 which are higher than those of the original dataset (0.938, 0.947, and 0.900) and statistical dataset (0.948, 0.954, and 0.897).

Taking Yanchang County of China as example, the landslide inventory and 12 important conditioning factors were acquired. The frequency ratios of each conditioning factor were calculated under five spatial resolutions (15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 ​m). Landslide and non-landslide samples obtained under each spatial resolution were further divided into five proportions of training and testing datasets (9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4 and 5:5), and four typical machine learning models were applied for LSP modelling. The results demonstrated that different spatial resolution and training and testing dataset proportions induce basically similar influences on the modeling uncertainty. With a decrease in the spatial resolution from 15 ​m to 120 ​m and a change in the proportions of the training and testing datasets from 9:1 to 5:5, the modelling accuracy gradually decreased, while the mean values of predicted landslide susceptibility indexes increased and their standard deviations decreased.

The main constraint of susceptibility maps is that they are not adequate for temporal assessments: they are generated from static predisposing factors, allowing only a spatial prediction of landslides. Recently, some methodologies have been proposed to provide spatiotemporal landslides prediction starting from machine learning algorithms (e.g., combining susceptibility maps with rainfall thresholds), but the attempt to obtain a dynamic landslide probability map directly by applying machine learning models is still in the preliminary phase. This work provides a contribution to fix this gap, combining in a Random Forest (RF) algorithm a static indicator of the spatial probability of landslide occurrence (i.e., a classical susceptibility index) and a number of dynamic variables (i.e., seasonality and the rainfall amount cumulated over different reference periods). The RF implementation used in this work allows the calculation of the Out-of-Bag Error and depicts Partial Dependence Plots, two indices that were used to quantify the variables’ importance and to comprehend if the model outcomes are consistent with the triggering mechanism observed in the case of study (Metropolitan City of Florence, Italy). The goal of this research is not to set up a landslide probability map, but to 1) understand how to populate training and test datasets with observations sampled over space and time, 2) assess which rainfall variables are statistically more relevant for the identification of the time and location of landslides, and 3) test the dynamic application of RF in a forecasting model for the spatiotemporal prediction of landslides. The proposed dynamic methodology shows encouraging results, consistent with the actual knowledge of the physical mechanism of the triggering of shallow landslides (mainly influenced by short and intense rainfalls) and identifies some benchmark configurations that represents a promising starting point for future regional-scale applications of machine learning models to dynamic landslide probability assessment and early warning.

In this study, the landslide susceptibility map of the Arhavi, Hopa, and Kemalpa?a districts was produced using the random forest (RF) model, which is widely used in the literature and yields more accurate results compared with other machine learning techniques. A total of 10 landslide-conditioning factors were considered for the susceptibility analysis, i.e., lithology, land cover, slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, topographic wetness index, and distances from faults, drainage networks, and roads. Furthermore, 70% of the landslides on the landslide inventory map were used for training, and the remaining 30% were used for validation.

As a detailed step for this purpose, landslide occurrence was first determined as landslide inventory through aerial photographs with comparative analysis using field survey data; a training set was built for model training through oversampling based on the landslide inventory. A total of 17 landslide influencing variables that influence the frequency of landslides by topography and geomorphology, as well as soil and forest variables, were selected to establish a landslide inventory. Then models were built using DNN, kernel-based DNN, and CNN models, and the susceptibility of landslides in the study area was determined. Model performance was evaluated through the average precision (AP) score and root mean square error (RMSE) for each of the three models. Finally, DNN, kernel-based DNN, and CNN models showed performances of 99.45%, 99.44%, and 99.41%, and RMSE values of 0.1694, 0.1806, and 0.1747, respectively. As a result, all three models showed similar performance, indicating excellent predictive ability of the models developed in this study. The information of landslides occurring in urban areas, which cause a great damage even with a small number of occurrences, can provide a basis for reference to the government and local authorities for urban landslide management.

Many landslide casual factors are often generated from DEMs. Most studies on landslide susceptibility assessments rely on freely available DEMs. However, very little is known about the performance of different DEMs with varying spatial resolutions on the accurate assessment of landslide susceptibility. This study compared the performance of four different DEMs including 30 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), 30-90 m Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 12.5 m Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array Type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and 25 m Survey of Bangladesh (SOB) DEM in landslide susceptibility assessment in the Rangamati district in Bangladesh. This study used three different landslide susceptibility assessment techniques: modified frequency ratio (bivariate model), logistic regression (multivariate model), and random forest (machine-learning model). This study explored two scenarios of landslide susceptibility assessment: using only DEM-derived causal factors and using both DEM-derived factors as well as other common factors. The success and prediction rate curves indicate that the SRTM DEM provides the highest accuracies for the bivariate model in both scenarios. Results also reveal that the ALOS PALSAR DEM shows the best performance in landslide susceptibility mapping using the logistics regression and the random forest models. A relatively finer resolution DEM, the SOB DEM, shows the lowest accuracies compared to other DEMs for all models and scenarios. It can also be noted that the performance of all DEMs except the SOB DEM is close (72%-84%) considering the success and prediction accuracies. Therefore, anyone of the three global DEMs: ASTER, SRTM, and ALOS PALSAR can be used for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area.

This study's main objective was to generate landslide susceptibility map (LSM) considering the hybrid ensemble of machine learning approaches using different sample ratios. Random Forest (RF) as the base classifier an ensemble with bagging, Rotation Forest (RTF), and Random Subspace (RS) Meta classifiers were used for spatial landslide modeling. First, collected 86 landslides locations through field investigation and from Sikkim district disaster office were mapped as a landslide inventory. Collected landslide locations were categorized into training and testing datasets randomly using four sample ratios (50:50, 60:40, 70:30 and 80:20). Based on the four sampling ratios and fifteen conditioning factors, a total of sixteen LSMs were prepared using RF, Bagging-RF (B-RF), RTF-RF and RS-RF in GIS platform.

The primary goal of the present study is to assess and compare four models: classification and regression tree, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), adaptive boosting-decision tree and random forest for the performance of landslide susceptibility modeling. Firstly, a landslide inventory map consisting of 229 historical shallow landslide locations was prepared and the same number of non-landslide points was determined by k-means clustering. Secondly, 12 conditioning factors were considered in the landslide susceptibility modeling. The prediction performance of the four models were estimated by fivefold cross validation and relative operating characteristic curve (ROC), area under the ROC curve (AUC) and statistical measures. The results showed that the GBDT performed best in the training and validation dataset, with the highest prediction capability (AUC = 0.986 and 0.940), highest accuracy value (95.3% and 88.1%) and highest kappa index (0.904 and 0.772), respectively. Therefore, the GBDT was considered to be the most suitable model and applied to the whole study area for LSM. The results of this study also demonstrate that the performance can be enhanced with the use of ensemble learning. The sampling strategy of non-landslide points can be improved by combining with clustering analysis which are more reasonable.

Thus, the intersection of landslide and wildfire susceptibility and the spatial uncertainty of the susceptibility maps were studied in this paper. Reliable landslide and wildfire susceptibility maps are necessary for disaster management and land use planning. This work used three advanced ensemble machine learning algorithms: RF (Random Forest), GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) and AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) to assess the landslide and wildfire susceptibility for SEA. A geo-database was established with 2759 landslide locations, 1633 wildfire locations and 18 predictor variables in total. The perfor-mances of the models were assessed using the overall classification accuracy (ACC), Precision, the area under the ROC (receiver operating curve) (AUC) and confusion matrix values. The results showed RF performs superior in both landslide (ACC = 0.81, Precision = 0.78 and AUC= 0.89) and wildfire (ACC= 0.83, Precision = 0.83 and AUC = 0.91) susceptibility modeling, followed by GBDT and AdaBoost. The overall superiority of RF over other models indicates that it is potentially an efficient model for landslide and wildfire susceptibility mapping. The landslide and wildfire susceptibility were obtained using the RF model. This paper also conducted an overlay analysis of the two hazards. The uncertainty of the susceptibility was further assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV). Additionally, the distance to roads is relatively important in both landslide and wildfire susceptibility, which is the most important in landslides and the second most important in wildfires. The result of this paper is useful for mastering the whole situation of hazard susceptibility and proves that RF is a robust model in the hazard susceptibility assessment in SEA.

Existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods apply self-built CNN with simple structure, which failed to reach CNN's full potential on high-level feature extraction, meanwhile ignored the use of numerical predisposing factors. For the purpose of exploring feature fusion based CNN models with greater reliability in LSM, this study proposes an ensemble model based on channel-expanded pre-trained CNN and traditional machine learning model (CPCNN-ML). In CPCNN-ML, pre-trained CNN with mature structure is modified to excavate high-level features of multichannel predisposing factor layers. LSM result is generated by traditional machine learning (ML) model based on hybrid feature of high-level features and numerical predisposing factors. Lantau Island, Hong Kong is selected as study area; temporal landslide inventory is used for model training and evaluation. Experimental results show that CPCNN-ML has ability to predict landslide occurrence with high reliability, especially the CPCNN-ML based on random forest. Contrast experiments with self-built CNN and traditional ML models further embody the superiority of CPCNN-ML. It is worth noting that coastal regions are newly identified landslide-prone regions compared with previous research.

The Lvliang mountains area, a landslide-prone area in China, was taken as the study area, and ten factors were considered in the influencing factors system. Three basic machine learning models (the back propagation (BP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) models) were integrated by an objective function where the weight coefficients among different models were computed by the gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. 80 and 20% of the landslide data were randomly selected as the training and testing samples, respectively, and different landslide susceptibility maps were generated based on the GIS platform. The results illustrated that the accuracy expressed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the BP-SVM-RF integrated model was the highest (0.7898), which was better than that of the BP (0.6929), SVM (0.6582), RF (0.7258), BP-SVM (0.7360), BP-RF (0.7569), and SVM-RF models (0.7298).

The proposed model consists of two parts; one is the extraction of landslide spatial information using two-dimensional CNN and pixel windows, and the other is to capture the correlated features among the conditioning factors using one-dimensional convolutional operations. To evaluate the validity of the proposed model, two pure CNN models and the previously used methods of random forest and a support vector machine were selected as the benchmark models. A total of 621 earthquake-triggered landslides in Ludian County, China and 14 conditioning factors derived from the topography, geological, hydrological, geophysical, land use and land cover data were used to generate a geospatial dataset. The conditioning factors were then selected and analyzed by a multicollinearity analysis and the frequency ratio method. Finally, the trained model calculated the landslide probability of each pixel in the study area and produced the resultant susceptibility map. The results indicated that the hybrid model benefitted from the features extraction capability of the CNN and achieved high-performance results in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and statistical indices. Moreover, the proposed model had 6.2% and 3.7% more improvement than the two pure CNN models in terms of the AUC, respectively.

However, landslide risk depends on the poorly known environmental and socio-economic factors for regional patterns of landslide occurrence probability and vulnerability, which constitute still a matter of research. Here, a hybrid model is described that couples data mining and multi-criteria decision-making methods for hazard and vulnerability mapping and presents its application to landslide risk assessment in Golestan Province, Northeastern Iran. To this end, landslide probability is mapped using three state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithmsâMaximum Entropy, Support Vector Machine and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Productionâand combine the results with Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process computations of vulnerability to obtain the landslide risk map. Based on obtained results, a discussion is presented on landslide probability as a function of the main relevant human-environmental conditioning factors in Golestan Province. In particular, from the response curves of the machine learning algorithms, it can be found that the probability p of landslide occurrence decreases nearly exponentially with the distance x to the next road, fault, or river. Specifically, the results indicated that p? exp (- ?x) where the length scale ? is about 0.0797 km?1 for road, 0.108 km?1 for fault, and 0.734 km?1 0.734Â km?1 for river. Furthermore, according to the results, p follows, approximately, a lognormal function of elevation, while the equation p=p0-K(?-?0)2 fits well the dependence of landslide modeling on the slope-angle ?, with p0?0.64,?0?25.6?and|K|?6.6Ã10-4. However, the highest predicted landslide risk levels in Golestan Province are located in the south and southwest areas surrounding Gorgan City, owing to the combined effect of dense local human occupation and strongly landslide-prone environmental conditions.

Landslide susceptibility mapping is an essential tool for predicting and mitigating landslides. This study aimed to investigate the application of deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with metaheuristic optimization algorithms, namely the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), to landslide susceptibility mapping. The study area was Icheon City, South Korea, for which an accurate landslide inventory dataset was available. The landslide inventory map was prepared and randomly divided into datasets of 70% for training and 30% for validation. Additionally, 18 landslide-related factors, including geo-environmental and topo-hydrological factors, were considered as predictive variables. The models were compared using area under the curve (AUC) values in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The validation results showed that optimized models based on CNN-GWO (AUC = 0.876, RMSE = 0.08) and CNN-ICA (AUC = 0.852, RMSE = 0.09) outperformed the standalone CNN model (AUC = 0.847, RMSE = 0.12). Nevertheless, the CNN model outperformed previous research that used a machine learning algorithm alone. Thus, the deep learning algorithm with optimization algorithms proposed in this study can generate more suitable models for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area due to its improved accuracy.

The main target of this study is the investigation of a GIS-based LSM in Zanjan, Iran and to explore the most important causative factor of landslides in the case study area. Different machine learning (ML) methods have been employed and compared to select the best results in the case study area. The CNN is compared with four ML algorithms, including random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). To do so, sixteen landslide causative factors have been extracted and their related spatial layers have been prepared. Then, the algorithms were trained with related landslide and non-landslide points. The results illustrate that the five ML algorithms performed suitably (precision = 82.43â85.6%, AUC = 0.934â0.967). The RF algorithm achieves the best result, while the CNN, SVM, the ANN, and the LR have the best results after RF, respectively, in this case study. Moreover, variable importance analysis results indicate that slope and topographic curvature contribute more to the prediction.

Accurate landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is crucial for sustainable development. Machine learning has recently become an important means of LSM. However, the accuracy of machine learning models is limited by the heterogeneity of environmental factors and the imbalance of samples, especially for large-scale LSM. To address these problems, we created an improved random forest (RF)-based LSM model and applied it to Guangdong Province, China. First, the RF-based LSM model was constructed using rainfall-induced landslide samples and 13 environmental factors and by exploring the optimal positive-to-negative and training-to-test sample ratios. Second, the performance of the RF-based LSM model was evaluated and compared with three other machine learning models. The results indicate that: (1) the proposed RF-based model has the best performance with the highest area under curve (AUC) of 0.9145, based on optimal positive-to-negative and training-to-test sample ratios of 1:1 and 8:2, respectively; (2) the introduction of rainfall and global human modification (GHM) can increase the AUC from 0.8808 to 0.9145; and (3) rainfall and topography are two dominant factors in Guangdong landslides.

One important aspect of effectively utilizing these algorithms is tuning the hyperparameters to match the specific task at hand. The selection and configuration of hyperparameters directly impact the performance of machine learning models. Achieving optimal hyperparameter settings often requires a deep understanding of the underlying models and the appropriate optimization techniques. While there are many automatic optimization techniques available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, this article focuses on hyperparameter optimization for well-known machine learning models. It explores cutting-edge optimization methods such as metaheuristic algorithms, deep learning-based optimization, Bayesian optimization, and quantum optimization, and our paper focused mainly on metaheuristic and Bayesian optimization techniques and provides guidance on applying them to different machine learning algorithms. The article also presents real-world applications of hyperparameter optimization by conducting tests on spatial data collections for landslide susceptibility mapping. Based on the experiment’s results, both Bayesian optimization and metaheuristic algorithms showed promising performance compared to baseline algorithms. For instance, the metaheuristic algorithm boosted the random forest model’s overall accuracy by 5% and 3%, respectively, from baseline optimization methods GS and RS, and by 4% and 2% from baseline optimization methods GA and PSO. Additionally, for models like KNN and SVM, Bayesian methods with Gaussian processes had good results. When compared to the baseline algorithms RS and GS, the accuracy of the KNN model was enhanced by BO-TPE by 1% and 11%, respectively, and by BO-GP by 2% and 12%, respectively. For SVM, BO-TPE outperformed GS and RS by 6% in terms of performance, while BO-GP improved results by 5%. The paper thoroughly discusses the reasons behind the efficiency of these algorithms. By successfully identifying appropriate hyperparameter configurations, this research paper aims to assist researchers, spatial data analysts, and industrial users in developing machine learning models more effectively.

In the first step, a deep autoencoder network was used to learn the feature expression of the original landslide data in order to acquire effective features in the data. Next, a multi-scale residual network was constructed; specifically, the model was improved into a deep residual network model by adding skip connections in the convolutional layer.

The findings are: (1) Regarding the model predictive performance, the best predictive performance was demonstrated by the ensemble models Catboost (AUC = 0.823 and Kappa = 0.593) and RF (AUC = 0.821 and Kappa = 0.582), followed by the nonlinear models SVM (AUC = 0.775 and Kappa = 0.520), ANN (AUC = 0.770 and Kappa = 0.486) and C5.0 DT (AUC = 0.751 and Kappa = 0.497), while the linear model LR (AUC = 0.756 and Kappa = 0.456) had a more limited performance. The ensemble model, which uses a tree as its baseline classifier, has a lot of potential for studies into the landslide susceptibility. (2) Regarding the model robustness, the three types of models in nonspatial cross-validation (CV) performed relatively similarly in terms of predictive power, while in spatial cross-validation (SPCV), the linear model LR (median AUC = 0.714) achieved better results than the ensemble and nonlinear models. It implies that when the distribution of landslides is not homogeneous, linear models may be the most robust.

Existing LSM studies applying deep learning (DL) methods have shortcomings such as easy overfitting, slow convergence, and insufficient hyperparametric optimization. In response to these problems, this study proposes an ensemble model based on ant colony optimization strategy and deep belief network (ACO-DBN). In ACO-DBN, DL optimization strategies were added to DBN and their combined parameters were optimized with ACO. Next, Pearson's correlation coefficient and random forest importance ranking methods were utilized to optimize landslide causative factors. Then, the Jiuzhaigou earthquake region was selected as an example to explore the applicability of this model. Besides, we conducted the Wilcoxon signed rank test in order to verify that the differences were statistically significant. In a comprehensive comparative all indexes and landslide density, the model proposed in this article shows good rationality, scientificity, and interpretability.

However, the inventory / data imbalance (DI) problem remains one of the challenges in this domain. This problem exists as a good quality landslide inventory map, including a complete record of historical data, is difficult or expensive to collect. As such, this can considerably affect oneâs ability to obtain a sufficient inventory or representative samples. This research developed a new approach based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) to correct imbalanced landslide datasets. The proposed method was tested at Chukha Dzongkhag, Bhutan, one of the most frequent landslide prone areas in the Himalayan region. The proposed approach was then compared with the standard methods such as the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), dense imbalanced sampling, and sparse sampling (i.e., producing non-landslide samples as many as landslide samples). The comparisons were based on five machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), and the support vector machine (SVM). The model evaluation was carried out based on overall accuracy (OA), Kappa Index, F1-score, and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). The spatial database was established with a total of 269 landslides and 10 conditioning factors, including altitude, slope, aspect, total curvature, slope length, lithology, distance from the road, distance from the stream, topographic wetness index (TWI), and sediment transport index (STI). The findings of this study have shown that both GAN and SMOTE data balancing approaches have helped to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. According to AUROC, the GAN method was able to boost the models by reaching the maximum accuracy of ANN (0.918), RF (0.933), DT (0.927), kNN (0.878), and SVM (0.907) when default parameters used. With the optimum parameters, all models performed best with GAN at their highest accuracy of ANN (0.927), RF (0.943), DT (0.923) and kNN (0.889), except SVM obtained the highest accuracy of (0.906) with SMOTE. Our finding suggests that RF balanced with GAN can provide the most reasonable criterion for landslide prediction. This research indicates that landslide data balancing may substantially affect the predictive capabilities of machine learning models. Therefore, the issue of DI in the spatial prediction of landslides should not be ignored. Future studies could explore other generative models for landslide data balancing. By using state-of-the-art GAN, the proposed model can be considered in the areas where the data are limited or imbalanced. Â© 2021 by the authors.

The results of these methods are sensitive to different factors, such as the quality of input data, choice of algorithm, sampling strategies, and data splitting ratios. In this study, five different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used for LSM for the Wayanad district in Kerala, India, using two different sampling strategies and nine different train to test ratios in cross validation. The results show that Random Forest (RF), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms provide better results than NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) and Logistic Regression (LR) for the study area. NB and LR algorithms are less sensitive to the sampling strategy and data splitting, while the performance of the other three algorithms is considerably influenced by the sampling strategy. From the results, both the choice of algorithm and sampling strategy are critical in obtaining the best suited landslide susceptibility map for a region. The accuracies of KNN, RF, and SVM algorithms have increased by 10.51%, 10.02%, and 4.98% with the use of polygon landslide inventory data, while for NB and LR algorithms, the performance was slightly reduced with the use of polygon data. Thus, the sampling strategy and data splitting ratio are less consequential with NB and algorithms, while more data points provide better results for KNN, RF, and SVM algorithms.

A comprehensive landslide inventory and susceptibility assessment of this region are not available, even though this region is prone to frequent disruption by geological hazards, mainly landslides. To achieve this objective, an inventory map and 12 variables (including geomorphic, geological, hydrological and environmental factors) are created. The inventory dataset is divided to training dataset with 148 landslides (70%) and validation dataset with 64 landslides (30%). Then, 2 machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to learn the internal relationship between the target set (212 landslide locations) and the 12 variables as inputs. The used methods are Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Their performances are assessed through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the standard error (Std. error), and the confidence interval (CI) at 95%. As the main results, RF and XGBoost models give identical predictive accuracy (AUC) of ? 90%. This indicates that the proposed procedure can be useful for handling and monitoring present and future landslides. In addition, the models proposed in this study will be useful for the continuous assessment of land degradation trends for this region.

The objective of this study was to conduct a landslide hazard susceptibility assessment for Ruijin, Jiangxi, China, and to provide technical support to the local government for implementing disaster reduction and prevention measures. Machine learning approaches, e.g., random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs) were employed and multiple geo-environmental factors such as land cover, NDVI, landform, rainfall, lithology, and proximity to faults, roads, and rivers, etc., were utilized to achieve our purposes. For categorical factors, three processing approaches were proposed: simple numerical labeling (SNL), weight assignment (WA)-based and frequency ratio (FR)-based. Then 19 geo-environmental factors were respectively converted into raster to constitute three 19-band da-tasets, i.e., DS1, DS2, and DS3 from three different processes. Then, 155 observed landslides that occurred in the past decades were vectorized, among which 70% were randomly selected to com-pose a training set (TS1) and the remaining 30% to form a validation set (VS1). A number of non-landslide (no-risk) samples distributed in the whole study area were identified in low slope (<1â3Â°) zones such as urban areas and croplands, and also added to the TS1 and VS1 in the same ratio. For comparison, we used the FR approach to identify the no-risk samples in both flat and non-flat areas, and merged them into the field-observed landslides to constitute another pair of training and validation sets (TS2 and VS2) using the same ratio of 7:3. The RF algorithm was applied to model the probability of the landslide occurrence using DS1, DS2, and DS3 as predictive variables and TS1 and TS2 for training to obtain the SNL-based, WA-based, and FR-based RF models, respectively. Verified against VS1 and VS2, the three models have similar overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (KC), which are 89.61%, 91.47%, and 94.54%, and 0.7926, 0.8299, and 0.8908, respectively. All of them are much better than the three models obtained by SVM algorithm with OA of 81.79%, 82.86%, and 83%, and KC of 0.6337, 0.655, and 0.660. New case verification with the recent 26 landslide events of 2017â2020 revealed that the landslide susceptibility map from WA-based RF modeling was able to properly identify the high and very high susceptibility zones where 23 new landslides had occurred, and performed better than the SNL-based and FR-based RF modeling, though the latter has a slightly higher OA and KC. Hence, we concluded that all three RF models achieve reasonable risk prediction, but WA-based and FR-based RF modeling deserves a recommendation for application elsewhere. The results of this study may serve as reference for the local authorities in prevention and early warning of landslide hazards. Â© 2021 by the authors.

In this study we used high-precision remote sensing images before and after continuous heavy rainfall in southern Tianshui, China, from 20 June to 25 July 2013, to produce an inventory of 14,397 shallow landslides. Based on the results of landslide inventory, we utilized machine learning and the geographic information system (GIS) to map landslide susceptibility in this area and evaluated the relative weight of various factors affecting landslide development. First, 18 variables related to geomorphic conditions, slope material, geological conditions, and human activities were selected through collinearity analysis; second, 21 selected machine learning models were trained and optimized in the Python environment to evaluate the susceptibility of landslides. The results showed that the ExtraTrees model was the most effective for landslide susceptibility assessment, with an accuracy of 0.91. This predictive ability means that our landslide susceptibility results can be used in the implementation of landslide prevention and mitigation measures in the region. Analysis of the importance of the factors showed that the contribution of slope aspect (SA) was significantly higher than that of the other factors, followed by planar curvature (PLC), distance to river (DR), distance to fault (DTF), normalized difference vehicle index (NDVI), distance to road (DTR), and other factors.

In the third step, the weights of the CF, WoE and EBF models for conditioning factor were calculated separately, and the weights were used to generate the landslide susceptibility maps. The weights of each bivariate model were substituted into the RF and SVM models, respectively, and six integrated models and landslide susceptibility maps were obtained. In the fourth step, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and related parameters were used for verification and comparison, and then the success rate curve and the prediction rate curves were used for re-analysis. The comprehensive results showed that the hybrid model is superior to the bivariate model, and all nine models have excellent performance. The WoEâRF model has the highest predictive ability (AUC_T: 0.9993, AUC_P: 0.8968). The landslide susceptibility maps produced in this study can be used to manage landslide hazard and risk in Linyou County and other similar areas. Â© 2020 by the authors.

Bivariate analysis includes Yuleâs Coefficient, Frequency Ratio, Information Value, and Weight of Evidence, whereas multivariate analysis used is Artificial Neural Network. The input data used for this purpose include an inventory of 421 active landslides and twelve possible causative factors of landslides like lithology, slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, curvature-plan, curvature-profile, distance to drainage, road & thrusts, land use and land cover. Rainfall pattern and the peak ground acceleration (PGA) of area were also considered for the analysis. Using both the bivariate and multivariate methods, it has been observed that ~20â25% of the study area lies in the high and very high landslide susceptible zones, whereas ~50â63% of the study area lies in the low and very low susceptible zone. The high and very high landlslide susceptible zones are mainly confined in the Lesser Himalaya and along the Goriganga River, whereas low and very low susceptible zones are mainly located in the Higher Himalaya, Tethys Himalaya, and the higher elevation of the Lesser Himalaya. Further all the four bivariate methods indicate success rate between 84 and 86%, and the prediction rate between 80 and 86%, and increase with the application of the ANN.

A comprehensive landslide inventory and a landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) along the Karakorum Highway were created in recent research. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) models were used to compare and forecast the association between causative parameters and landslides. These advanced machine learning (ML) models can measure environmental issues and risks for any area on a regional scale. Initially, 74 landslide locations were determined along the KKH to prepare the landslide inventory map using different data. The landslides were randomly divided into two sets for training and validation at a proportion of 7/3. Fifteen landslide conditioning variables were produced for susceptibility mapping. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar persistent scatterer interferometry (PS-InSAR) technique investigated the deformation movement of extracted models in the susceptible zones. It revealed a high line of sight (LOS) deformation velocity in both modelsâ sensitive zones. For accuracy comparison, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve approach was used, which showed 93.44% and 92.22% accuracy for XGBoost and RF, respectively. The XGBoost method produced superior results, combined with PS-InSAR results to create a new LSM for the area. This improved susceptibility model will aid in mitigating the landslide disaster, and the results may assist in the safe operation of the highway in the research area. Â© 2021 by the authors.

However, in most of the previous studies, the distribution of input data was assumed as being, and treated, as normal or Gaussian; this assumption is not always valid as ML is heavily dependent on the quality of the input data. Therefore, we examine the effectiveness of six feature transformations (minimax normalization (Std-X), logarithmic functions (Log-X), reciprocal function (Rec-X), power functions (Power-X), optimal features (Opt-X), and one-hot encoding (Ohe-X) over the 11conditioning factors (i.e., altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, distance to road, distance to lineament, distance to stream, terrain roughness index (TRI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, and vegetation density). We selected the frequent landslide-prone area in the Cameron Highlands in Malaysia as a case study to test this novel approach. These transformations were then assessed by three benchmark ML methods, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGB), logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The 10-fold cross-validation method was used for model evaluations.

Some benchmark models, including the open-source Java decision tree (J48), naive Bayes tree (NBTree), and REPTree were used to compare the designed model.

Based on a literature review and multi-collinearity tests, 16 landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were selected. Of the LCFs, the topographical position index (TPI) had the highest correlation with landslide occurrence. The LSM produced by RF-REPTree revealed that nearly 29% of the study areas have high to very high landslide susceptibility (LS). Statistical analysis of the model results included the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the efficiency test, the true skill statistic (TSS), and the kappa index. ROC demonstrated that the AUC values of RF-REPTree, REPTree, J48, and NBTree models were 0.832, 0.700, 0.695, and 0.759 for succession rate curves and 0.794, 0.740, 0.788, and 0.728 for prediction rate curves, respectively.

To overcome these restrictions, ensembling DL models has often been preferred as a practical solution.

Applying the machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated with the geographic information systems (GIS) has become a trending means for accurate and rapid landslide mapping practices in the scientific community. Support vector machine (SVM) has been the most commonly applied ML algorithm for LSM in recent years. The current study aims to implement different SVM kernel functions including polynomial kernel function (PKF) (degree 1 to 5), radial basis function (RBF), sigmoid, and linear kernels, for a GIS-based LSM over the Tabriz Basin (TB). To this end, a total number of 9 conditioning parameters being involved in the occurrence of the landslide events were determined and utilized. The LSM maps of the TB were generated based on the different SVM kernels and were statistically validated according to the landslide inventory. The findings revealed that the polynomial-degree-2 (PKF-2) model (AUC = 0.9688) outperforms the rest of the utilized kernels. According to the SLM map generated through PKF-2, the northernmost parts of the TB are extremely susceptible to slope failures than the rest; therefore, the developmental policies over these parts have to be taken into account with privileged priority to hinder any humanitarian as well as environmental catastrophes.

Five machine learning methods, including logistic regression, random forest, adaboost tree, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron, are utilized and compared.

To compare different machine learning models for landslide susceptibility mapping, landslide susceptibility maps were developed using traditional (logistic regression) and modern techniques (decision tree). Results show that the spatial pattern of susceptibility map from logistic regression is continuously distributed, whereas that from the decision tree is crisp and sharp. From both models, consistent results show that the most important critical factors are completely different for both the earthquake- and typhoon-triggered landslides.

The novel geographic information web (GIW) application is proposed for dynamically predicting landslide risk in Chiang Rai, Thailand. The automated GIW system is coordinated between machine learning technologies, web technologies, and application programming interfaces (APIs). The new bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) algorithm is presented to forecast landslides. The proposed algorithm consists of 3 major steps, the first of which is the construction of a landslide dataset by using Quantum GIS (QGIS). The second step is to generate the landslide-risk model based on machine learning approaches. Finally, the automated landslide-risk visualization illustrates the likelihood of landslide via Google Maps on the website. Four static factors are considered for landslide-risk prediction, namely, land cover, soil properties, elevation and slope, and a single dynamic factor i.e., precipitation. Data are collected to construct a geospatial landslide database which comprises three historical landslide locations-Phu Chifa at Thoeng District, Ban Pha Duea at Mae Salong Nai, and Mai Salong Nok in Mae Fa Luang District, Chiang Rai, Thailand. Data collection is achieved using QGIS software to interpolate contour, elevation, slope degree and land cover from the Google satellite images, aerial and site survey photographs while the physiographic and rock type are on-site surveyed by experts. The state-of-the-art machine learning models have been trained i.e., linear regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), LSTM, and Bi-LSTM. Ablation studies have been conducted to determine the optimal parameters setting for each model. An enhancement method based on two-stage classifications has been presented to improve the landslide prediction of LSTM and Bi-LSTM models. The landslide-risk prediction performances of these models are subsequently evaluated using real-time dataset and it is shown that Bi-LSTM with Random Forest (Bi-LSTM-RF) yields the best prediction performance.

A QA approach based on the landslide activity after a triggering event can be useful for the performance evaluation of the methods used for LSM production. Landslides triggered by earthquakes can be employed for this purpose as they occur frequently throughout the active seismic regions of the world. After an earthquake occurred in Elazig, Turkey on 24 Jan 2020 (Mw 6.8), several landslides were activated in the mountainous parts. Here, the performances of two state-of-the-art machine learning methods, i.e., the random forest (RF) and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were investigated using the activated landslides. The landslide inventory was derived in a previous study by using pre- and post-event aerial photogrammetric datasets and classified according to their activity types and temporal observations. The classes observed in the pre-event photogrammetric datasets were inactive (L1) and active mass movements (L2). The ones observed in the post-event photogrammetric datasets were new active zones inside the existing landslide (L3) and new activity (L4). Here, only the L1 and L2 type landslides observed in a part of the study area were used for the model training and the LSMs were produced for the whole area to investigate the model transferability. The L3 and L4 type landslides were used for validation. In addition, the area under curve (AUC) values obtained from the methods and the volumetric change maps obtained from the pre- and post-event digital elevation models were also used for the performance assessment. The results demonstrated that RF exhibited higher classification accuracy (AUC = 0.93) than MLP (AUC = 0.87); and accurate LSMs could be produced by using a sub-part of the basin for training.

As a result, future resource management will necessitate landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) using the best conditioning factors. In Aqabat Al-Sulbat, Asir province, Saudi Arabia, the goal of this study was to find optimal conditioning parameters dependent hybrid LSM. LSM was created using machine learning methods such as random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural network (ANN). To build ensemble models, the LR was combined with RF and ANN models. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to validate the LSMs and determine which models were the best. Then, utilising random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), and correlation feature selection, sensitivity analysis was carried out. Through sensitivity analysis, the most relevant conditioning factors were determined, and the best model was applied to the important parameters to build a highly robust LSM with fewer variables. The ROC curve was also used to evaluate the final model. The results show that two hybrid models (LR-ANN and LR-RF) were predicted the very high as 29.67â32.73 km2 and high LS regions as 21.84â33.38 km2, with LR predicting 22.34km2 as very high and 45.15km2 as high LS zones. The LR-RF appeared as best model (AUC: 0.941), followed by LR-ANN (AUC: 0.915) and LR (AUC: 0.872). Sensitivity analysis, on the other hand, allows for the exclusion of aspects, hillshade, drainage density, curvature, and TWI from LSM. The LSM was then predicted using the LR-RF model based on the remaining nine conditioning factors. With fewer variables, this model has achieved greater accuracy (AUC: 0.927). This comes very close to being the best hybrid model. As a result, it is strongly advised to choose conditioning parameters with caution, as redundant parameters would result in less resilient LSM. As a consequence, both time and resources would be saved, and precise LSM would indeed be possible.

These discrete variables have random fluctuations and are sensitive to the errors of point or line elements, leading to a decrease of landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) accuracy. This study proposes continuous conditioning factors such as river density and road density to improve the suitability of the linear factors. Xunwu County in China is taken as an example; 337 historical landslides and 12 conditioning factors are acquired. First, the distance to rivers and roads and other 10 conditioning factors together constitute the original factors of LSP. Second, the distance to rivers and distance to roads are replaced by the road density and river density, respectively, to constitute the improved factors. Third, based on the support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF), original factor- and improved factor-based SVM, LR, and RF models are constructed for comparisons. Finally, the LSP uncertainty is evaluated. Results show that (1) the improved factor-based models have higher LSP accuracies than original factor-based models, indicating that density factors are more feasible than linear factors with more explicit physical meaning; (2) landslide susceptibility indexes distribution features indicate that improved factor-based models reduce the uncertainty of LSP; (3) spatial density factors do not reduce the importance of conditioning factors in both original factor- and improved factor-based models.

As a result, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) plays an important role in the landslide prevention system. Recently, many deep learning (DL) models have been adopted for LSM, but they also face problems such as sensitivity to overfitting and lower mapping accuracy. In this paper, a novel hybrid LSM framework is proposed based on four heterogeneous ensemble learning (HEL) methods with three single DL models: deep belief network (DBN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep residual network (ResNet). The proposed model is tested at the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. 202 historical landslides and ten conditioning factors were selected to construct a geospatial dataset for LSM. The conditioning factors with high-correlation and low importance were removed from the dataset by using the Spearman Correlation Index and random forests. The geospatial dataset was then divided into two subsets: 70% for training and 30% for testing. Then LSM results was carried out by the single and proposed HEL-based models. The quantitative evaluation of the results showed that the proposed HEL-based models improved the LSM accuracy, and outperformed the single DL LSM models. Stacking model achieved the highest AUC value (0.984), highest Kappa (86.95%), highest overall accuracy (94.17%), highest precision (88.87%), highest Matthews correlation coefficient (87.03%) and highest F1-score (91.34%) among all of models for the testing dataset, while the Boosting model obtained the highest Recall value (96.02%). At the same time, HEL-based models proposed in this study also show better stability and can avoid the overfitting effectively. In addition, the Gini index showed that elevation factor contributes most in LSM in the study area. In general, the proposed framework has promising applicability in improving LSM accuracy.

Initially, a landslide inventory of 200 samples was produced along with an additional 200 samples indicating nonlandslide areas and divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) groups using a stratified loop-based random sampling approach. Then, a geospatial database of 12 possible landslide influencing factors (LIFs) was generated, including elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), distance to drainage, distance to fault, distance to road, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, land cover/land use (LCLU), and a geological map of the study area. None of the LIFs were redundant for the modeling, as indicated by the multicollinearity test (tolerance > 0.1) and information gain ratio (IGR > 0). We extended the evaluation measures of each algorithm from area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis to the calculation of performance overall (POA) with the help of precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy (ACC), and Matthewâs correlation coefficient (MCC). The results showed that the SVM was the most promising model (AUC = 0.969, POA = 2669) for the LSM, followed by RF (AUC = 0.967, POA = 2656), GBM (AUC = 0.967, POA = 2623), maxENT (AUC = 0.872, POA = 1761), and LR (AUC = 0.836, POA = 1299). It is important to note that the SVM, RF, and GBM were the top performers, with almost similar accuracy. Thus, each of these could be equally effective for LSM and can be used for risk reduction and mitigation measures in the rugged terrain of Pakistan and other regions with similar topography.

For this aim, three probabilistic models were used namely: multilayer perceptron Artificial Neural Networks with a Back-Propagation algorithm (BPANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and the coupled ANFIS-Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ANFIS-ICA). An all-inclusive landslide inventory map was prepared together with ten pivotal geo-environmental and anthropogenic landslide-controlling factors. Three indices including Pierce Skill Score (PSS), Cohenâs kappa, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) were calculated from the confusion matrix and used to assess the performance of the models. Results in the validation stage revealed that the ensemble of ANFIS-ICA outperformed its counterparts with the respective PSS, kappa, and AUROC values of 0.766, 0.792, 0.966, followed by ANFIS (0.629, 0.666, 0.902), and ANN (0.603, 0.652, 0.866). Regarding the superior model (ANFIS-ICA), about 27% of the study area falls within high landslide susceptibility zones which needs to be considered for further risk mitigation measures and pragmatic actions. Our results pinpointed the outstanding performance of ANFIS-ICA ensemble in landslide susceptibility modeling at the watershed scale. Furthermore, it was found that the ANFIS-ICA model borrows most of its susceptibility pattern and performance from the distance to roads factor, although the total performance of the model is derived from the integration of all the factors. Moreover, this study attested to the advantages of hybrid algorithms and showed that the integration of machine learning models with evolutionary algorithms can be a new horizon to ensemble modeling. Utilization of well-adjusted ensemble models is pivotal for natural resource managers due particularly to their enhanced prediction powers which, in turn, can significantly reduce the social-economic losses emanated from failed predictions.

In this context, research on landslide susceptibility modelling has become a topic of relevance and is in constant evolution. Though various machine-learning techniques (MLTs) have been identified for landslide susceptibility modelling, the uncertainty inherent in the models is rarely considered. The present study attempts to quantify the uncertainty associated with landslide prediction models by developing a new methodological framework based on the ensembles of the eight MLTs. This methodology has been tested at the highlands of the southern Western Ghats region (Kerala, India), where landslides have frequently been occurring. Fourteen landslide conditioning factors have been identified as part of this study, and their association was correlated with 671 historic landslides in the study area. The study used four ensemble models such as the mean of probabilities, the median of probabilities, the weighted mean of probabilities, and the committee average. The weighted mean of probability was proved to be the best model based on the average of 800 standalone MLTs, viz., receiver operating characteristics, true skill statistics, and area under curve with corresponding validation scores. Thereafter, an uncertainty analysis was carried out on the coefficient of variation. A confident map was generated to represent the distinct zonation of landslide susceptibility areas with definite uncertainty scales. Nearly 74% of the past landslides fall in the higher susceptibility-low uncertainty category. It is also inferred that such micro-level zonation based on MLTs may improve the efficiency of landslide susceptibility maps and may help in accurately identifying landslide-prone areas in the future. The confident maps thus generated can be used as a ready reference to the planners for the formulation of landslide adaptation strategies at micro-scales. © 2023 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University",Geoscience Frontiers,10.1016/j.gsf.2023.101657,3,3,Yes,"GLM,GBM,ANN,FLDA,MARS,RF,MENT",,"India,Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article presents the LSMs prepared for the state of Goa using four standard machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). In order to create LSMs, a 78-point landslide inventory, as well as 14 landslide conditioning factors, has been used, including slope, elevation, aspect, total curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, yearly rainfall, Stream Power Index, Topographic Wetness Index, distance to road, depth to bedrock/soil depth, soil type, lithology, and land use land cover. The most pertinent features for the models' construction have been chosen using the Pearson correlation coefficient test and the Random Forest method. The presence of landslides is shown to be strongly influenced by the distance to road, slope of the terrain, and the annual rainfall. The LSMs generated were classified into five levels ranging from very low susceptibility level to very high susceptible. The prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC (AUC-ROC), and True Skill Statistics (TSS) have been used to analyse and compare the LSMs created using various methodologies. All of these algorithms perform pretty well, as evidenced by the overall accuracy scores of 81.90% for LR, 83.33% for SVM, 81.94% for KNN, and 86.11% for RF. SVM and RF are the better approaches for forecasting landslide vulnerability in the research area, according to TSS data. The maximum AUC-ROC of 86% was achieved by the RF algorithm. The results of performance metrics lead to the conclusion that the tree-based RF approach is most appropriate for producing LSM for the state of Goa.

To accomplish this, 15 independent variables including 11 static variables, and 4 climatic dynamic variables that can affect landslide susceptibility were applied to predict landslide susceptibility from 3903 landslide susceptibility locations. These data points were separated into two phases for training and testing. Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) downscaled the data and enabled the combination of nine global climate models (GCMs) under shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) to examine the impacts of climate change. The combination of demographic (SSP) and climatic (representative concentration pathways) scenarios were used (e.g., SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 were used to predict precipitation impacts resulting from climate change at four future dates – 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2090.

The department of Aube in France is well known for several major landslide occurrences. This study focuses on the assessment of Landslide Susceptibility (LS) using the Frequency Ratio (FR) as a statistical method, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, and Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) as machine learning methods in the Aube department, northeast of France. Subsequently, the thematic layers of eight landslide causative factors, including distance to hydrography, density of quarries, elevation, slope, lithology, distance to roads, distance to faults, and rainfall, were generated in the geographic information system (GIS) environment. The thematic layers were integrated and processed to map landslide susceptibility in the study area. On the other hand, an inventory of landslides was carried out based on the database created by the French Geological Survey (BRGM), where 157 landslide occurrences were selected, and then RF and kNN models were trained to generate landslide maps (LSMs) of the study area. The generated maps were assessed by using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC). Subsequently, the accuracy assessment of the FR model revealed more accurate results (AUC = 66.0%) than AHP, outperforming the latter by 6%, while machine learning models results showed that RF gave better results than kNN (<7.3%) with AUC = 95%. Following the analysis of LS mapping results, lithology, distance to the hydrographic network, distance to roads, and elevation were the four main factors controlling landslide susceptibility in the study area.

Therefore, landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) constitute an essential tool for effective hazard management and long-term development planning in landslide-prone areas. The aim of this work is to prepare and compare the LSMs by applying GIS-based statistical and machine learning models for the new city of Sidi Abdellah and surrounding areas (Northern Algeria). We implemented the statistical models of the frequency ratio (FR), statistical index (SI), and weights of evidence (WoE) models, and the machine learning models represented by a logistic regression (LR) model for landslide susceptibility prediction. An historical landslide inventory map was produced using the interpretation of Google Earth satellite images, available historical records, and geological field investigations. The obtained landslides were randomly divided into the training (70%) and validation (30%) processes. Furthermore, 12 influencing factors for landslide occurrence (including precipitation, slope, elevation, distance to drainage, aspect, land use, density of streams, distance to road, lithology, distance to fault, seismicity, and density of roads) were selected to prepare thematic maps and were considered for susceptibility analysis. Subsequently, landslide susceptibility assessment and mapping are performed by considering the inventoried landslide events and their related predisposing factors using LR, SI, WoE, and FR models in GIS. The accuracy of the four models was verified, validated, and compared using the area under curve (AUC) value of the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curves (ROC) method. The validation results showed that all the used statistical models provided a good accuracy in predicting landslide susceptibility than the machine learning models, with the SI model having a higher AUC value of 80.1% than the WoE (78.2%), FR (78.2%), and LR (64.2%) models. Based on these results, we conclude that the established maps can be used as useful tools for land use planning and risk reduction in the urban area of Sidi Abdellah. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Modeling Earth Systems and Environment,10.1007/s40808-022-01633-x,3,3,Yes,LOGR,,Algeria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the problem of sample imbalance in landslide susceptibility assessment, where landslide samples tend to be much smaller than non-landslide samples, is often overlooked. This problem is often one of the important factors affecting the performance of landslide susceptibility models. In this paper, we take the Wanzhou district of Chongqing city as an example, where the total number of data sets is more than 580,000 and the ratio of positive to negative samples is 1:19. We oversample or undersample the unbalanced landslide samples to make them balanced, and then compare the performance of machine learning models with different sampling strategies. Three classic machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, random forest and LightGBM, are used for LSA modeling. The results show that the model trained directly using the unbalanced sample dataset performs the worst, showing an extremely low recall rate, indicating that its predictive ability for landslide samples is extremely low and cannot be applied in practice. Compared with the original dataset, the sample set optimized through certain methods has demonstrated improved predictive performance across various classifiers, manifested in the improvement of AUC value and recall rate.

Multi-hazard susceptibility maps can be used by land-use manager to guide urban development, to minimize the risk of natural disasters. The objective of the present study was to use four machine learning models to produce multi-hazard susceptibility maps in Khuzestan Province, Iran. In this work, four different natural hazards (flood, landslides, forest fire, and earthquake) using support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT), random forest (RF), and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) techniques were created. Effective factors used in the study include elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, rainfall, temperature, lithology, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), wind exposition index (WEI), topographic wetness index (TWI), plan curvature, drainage density, distance from roads, distance from rivers, and distance from villages. The spatial earthquake hazard in the study area was derived from a peak ground acceleration (PGA) susceptibility map. The second step in the study was to combine the model-generated maps of the four hazards in a reliable multi-hazard map. The mean decrease Gini (MDG) method was used to determine the level of importance of each effective factor on the occurrence of landslides, floods, and forest fires. Finally, “area under the curve” (AUC) values were calculated to validate the forest fire, flood, and landslide susceptibility maps and to compare the predictive capability of the machine learning models. The RF model yielded the highest AUC values for the forest fire, flood, and landslide susceptibility maps, specifically, 0.81, 0.85, and 0.94, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Natural Hazards,10.1007/s11069-023-05836-y,3,3,Yes,"SVM,BRT,RF,MENT",,"Iran,Canada,Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accurate modeling and prediction of landslide hazards have been used as some of the vital tools for landslide disaster prevention and control. The purpose of this study was to explore the application of coupling models in landslide susceptibility evaluation. This paper used Weixin County as the research object. First, according to the landslide catalog database constructed, there were 345 landslides in the study area. Twelve environmental factors were selected, including terrain (elevation, slope, slope direction, plane curvature, and profile curvature), geological structure (stratigraphic lithology and distance from fault zone), meteorological hydrology (average annual rainfall and distance to rivers), and land cover (NDVI, land use, and distance to roads). Then, a single model (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest) and a coupled model (IV–LR, IV–SVM, IV–RF, FR–LR, FR–SVM, and FR–RF) based on information volume and frequency ratio were constructed, and the accuracy and reliability of the models were compared and analyzed. Finally, the influence of environmental factors on landslide susceptibility under the optimal model was discussed. The results showed that the prediction accuracy of the nine models ranged from 75.2% (LR model) to 94.9% (FR–RF model), and the coupling accuracy was generally higher than that of the single model. Therefore, the coupling model could improve the prediction accuracy of the model to a certain extent. The FR–RF coupling model had the highest accuracy. Under the optimal model FR–RF, distance from the road, NDVI, and land use were the three most important environmental factors, ac-counting for 20.15%, 13.37%, and 9.69%, respectively.

For this purpose, the geospatial database containing 15 landslide conditioning factors related to regional geo-environmental settings and a landslide inventory with 1330 locations are prepared. The landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) reveal that the south-southeastern portion of Meghalaya, mainly slopes along the southern escarpment, are more susceptible to landslides.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a semi-integrated supervised approach to improve the prediction performance of machine learning (ML) models in landslide susceptibility studies. First, taking the lower reaches of the Jinsha River as the study area, a geospatial dataset consisting of 349 landslides, an equal number of randomly selected non-landslide points, and 12 environmental factors were randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. Then, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and Bayesian-regularized neural network (BRNN) models were built. Second, the three models were combined to form an integrated weighted model. Very high- and low-prone areas were selected and, combined with the prediction results and remote sensing images, landslide and non-landslide samples were identified. The identified samples were then combined with the original samples to form new samples, which were used to sequentially construct the ensemble-supervised K-nearest neighbors (ESKNN), ensemble-supervised random forest (ESRF), and ensemble-supervised Bayesian-regularized neural network (ESBRNN) models. Finally, the area under the curve (AUC), true skill statistic (TSS), and frequency ratio (FR) values were used to test the accuracy of each model. The traditional ML model results and accuracy were improved by the semi-integrated supervised method. The ESRF model had the best prediction effect (AUC = 0.939, TSS = 0.440, and FR = 95.8%). The proposed semi-integrated supervised ML model solved the problems observed in traditional landslide susceptibility studies and provided insights for reducing variations in model applications, expanding landslide data sources, and improving non-landslide sample selection. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1007/s11356-023-25650-0,3,3,Yes,"KNN,RF,BN",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the risk of landslides in Shenzhen is poorly evaluated.

In the experiment, a stacking ensemble learning (SEL) model is constructed based on convolutional neural network (CNN), multilayer perceptron, gated recurrent unit (GRU), and support vector machine regression to generate LSM by using topography, geology, human engineering activities, time-series precipitation, and time-series normalized difference vegetation index. Road network, building distribution density and annual average precipitation data are used to evaluate landslide vulnerability based on entropy weight method. In this article, multiple statistical indicators are used to evaluate the performance of the LSM model, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) deformation data are utilized to verify the LRE results in Shenzhen. The results show that the SEL method has more refined results for LSM, with a best overall evaluation accuracy, especially in the receiver operating characteristic curve, where the accuracy is improved by nearly 8%. In LRE of Shenzhen, very high, high, moderate, low, and very low risk areas account for 0.283%, 0.451%, 0.859%, 36.890%, and 61.517%, respectively.

When predicting SSPL, the landslide samples are far less than the non-landslide samples. This class imbalance makes it difficult to predict the SSPL. This paper proposes an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model based on the dice-cross entropy (DCE) loss function and XGBoost (XGBDCE) or Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBDCE) to ameliorate the class imbalance in the SSPL prediction. We select the earthquake-induced landslides from the 2018 Hokkaido earthquake as a case study to evaluate our proposed method. First, six different datasets with 24 landslide influencing factors and 10,422 samples of a specific part of the landslides are established using remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. Then, based on each of the six datasets, four landslide susceptibility algorithms (XGB, LGB, random-forest (RF) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)) and four class balancing methods (non-balance (NB), equal-quantity sampling (EQS), inverse landslide-frequency weighting (ILW), and DCE loss) are applied to predict the SSPL. The results show that the non-balanced method underestimates landslide susceptibility, and the ILW or EQS methods overestimate the landslide susceptibility, while the DCE loss method produces more balanced results. The prediction performance of the XGBDCE (average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.970) surpasses that of RF (0.956), LGB (0.962), and LDA (0.921). Our proposed methods produce more unbiased and precise results than the existing models, and have a great potential to produce accurate general (e.g., predicting the entire landslide) and detailed (e.g., combining the prediction of the landslide source area with the landslide run-out modeling) landslide susceptibility assessments, which can be further applied to landslide hazard and risk assessments. © 2022 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs14235945,5,3,Yes,"XGB,LGBM,RF,LDA",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the landslide vulnerability of a 6682 km road network in the Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran, using a two-step methodology comprised of: (1) landslide susceptibility mapping using four machine learning methods—boosted regression trees (BRT), multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and random forest (RF); and (2) mapping road exposure to landslides using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) that computed the weight for four buffer zones (0–50, 50–150, 150–300, and > 300 m) from the road network. The combined results of steps 1 and 2 produced a map of the road network vulnerability to landslides that demonstrated that 9.7 km (13.6%) of the road network was located in the very-high vulnerability class. Specifically, the roads of the Ardal and Kohrang counties have been found to be the most vulnerable to landslide risk. The finding of this study could be useful for decision-makers and civil engineering to better manage road networks in terms of landslide risk and community resilience in the aftermath of major landslides. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Earth Sciences,10.1007/s12665-022-10650-z,5,3,Yes,"MARS,BRT,RF",,"Iran,Serbia,Japan,Netherlands,Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most of the evaluation methods ignore the dynamic characteristic factors of landslides, which makes it difficult to obtain reliable prediction results. Taking the upper reaches of the Jinsha River as the study area, this article introduces the deformation data into the landslide characteristic model and proposes an improved landslide susceptibility evaluation method. Four kinds of landslide susceptibility machine learning models were constructed by collecting 20 landslide related factors. The prediction accuracy of machine learning models is compared, and the performance of different models and the improvement of model performance by deformation information are evaluated. The results show that the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost model is better than SVM and logistic regression model. The prediction accuracy of Random Forest and XGBoost model is improved obviously after InSAR deformation is introduced. 96.9 and 93.19% of landslide areas were reasonably classified as high or very high risk levels. Compared with the calculation result of traditional model, the proportion of high and very high risk pixels in landslide area is increased by 2.97 and 1.13%, respectively. In addition, the percentage of high and very high risk areas in the susceptibility evaluation area increased from 15.45 to 16.23% and 18.73 to 21.89%, respectively. The accuracy of Random Forest and XGBoost models increased from 0.793 to 0.878 and 0.776 to 0.812, respectively, and the AUC increased by 0.9 and 1.7%, respectively.

The increased anthropogenic activities in weak geological areas have led to a rise in the frequency of landslides, making landslide management an urgent task to minimize the negative impact. This study aimed to use hyper-tuned machine learning and deep learning algorithms to predict landslide susceptibility model (LSM) and provide sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in Aqabat Al-Sulbat Asir region of Saudi Arabia. Methods: Random forest (RF) was used as the machine learning model, while deep neural network (DNN) was used as the deep learning model. The models were hyper-tuned using the grid search technique, and the best hypertuned models were used for predicting LSM. The generated models were validated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC), F1 and F2 scores, gini value, and precision and recall curve. The DNN based sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was conducted to analyze the influence and uncertainty of the parameters to the landslide. Results: Results showed that the RF and DNN models predicted 35.1–41.32 and 15.14–16.2 km2 areas as high and very high landslide susceptibility zones, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of ROC curve showed that the LSM by the DNN model achieved 0.96 of AUC, while the LSM by RF model achieved 0.93 of AUC. The sensitivity analysis results showed that rainfall had the highest sensitivity to the landslide, followed by Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), curvature, slope, soil texture, and lineament density. Discussion: Road density and geology map had the highest uncertainty to the landslide prediction. This study may be helpful to the authorities and stakeholders in proposing management plans for landslides by considering potential areas for landslide and sensitive parameters.

Using artificial neural networks (ANN) to map these landslides is becoming more frequent every year, being one of the most reliable methods for this. Among the prime influences on the generated maps, sample areas are significantly interesting, since they directly influence the result. In this research, we investigated how the performance of these models is influenced by the use of partial sampling (with landslides caused by a single precipitation event–Single Model) or total (with landslides caused by multiple precipitation events–Full Model). This is one of the main topics that our study approaches. This study aims to evaluate the criteria for landslide sampling and ANN modeling by analyzing the influence of distance on the sampling processes, the use of multiple landslide events, and the relationship between terrain attributes and susceptibility models. To this end, were used five sampling areas (1638 points samples of landslides) in the Serra Geral, southern Brazil, distance buffers in the non-occurrence sampling process (2–40 km), and 16 terrain attributes. The training of the multilayer network was carried out by backpropagation algorithm, and the accuracy was calculated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. The results showed that the greater the distances of the non-occurring samples, the greater the accuracy of the model, with a 40 km buffer resulting in the best models. They also showed that the use of multiple events (Full Model) produced better results than each event used separately (Single Model), obtaining accuracies of 0.954 and 0.931, respectively. This is mainly because there is greater differentiation between occurrence and non-occurrence samples when using multiple events, thus facilitating the distinction between more and less susceptible areas. © 2022 The Author(s).

Rapid landslide susceptibility assessments are indispensable and critical for risk analysis and emergency management. Previous studies mainly focus on the regional-scale assessment of EQIL susceptibility, while the global analyses of that are lacking. In this study, we constructed a global model for rapidly assessing earthquake-induced landslide susceptibility based on the random forest (RF) algorithm using globally available data. In total, 288,114 landslides from 16 high-quality EQIL inventories were utilized to develop the global landslide model. We split the data into 70% training dataset for model training and 30% testing data for model evaluation. We also used three blind test events to validate the model performance. The model showed excellent performance on the testing data (accuracy = 0.945, and AUC = 0.985). The RF model exhibited strong spatial generalizability and robustness, with an AUC exceeding 0.8 for each landslide inventory and showing good performance on the blind test events. The resulting landslide susceptibility maps also match relatively well with the actual landslide locations. Among the conditioning factors, modified Mercalli intensity (MMI), elevation and slope are the three most important conditioning factors. The susceptibility maps for each landslide event were produced. The developed RF model would be useful in studies of earthquake-induced landslide susceptibility and emergency response after an earthquake.

In this paper, chi-square (CS) and backward elimination (BE), which are well-known feature selection methods, were used for the optimum selection of input features/factors for training artificial neural network (ANN) for landslide susceptibility modeling. Initially, seventeen landslide affecting factors were considered for the ANN model which were reduced to twelve and eleven based on the ANN optimized by CS (CSANN) and BE (BEANN), respectively. Accuracy (ACC), Kappa Index, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve were used to evaluate and validate performance of the models. Results show that both the feature selection methods (CS and BE) improved significantly performance of the hybrid BEANN and CSANN models in comparison to single ANN model. Results indicated that performance of the BEANN model (AUROC 0.963; ACC 91.31) is the best in comparison to CSANN (AUROC 0.950; ACC 89.80) and ANN (AUROC 0.949; ACC 76.40) models in the accurate prediction of landslide susceptible areas/zones. Therefore, it is reasonable to state that the BE is more effective feature selection method than the CS in improving performance of the ANN model and thus, it can be used for better landslide susceptibility analysis for the landslide management of the area.

The proposed method is implemented by using the Bagging scheme to integrate the base-level RSNBtree model. To predict landslide susceptibility for the study area, a spatial database consisted of 807 landslides and 11 conditioning factors has been prepared. Evaluation of conditioning factors was conducted using the Pearson correlation coefficient and Relief-F method. The results indicate that all factors except the topographic wetness index can be accepted as modeling inputs. Particularly, the distance to rivers is the most important factor in landslide susceptibility prediction. The performance of landslide models was evaluated using statistical indices and areas under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). The support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) were adopted for the comparison with our methods. Results show that the BRSNBtree (AUC = 0.968) achieves the highest prediction performance, which successfully refines the RSNBtree (AUC = 0.938) and outperforms the RF (AUC = 0.949) and SVM (AUC = 0.895). Therefore, the proposed BRSNBtree presents advantages in targeting landslide susceptible areas and provides a promising method for landslide susceptibility assessment.

The outcome showed that machine learning method is well suitable for the landslide susceptibility assessment along transmission network over grid cell units, and the accuracy of susceptibility models is evolving rapidly from statistical-based models toward machine learning techniques. However, the multivariate statistical logistic regression methods perform better when computed over heterogeneous slope terrain units, probably because the number of units is significantly reduced.

Three data mining models and their two-mode ensembles were selected as the basis of our experiment, namely, support vector machine (SVM), maximum entropy (MaxEnt), the ensemble of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and the imperialistic competitive algorithm (ANFIS-ICA), and their addition/multiplicity ensemble modes (WAE and WME). Further, we imitated four community groups and the main goals they aspire, namely, a speculative builder or a financial risk analyst (seeking the highest economic opportunities), people or NGOs (seeking the lowest human casualties and economic losses), the government (seeking a trade-off between the two latter goals), and a mechanical engineering supervisor (seeking the most robust and stable model design). Results revealed that, in contrast to some assumptions made by several researchers in different literature, the 70:30% partitioned training/validation samples would not give satisfactory results in our study area but, instead, 60:40% partition seems to be a good trade-off for the modelsâ learning and prediction powers. Moreover, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves suggested that the hybrid of ANFIS-ICA shows excellent results compared with its counterparts. Regarding the model selection stage at the optimal sample balance of 60:40%, it was conceived that although the WME model showed the lowest error type II (false negative) in both training and validation stages, it manifested the highest error type I (false positive) while other models placed somewhere in between. Conversely, the WAE outperformed other models in terms of the lowest error type I. Further, the robustness analysis suggested that SVM and MaxEnt models can provide more stable results compared with their counterparts. Hence, in the process of model selection, perspectives matter the most as there is no one model that performs best for every problem.

Hence, it is imperative to map the areas susceptible to landslides to minimize their risk. Around Abbottabad, a large city in northern Pakistan, a large number of landslides can be found. This study aimed to map the landslide susceptibility over these regions in Pakistan by using three Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Linear Regression (LiR), Logistic Regression (LoR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Several influencing factors were used to identify the potential landslide areas, including elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, general curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, landcover classification system, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil, lithology, fault density, topographic roughness index, and road density. The weights of these factors were calculated using ML techniques. The weightage overlay tool is adopted to map the final output. According to three ML models, lithology, NDWI, slope, and LCCS significantly impact landslide occurrence. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is applied to validate the performance of models, and the results show the AUC value of LiR (88%) is better than SVM (86%) and LoR (85%) models. ML models and final susceptibility map gives good accuracy, which can be reliable for the results. The studyâs outcome provides baselines for policymakers to propose adequate protection and mitigation measures against the landslides in the region, and any other researcher can adopt this methodology to map the landslide susceptibility in another area having similar characteristics.

The present work intends to identify landslide susceptibility along Karakorum Highway (KKH) in Northern Pakistan, using landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). To compare and predict the connection between causative factors and landslides, the random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k nearest neighbor (KNN) and naive Bayes (NB) models were used in this research. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar persistent scatterer interferometry (PS-InSAR) technology was used to explore the displacement movement of retrieved models. Initially, 332 landslide areas alongside the Karakorum Highway were found to generate the landslide inventory map using various data. The landslides were categorized into two sections for validation and training, of 30% and 70%. For susceptibility mapping, thirteen landslide-condition factors were created. The area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve technique was utilized for accuracy comparison, yielding 83.08, 82.15, 80.31, and 72.92% accuracy for RF, XGBoost, KNN, and NB, respectively. The PS-InSAR technique demonstrated a high deformation velocity along the line of sight (LOS) in modelsensitive areas. The PS-InSAR technique was used to evaluate the slope deformation velocity, which can be used to improve the LSM for the research region. The RF technique yielded superior findings, integrating with the PS-InSAR outcomes to provide the region with a new landslide susceptibility map.

Rockfall and debris flows are dangerous geological risks on the main route, and they often disrupt traffic and result in fatalities. As a result, the landslide susceptibility map (LSM) evolution along the highway could make it safer to drive. In this article, remote sensing data are combined with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to develop the LSM. Initially, 274 landslide locations we determined and mapped in ArcGIS software and randomly divided into a ratio of 8/2. Secondly, ten landslide susceptibility factors were developed using satellite imagery and different topographical and geological maps. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value, was used to estimate the model's effectiveness. Our consequences showed that, for three models, the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models, as well as slope, elevation, and distance from the river parameters, had the maximum influence upon landslide sensitivity. Accordingly, the prediction rates are 83.5%, 82.7%, and 80.7% for RF, XGBoost, and KNN. Furthermore, the RF method has better efficiency as compared to other models on the base of AUC.

In this study, three modeling techniques, namely, support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN-1D), and (CNN-2D), were applied and their outcomes were compared for landslide susceptibility mapping at Asir Region, Saudi Arabia. As a first step, a landslide inventory map was developed from various data sources. A total of 181 landslide points were identified and divided into 70% training and 30% validation datasets. Thirteen landslide indicator factors (LIFs) were used, including elevation, aspect, distance to fault, geology, land use, plan and profile curvature, distance to road, slope length (LS), stream power index (SPI), topographic witness index (TWI), slope angle, and distance to streams. Experimental results of model accuracy using receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve (ROC, AUC), mean absolute error (MAE), and kappa index (K) showed that the CNN-1D and CNN-2D models (ROC = 86% and 89%, respectively) were more accurate than conventional machine learning model (SVM) (ROC = 82%) in predicting landslides spatially. Specifically, the results showed that CNN-1D and CNN-2D were 4.9% and 7.9% better than support vector machine (SVM) in terms of ROC, and that CNN-2D was 3.5% better than CNN-1D. Moreover, other statistical indices showed that CNN-2D produce the highest value of kappa index (0.855) and lowest value of mean absolute error (0.072), whereas SVM provides the lowest value of kappa index (0.562) and highest value of mean absolute error (0.223). Results indicate that the CNN-2D model is the optimal model for landslide susceptibility mapping.

In the past, numerous attempts have been made to develop landslide susceptibility maps using various tools. This research work aims to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) by developing a deep multi-layer perceptron network named as DMLP-LSM and to demonstrate it over Srinagar-Rudraprayag region, a landslide prone region recognized by the Geological Survey of India (GSI). Initially, training datasets are generated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) enabled multi-criteria analysis, which involves information from various landslide causative factors. In a first, one dimensional line of sight (1D LOS) velocity, one of the critical inputs and prominent indicator for landslide susceptibility, is generated by processing 60 Sentinel-1A scenes using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) algorithm. The 1D LOS velocity map, generally used for quantitative monitoring slow moving landslides, is used here as a thematic layer. The thematic layers and LSMs were fed to the proposed DMLP-LSM network as input and output, respectively. The developed model reached an accuracy of 91.47% with precision, specificity and ROC_AUC score as 92.11%, 95.55% and 0.9072, respectively. It further identified nearly 15 square km area as susceptible to landslide. The efficacy of the proposed model is compared with two well-known machine learning models for LSM preparation, namely support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). In terms of accuracy, DMLP-LSM and RF had similar performance, but better than SVM. The velocity maps derived from MT-InSAR processing played a prominent role in the generation of LSM, supporting model training and performance. The proposed model achieved highest precision and specificity, and its performance would also improve LSM preparation when using larger datasets. The obtained results are promising, and the trained model can help in the rapid generation of LSMs. Â© 2021 COSPAR",Advances in Space Research,10.1016/j.asr.2021.10.021,4,2,Yes,"DNN,SVM,RF",,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study is to introduce a CNN-based model in LSM and systematically compare its overall performance with the conventional machine learning models of random forest, logistic regression, and support vector ma-chine. Herein, we selected Zhangzha Town in Sichuan Province, China, and Lantau Island in Hong Kong, China, as the study areas. Each landslide inventory and corresponding predisposing factors were stacked to form spatial datasets for LSM. The receiver operating characteristic analysis, area under the curve (AUC), and several statistical metrics, such as accuracy, root mean square error, Kappa coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity, were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Finally, the trained models were calculated, and the landslide susceptibility zones were mapped. Results suggest that both CNN and conventional machine learning-based models have a satisfactory performance. The CNN-based model exhibits an excellent prediction capability and achieves the highest performance but also significantly reduces the salt-of-pepper effect, which indicates its great potential for application to LSM.

Wanzhou section of the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China, frequently suffering numerous landslides, is chosen as an example. The class-weighted algorithm focuses on the class-imbalanced issue of landslide and non-landslide samples, and it can turn the class-imbalanced issue into a cost-sensitive machine learning by setting unequal weights for different classes, which contribute to improving the accuracy of landslide susceptibility evaluation. The landslide inventory database was produced by field investigation and remote sensing images derived from Google Earth. Of the 233 landslides in the inventory, 40% were used for validation, and the remaining 60% were used for training purposes. Twelve environmental parameters (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, distance to river, NDVI, NDWI, rainfall, seismic intensity, land use, TRI, lithology) were treated as inputs of the models to produce a landslide susceptibility map (LSM). The AUC value, Balanced accuracy, and Geometric mean score were utilized to estimate the quality of models. The result shows that the weighted models (weighted logistic regression (WLR), weighted LightGBM (WLightGBM), weighted random forest (WRF) have higher AUC values, Balanced accuracy, and Geometric mean scores than those of unweighted methods, which demonstrates that the weighted models exhibit better than unweighted models, with the WRF model having the best performance.

Taking the Fenxi Coal Mine Area of Shanxi Province in China as the research area, landslide data has been investigated by the Shanxi Geological Environment Monitoring Center; adopting the 5-fold cross-validation method, and through Geostatistics analysis means the datasets of all non-landslides and landslides were divided into 80:20 proportions randomly for training and validating models. A set of 15 condition factors including terrain, geological, hydrological, land cover, and human engineering activity factors (distance to road, distance to mined area, ground collapse density) were selected as the evaluation indices to construct the susceptibility assessment model. Three machine learning algorithms for landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) including C5.0 Decision Tree (C5.0), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been selected and compared through the Areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves (AUC), and several statistical estimates. The study revealed that for these three models the value range of prediction accuracies vary from 83.49 to 99.29% (in the training stage), and 62.26â73.58% (in the validation stage). In the two stages, AUCs are between 0.92 to 0.99 and 0.71 to 0.80 respectively. Using Jenks Natural Breaks algorithm, three LSPs levels are established as very low, low, medium, high, and very high probability of landslide by dividing the indices of the LSP. Compared with RF and SVM, C5.0 is considered better in five categories according to quantities and distribution of the landslides and their area percentage for different LSP zones. Four factors such as distance to road, lithology, profile curvature, and ground collapse density are the most suitable condition factors for LSP. The distance to mine area factor has a medium contribution and plays an obvious role in the occurrence of landslides in all the models.

Several factors can interfere in the performance of the models and their resulting maps (especially sampling). This research evaluated the influence of sampling areas on landslide susceptibility modelling and the capacity for generalization and spatial extrapolation of data. Based on an inventory of landslide scars, distributed in five areas of southern Brazil, non-occurrence samples were defined by means of different buffers (2â40 km) in relation to the landslides in order to test the effect of the spatial distribution of the non-occurrence samples on the modeling results. A total of 16 morphometric attributes of the terrain (extracted from a digital elevation model) were used as input variables of the model. Multilayered network training was carried out using a backpropagation algorithm and accuracy was calculated by means of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). Model accuracy was between 0.739 and 0.931. This variation was explained mainly by the buffer used. The susceptibility map resulting from the model of greater accuracy was obtained with a 40-km buffer in order to collect non-occurrence samples. The great distance between the occurrence and non-occurrence samples facilitates the modelling, since it increases the morphometric differences between the sampling groups. When we used samples from only one of the sample areas, the spatial extrapolation of the susceptibility map to the other areas showed high performance. We conclude that the ANN model for landslides susceptibility mapping can be extrapolated spatially, considering the limits of the geomorphological unit or numerical domain of the data.

The SVR-HHO showed the highest accuracy, with AUROC of 0.895 and lowest MSE of 0.147, and ANFIS-BA showed the least accuracy with an AUROC value of 0.82 and MSE value of 0.218. Based on the results, although four hybrid models with more than 80% accuracy can generate very good results, the SVR is superior to the ANFIS model, whereas the HHO algorithm outperformed the bat algorithm. The map generated in this study can be employed by land use planners in more efficient management.

The common practice in optimising landslide prediction models is to search for optimal/suboptimal hyperparameter values in a number of predetermined hyperparameter configurations based on an objective function, i.e., k-fold cross-validation accuracy. However, the overhead of hyperparameter optimisation can be prohibitive, especially for computationally expensive algorithms. This paper introduces an optimisation approach based on meta-learning for the spatial prediction of landslides. The proposed approach is tested in a dense tropical forested area of Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. Instead of optimising prediction models with a large number of hyperparameter configurations, the proposed approach begins with promising configurations based on several basic and statistical meta-features. The proposed meta-learning approach was tested based on Bayesian optimisation as a hyperparameter tuning algorithm and random forest (RF) as a prediction model. The spatial database was established with a total of 63 historical landslides and 15 conditioning factors. Three RF models were constructed based on (1) default parameters as suggested by the sklearn library, (2) parameters suggested by the Bayesian optimisation (BO), and (3) parameters suggested by the proposed meta-learning approach (BO-ML). Based on five-fold cross-validation accuracy, the Bayesian method achieved the best performance for both the training (0.810) and test (0.802) datasets. The meta-learning approach achieved slightly lower accuracies than the Bayesian method for the training (0.769) and test (0.800) datasets. Similarly, based on F1-score and area under the receiving operating characteristic curves (AUROC), the models with optimised parameters either by the Bayesian or meta-learning methods produced more accurate landslide susceptibility assessment than the model with the default parameters. In the present approach, instead of learning from scratch, the meta-learning would begin with hyperparameter configurations optimal for the most similar previous datasets, which can be considerably helpful and time-saving for landslide modelings.

An initial dataset of 36 variables was compiled to investigate the connection between slope morphology and landslide occurrence. Bagged trees, a machine-learning random-forest classifier, was used to evaluate the geomorphic variables, and 12 were identified as important: standard deviation of plan curvature, standard deviation of elevation, sum of plan curvature, minimum slope, mean plan curvature, range of elevation, sum of roughness, mean curvature, sum of curvature, mean roughness, minimum curvature and standard deviation of curvature. These variables were further evaluated using logistic regression to determine the probability of landslide occurrence and then used to create a landslide-susceptibility map. The performance of the logistic-regression model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve, which was 0.83. Standard deviations from the probability mean were used to set landslide-susceptibility classifications: low (0â0.10), lowâmoderate (0.11â0.27), moderate (0.28â0.44), moderateâhigh (0.45â0.61) and high (0.62â1.0). Logistic-regression results were validated by using a separate landslide inventory for the neighbouring Prestonsburg 7.5-minute quadrangle, and running the same regression function. Results indicate that 74.9% of the landslide deposits were identified as having moderate, moderateâhigh or high landslide susceptibility. Combining inventory mapping with statistical modelling identified important geomorphic variables and produced a useful approach to landslide-susceptibility mapping. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

In LIM, 91 landslides were plotted and classified into training (64 landslides) and testing (27 landslides) subsets randomly to train and validate the models. A total of 21 landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were considered as model inputs, and the results of each model were categorised under five susceptibility classes. The receiver operating characteristics curve and 21 statistical measures were used to evaluate and prioritise the models.

Thus, this study puts forward an approach for drawing up a landslide inventory using textual data from telephone records, and for mapping hazards of landslides in an urban area. Forty thousand seven hundred ninety-two textual records and the naive Bayes algorithm were used to classify them, and these form the landslide inventory. After creating the inventory, the random forest algorithm with 12 conditioning variables was used to map landslide hazards. The text classification model obtained an accuracy of 0.8671 and a Kappa index of 0.8038. The hazard mapping model obtained accuracy of 0.9503 and an AUC (area under the curve)-ROC (receiver operating characteristics) of 0.9870. The results produced by the model were also compared with real landslides reported in news reports and were shown to be close to what had happened, thus demonstrating the ability of the proposed approach to predict landslides. Finally, the proposed approach can be used in simulation environments, thereby supporting strategic decision-making associated with hazard analysis.

The investigation was carried out to ascertain the effectiveness of NaÃ¯ve Bayes Multinomial (NBM) and Random Trees (RT) in landslide susceptibility mapping. The NBM is an advancement of the frequently used NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifiers, while the RT was built to overcome the limitations of the traditional forest classifiers. A geospatial database for this investigation comprises 148 landslide locations influenced by ten (10) landslide conditioning factors. The factors (Slope Angle, Slopes Elevation, Slope Aspect, Plan curvature, Profile Curvature, Lithology, Soil type, Stream power index (SPI), Sediment transport index (STI), and Rainfall precipitation) were drawn using a Multi Collinearity Decision Making (MCDM) technique. A Frequency Ratio (FR) analysis was used to obtain the relative significance of the factors in the slides. Predictive models were also developed by quantifying these models using data mining techniques. A section of the entire geospatial data (70%) was used as training datasets, while the remaining part of the data (30%) was used to validate the trained datasets. SVM, RT, and NBM algorithms were used to produce predicted datasets from the training datasets. These predicted datasets were used to develop the Landslides Susceptibility Models. A comparative assessment between the two classifiers against the famous traditional learning algorithm, the Support vector machines (SVM), was conducted. Model performance evaluators such as the AUROC, RSME, F-measure, MAE, and ACC were employed to check the predictive capabilities and accuracies of the models. The indices indicated that the SVM model performed better than the other two algorithms in both training and validation datasets. Further analysis and comparison of the models reveal that the new data mining techniques are reliable for landslide susceptibility. Simultaneously, the traditional algorithm is also useful and remains relevant, especially with similar site conditions.

The purpose of this research is to establish a coupled landslide warning model based on random forest susceptibility zoning and precipitation. The 1520 landslide events in Fengjie County, Chongqing, China, before 2016 are taken as research cases. We adapt the random forest model to build a landslide susceptibility model. The antecedent effective precipitation model, based on the fractal rela-tionship, is used to calculate the antecedent effective precipitation in the 10 days before the landslide event. Based on different susceptibility zones, the effective precipitation corresponding to different cumulative frequencies is counted as the threshold, and the threshold is adjusted according to the fitted curve. Finally, according to the daily precipitation, the rain warning levels in susceptibility zones are further adjusted, and the final prewarning model of the susceptibility zoning and precipitation coupling is obtained. The results show that the random forest model has good prediction ability for landslide susceptibility zoning, and the precipitation warning model that couples landslide susceptibility, antecedent effective precipitation, and the daily precipitation threshold has high early warning ability. At the same time, it was found that the precipitation warning model coupled with antecedent effective precipitation and the daily precipitation threshold has more accurate precipitation warning ability than the precipitation warning model coupled with the antecedent effective precipitation only; the coupling of the two can complement each other to better characterize the occurrence of landslides triggered by rainfall. The proposed coupled landslide early warning model based on random forest susceptibility and rainfall inducing factors can provide scientific guidance for landslide early warning and prediction, and improve the manageability of landslide risk.

Five accuracy metrics, including overall accuracy (OA), precision, recall, F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and a statistical significance test were employed to measure the effectiveness of the optimization strategies on XGBoost algorithm. Compared to the XGBoost model with default setting, the optimized models provided a significant improvement of up to 13% in terms of overall accuracy, which was also ascertained by McNemarâs test.

The primary objectives of this study are to explore the influence of the traditional buffer-controlled sampling method on model performance and to propose a Newmark-based sampling approach for coseismic landslides. The Jiuzhaigou meizoseismal region of China is selected as the region of study. Six sample datasets are constructed for three machine learning models, namely a deep neural network (DNN), logistic regression (LR), and a support vector machine (SVM). The samples cover two scenarios: scenario-BZ, a set of samples created using different buffer distances, and scenario-LD, a set of non-landslide samples created by the Newmark-based method. Intriguingly, the results indicate that the area under the curve (AUC) is positively correlated with the buffer distance in scenario-BZ (DNN: 0.894â0.979, SVM: 0.894â0.981, LR: 0.797â0.889), but gentle valleys in the buffer zone are assigned over-conservative susceptibility values while the probability of landslides in steep mountains outside the buffer zone is underestimated. In contrast, all models assign more reasonable susceptibility values in scenario-LD (AUC values of 0.969, 0.969, and 0.931 for the DNN, LR, and SVM models, respectively). These results suggest that the landslide susceptibility obtained by the traditional buffer-controlled method may be inaccurate, despite the prediction model achieving excellent performance. The proposed approach can therefore provide insights into coseismic landslide susceptibility in other earthquake regions.

In view of the potential subjectivity and randomness in random sampling, this paper considers LSM as a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning problem and proposes a two-step deep neural network framework (T-DNN). Through the Spy technique and iteratively training binary classifiers, negative samples with high confidence were identified from the random subsamples with unlabeled sets. Based on the framework and traditional random sampling, we used logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN) models for testing and validation. Taking the Changbai Mountain Area in Jilin Province, China, as an example, according to the regional landslide list and the metrological, geographical, and human factors of frequent disasters, landslide susceptibility was evaluated. Results show that the proposed T-DNN method can enhance the selection of negative samples and make the results of landslide susceptibility assessment more reliable and accurate; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) reaches 0.953.

First, depthwise separable convolution (DSC) extracts spatial features to prevent confusion of multi-factor features. Second, spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) extracts response features to obtain features under different scales. Third, the high-level features are fused into prepared ML classifiers for more effective feature classification. This framework effectively extracts and uses different-dimension features of samples, explores ML classifiers for beneficial feature classification, and breaks through the limitation of fixed input sample sizes.

The landslides caused by the 2005 Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These machine learning models are innovative and can assess environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI, Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5%), 0.893 (89.3%), and 0.790 (79.0%), respectively. Based on the three machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895, and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers. Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and infrastructural areas.

The efficient and automatic multi-scale segmentation (MSS) method proposed by the authors promotes the application of slope units. However, LSP modeling based on these slope units has not been performed. Moreover, the heterogeneity of conditioning factors in slope units is neglected, leading to incomplete input variables of LSP modeling. In this study, the slope units extracted by the MSS method are used to construct LSP modeling, and the heterogeneity of conditioning factors is represented by the internal variations of conditioning factors within slope unit using the descriptive statistics features of mean, standard deviation and range. Thus, slope units-based machine learning models considering internal variations of conditioning factors (variant slope-machine learning) are proposed. The Chongyi County is selected as the case study and is divided into 53,055 slope units. Fifteen original slope unit-based conditioning factors are expanded to 38 slope unit-based conditioning factors through considering their internal variations. Random forest (RF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) machine learning models are used to construct variant Slope-RF and Slope-MLP models. Meanwhile, the Slope-RF and Slope-MLP models without considering the internal variations of conditioning factors, and conventional grid units-based machine learning (Grid-RF and MLP) models are built for comparisons through the LSP performance assessments. Results show that the variant Slope-machine learning models have higher LSP performances than Slope-machine learning models; LSP results of variant Slope-machine learning models have stronger directivity and practical application than Grid-machine learning models. It is concluded that slope units extracted by MSS method can be appropriate for LSP modeling, and the heterogeneity of conditioning factors within slope units can more comprehensively reflect the relationships between conditioning factors and landslides.

Ngororero, Rubavu, Nyabihu, and Karongi were the worst-hit areas, as reported by Rwanda Broadcasting Agency (RBA). Such recurring disasters have posed significant challenges to the affected communities, requiring strong measures like susceptibility mapping to address their impact in the future. The literature review indicates that statistic and machine-learning susceptibility mapping efforts have been applied in the study region. However, these studies have not focused explicitly on localized scale studies of the western province; instead, they have mainly concentrated on examining the entire country. Using artificial neural networks (ANN), Shannon entropy (SE), and frequency ratio (FR), this paper aims to fill some gaps in the Rwandan landslide literature by integrating localized studies of the landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) of the western province of Rwanda using the available higher data resolution. The LSM studies took 1157 landslide inventory locations and considered a broader range of landslide-conditioning factors compared to the previous studies on the region (distance from the road, aspect, elevation, slope degree, stream power index, normalized differential vegetation index, plan curvature, distance from the river, topographic wetness index, geology, and rainfall). In model training, 70% (810 points) of the landslide points underwent utilization, while the remaining 30% (347 points) served the purpose of model testing. The obtained area under the curve (AUC) values from model validation and testing provided reliable accuracy measures for the three LSM methods: ANN (AUC = 0.929 and 0.924), FR (AUC = 0.895 and 0.889), and SE (AUC = 0.768 and 0.750). Despite varying data handling, the models show that Rutsiro, Ngororero, and Karongi in Rwanda's Western Province have the highest landslide concentration. The relative importance of conditioning factors indicates that geology, rainfall, distance to the road, slope, and NDVI factors played a crucial role in landslides in the studied area. The slope can be stabilized by enhancing drainage, modifying slope angles, and implementing structural fortifications. It is hoped that the findings of this study will aid Rwandan policymakers and global researchers mitigate landslides and their dynamics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Earth Sciences,10.1007/s12665-023-11134-4,2,2,Yes,"ANN,FR,SE",,"Germany,Nigeria,United States,Saudi Arabia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, information value (IV) and logistic regression (LR) were selected as representatives of the conventional algorithms, categorical boosting (CatBoost), and conventional neural networks (CNN) as the advanced algorithms, for LSM in Yadong County, and their performance was compared.

Secondly, the data set was randomly divided into two parts, 80% of which was used for modeling and 20% for validation. Finally, the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical metrics were applied to validate and compare the performance of the models. The results showed that the CNN model performed the best (sensitivity = 79.38%, specificity = 91.00%, accuracy = 85.28%, and AUC = 0.908), while the LR model performed the worst (sensitivity = 79.38%, specificity = 76.00%, accuracy = 77.66%, and AUC = 0.838) and the CatBoost model performed better (sensitivity = 76.28%, specificity = 85.00%, accuracy = 80.81%, and AUC = 0.893).

Considering the difference in topography and neglected landslide events, particularly in transboundary areas of the Himalayas, it is necessary to precisely model the susceptibility in relation to spatial heterogeneity. In this study, we have used multisource remote sensing data, open-source geographical data, and multisource landslide event inventories for the past 20 years (2000−2020). In addition, machine learning methods were implemented to establish a landslide susceptibility model with internal landslide drivers within the transboundary areas. Considering the spatial heterogeneity, the landslide susceptibility of the northern and southern slope in the transboundary areas of the Himalayas was determined using Google Earth Engine (GEE), an online cloud platform. Furthermore, we generated a thematic map of landslide susceptibility at a spatial resolution of 500 m, considering the contribution rate of each landslide internal driver of the landslide. Finally, we analyzed the landslide drivers in areas with high landslide susceptibility and low landslide event point density. The main results are as follows: (i) elevation, aspect, and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) are top three internal drivers of susceptibility on the northern and southern slopes. Meanwhile, the northern slope is dominated by geological, seismic, and soil structure parameters while the southern slope is dominated by terrain, geomorphological, and land cover parameters; (ii) elevation, aspect, and FVC of 3400–4100 m, 260°–335°, and 8 %–30 %, respectively, are related to high landslide susceptibility on the northern slope, while elevation, aspect, and FVC of 980–2100 m, 170°–230°, 70 %–98 %, respectively, are related to high landslide susceptibility on the southern slope, which presents more extreme landslide-susceptible areas compared with the northern slope; and (iii) areas with high landslide susceptibility and low landslide event density are universal. These insights demonstrate that modeling and analyzing the heterogeneity of landslide susceptibility of the northern and southern slopes in transboundary areas of the Himalayas are required to provide a reference for locating and preventing landslide disasters, increase to the focus on landslide-susceptible areas, improve the data gap between landslide inventories and actual landslide events, and reduce the impact of missing data in landslide inventories for this region. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Geomorphology,10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108723,2,2,Yes,RF,,"China,Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Followed by this empirical evidence, we explored the XgBoost classifier by incorporating TreeSHAP, a game-theory-based statistical algorithm used to explain Machine Learning models, to identify eloquent features such as SLOPE, ELEVATION, TWI that complement the performance of the XGBoost classifier mostly and features such as LANDUSE, NDVI, SPI which has less effect on models performance. According to the TreeSHAP explanation of features, we selected the nine most significant landslide causal factors out of 15. Evidently, an optimized version of XgBoost along with feature reduction by 40% has outperformed all other classifiers in terms of popular evaluation metrics with a Cross-validation Weighted F1 score of 95.01% on the training and AUC score of 97%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",SN Computer Science,10.1007/s42979-023-01960-5,2,2,Yes,"XGB,LOGR,KNN,SVM,AB",,Bangladesh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Himalayan terrains are highly susceptible to different natural hazards as well as disasters particularly land failure activities mainly due to inherent tectonic activities which further enhanced by various Neo-tectonic and Neolithic activities. This scientific study provides an enhanced framework for the assessment of proper and precise landslide susceptibility in the two districts of Arunachal Pradesh (Tawang and West Kameng) considering both physical and anthropogenic factors and various machine learning models (SVM, AdaBoost and XGBoost). At first, landslide inventory maps were developed based on previous landslide events. Here, 70% of the data were randomly selected for training and remaining was used for validation and optimization of the models using statistical implications and validation assessment methods. The result showed that the high and very high landslide susceptible areas are mainly concentrated in the middle portion along the Bhalukpong-Bomdia road section. Based on the AUC value and other statistical indicators it has been observed that AdaBoost is the most efficient model here (AUC = 0.92). AUC values of SVM and XGBoost are 0.85 and 0.89 respectively. AdaBoost model identifies that very low susceptibility class occupies 60.22% area and very high landslide susceptibility class occupies 15.51% area and it will be considered as more encouraging method for landslide susceptibility determination in this kind of cases for better accurateness. This high accuracy susceptibility map positively helps during the execution of various developmental projects. © 2022 The Author(s)",Geosystems and Geoenvironment,10.1016/j.geogeo.2022.100158,2,2,Yes,"SVM,AB,XGB",,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reduce the destruction in these endangered regions, the prediction of landslide incidents with good accuracy remains a key challenge. Over the years, machine learning models have been used to increase the accuracy and precision of landslide predictions. These machine learning models are sensitive to the data on which they are applied. Feature selection is a crucial task in applying machine learning as meticulously selected features can significantly improve the performance of the machine learning model. These selected features decrease the learning time of the model and increase comprehensibility. In this paper, we have considered three feature selection methods namely chi-squared, extra tree classifier and heat map. The paper substantiates that feature selection can significantly increase the performance of the model. The study was carried out on the landslide data of the Kullu to Rohtang Pass transport corridor in Himachal Pradesh, India. The classification score and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the model performance. Results exhibited that eliminating one or more features using different feature selection methods increased the comprehensibility of the model by reducing the dimensionality of the dataset. The model achieved an accuracy of 90.74% and an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) value of 0.979.

Three distinct machine learning (ML) models, namely the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Maximum Entropy (ME), and Random Forest (RF), were employed to identify the key contributing factors to landslide occurrences in the study region. The dataset used in this study consisted of landslide conditioning factors and a landslide inventory map. The conditioning factors encompassed lithology, soil type, plane curvature, profile curvature, elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, land use/land cover (LULC), distance to fault, river, road, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI), and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The landslide inventory map contained 177 landslide locations and 65 non-landslide points obtained from Google Earth. Each machine learning (ML) model was trained and implemented independently using 70% of the training data, with the results validated against the remaining 30% of the landslide inventory dataset. Ensemble results from GLM, ME, and RF were obtained using the median approach. All three models exhibited consistent performance and identified similar landslide-prone areas. Among the various factors studied, proximity to rivers emerged as the most influential factor contributing to landslides, followed by the distance to roads and slope gradient. The study revealed that the districts of Argo and Yaftali Sufla, near Faizabad, were identified as particularly susceptible to landslides, especially in the vicinity of large valleys. Out of the total study area of 3086.4 km2, ∼2162 km2 were deemed relatively safe from landslides, while 149 km2 (representing 4.8% of the study region) were identified as highly susceptible to landslides. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) statistics were used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning (ML) algorithms. The RF and ME models demonstrated the highest performance levels.

This study proposes an improved spatial case-based reasoning (SCBR) considering multiple spatial drivers to overcome above problems and uses landslide susceptibility mapping as an example. Specifically, these spatial drivers were captured, extracted, and integrated into case representation by using geographic self-organizing mapping algorithm, spatial statistic, and spatial adjacent matrix, respectively. Additionally, the K-nearest neighbor method as case retrieval was introduced to retrieve the K similar cases based on the local and global similarity reasoning. Finally, the Gaussian process regression as case reuse method was generated to landslide susceptibility index under the assumption that K similar cases follows Gaussian distribution. Our experimental results show that the precision, F1, recall, and kappa of the proposed SCBR method are 0.974, 0.976, 0.979, and 0.953 which are higher than those of the traditional case-based reasoning (0.931, 0.941, 0.953, and 0.881), long short-term memory (0.951, 0.933, 0.915, and 0.870), and extreme gradient boosting decision tree (0.963, 0.967, 0.972, and 0.945), respectively.

It is necessary to update these maps continuously because of the complexity of landslide events. This fact requires further extending the approach techniques with practical implications. Therefore, this study aimed to develop landslide susceptibility prediction maps based on advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. Five state-of-the-art hybrid ML models were developed: bagging MLP, dagging MLP, decorate MLP, rotation forest MLP, and random subspace MLP with multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a base classifier. Sixteen causative factors were collected to build landslide susceptibility maps based on the relationship between historical landslide locations and specific local geo-environmental conditions. The model performance was verified using various statistical indexes. Based on the area under ROC curve (AUC) analysis results of the testing dataset, the rotation forest MLP model has the greatest predictive accuracy of AUC = 0.818. It is followed by the decorate MLP and bagging MLP (AUC = 0.804), the random subspace MLP model (AUC = 0.796), the dagging MLP (AUC = 0.789), and the single MLP (AUC = 0.698).

This study compared the prediction performances of logistic regression (LR), 5-CV SVM, GA SVM, and PSO SVM on landslide susceptibility mapping, to explore the spatial distribution of landslide susceptibility in the study area in Tibetan Plateau, China. A geospatial database was established based on 392 historical landslides and 392 non-landslides in the study area. We used 11 influencing factors of altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to road, distance to river, distance to fault, peak ground acceleration (PGA), and rainfall to construct an influencing factor evaluation system. To evaluate the models, four susceptibility maps were compared via receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the results showed that prediction rates for the models are 84% (LR), 87% (5-CV SVM), 85% (GA SVM), and 90% (PSO SVM).

Then, a single machine learning model can easily become overfitting, thus reducing the accuracy and robustness of the evaluation model. This paper proposes a combined machine-learning model to address the issues. The landslide susceptibility in mountain roads were mapped by using factor analysis to normalize and reduce the dimensionality of the initial condition factor and generating six new combination factors as evaluation indexes. The mountain roads in the Youxi County, Fujian Province, China were used for the landslide susceptibility mapping. Three most frequently used machine learning techniques, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) models, were used to model the landslide susceptibility of the study area and validate the accuracy of this evaluation index system. The global minimum variance portfolio was utilized to construct a machine learning combined model. 5-fold cross-validation, statistical indexes, and AUC (Area Under Curve) values were implemented to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the landslide susceptibility model. The mean AUC values for the SVM, RF, and ANN models in the training stage were 89.2%, 88.5%, and 87.9%, respectively, and 78.0%, 73.7%, and 76.7%, respectively, in the validating stage.

We designed two steps: first, a random selection, a SOM network, a one class SVM model, and a SOM-OCSVM model were used to generate non-landslide sample datasets. Second, four machine learning models (MLs)—namely logistic regression (LRG), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)—were used to verify the effects of four non-landslide sample datasets on LSM. From the region along the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, we selected 11 conditioning factors and 1186 investigated landslides to perform the aforementioned experiments. The results show that the SOM-OCSVM method achieves the highest AUC (>0.94) and minimum standard deviation (<0.081) compared with other methods. Moreover, RF achieves the best performance in different datasets compared with other ML models.

To create a comprehensive inventory of landslide occurrences, high-resolution satellite imagery, topographic maps, historical records, and GPS data gathered through fieldwork were employed. In total, 402 known landslide sites were used for modeling and validating the landslide occurrences in the study area. Sixteen factors were integrated: topography, hydrology, soil type, geology, and ecology. The training dataset comprised 72% of all landslide locations, while the remaining 28% was used to validate the generated landslide occurrences. The different models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The analysis of both the training and validation datasets was used to determine the model’s accuracy. To improve the performance of the multilayer perceptron neural network architecture, the HS, ERWCA, SFLA, and WOA algorithms were applied to improve its efficiency. The accuracy of the applied prediction models was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) measure before creating landslide vulnerability charts in a GIS framework. The results showed that the HS-MLP had the greatest estimated AUCs for population sizes in training databases equal to 50, with values of 0.9921 and 0.9828 for training databases and testing databases, respectively. Similar to this, in the training and testing databases, the AUC values for the ER_WCAMLP with a 200-swarm swarm size were determined to be 0.9998 and 0.9821, respectively. For population sizes of 150 and 500, respectively, the training and testing AUCs for the SFLA-MLP were determined to be 0.984 and 0.9821, and 0.9867 and 0.9873, respectively, for the WOA-MLP. The best solution was found after 50, 200, 150, and 500 iterations for the models that used the population in the best fit HS, ER_WCA, SFLA, and WOA algorithms, respectively. In light of these findings, managers and planners can benefit from this research's findings in pre-crisis management as it demonstrates how optimization algorithms have improved the neural network’s accuracy and performance in the evaluation and detection of problematic areas. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Environment, Development and Sustainability",10.1007/s10668-023-04117-9,2,2,Yes,ANN,,"China,United States,Iran,Viet Nam",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the time-consuming compilation of landslide inventories as a prerequisite for landslide susceptibility mapping, model transferability can be key to making hazard-related information available to stakeholders in a timely manner. In this paper, we compare and combine two important transfer-learning strategies for landslide susceptibility modeling: case-based reasoning (CBR) and domain adaptation (DA). Care-based reasoning gathers knowledge from previous similar situations (source areas) and applies it to solve a new problem (target area). Domain adaptation, which is widely used in computer vision, selects data from a source area that has a similar distribution to the target area. We assess the performances of single- and multiple-source CBR, DA, and CBR-DA strategies to train and combine landslide susceptibility models using generalized additive models (GAMs) for 10 study areas with various resolutions (1, 10, and 25 m) located in Austria, Ecuador, and Italy. The performance evaluation shows that CBR and combined CBR-DA based on our proposed similarity criterion were able to achieve performances comparable to benchmark models trained in the target area itself. Particularly the CBR strategies yielded favorable results in both single- and multi-source strategies. Although DA tended to have overall lower performances than CBR, it had promising results in scenarios where the source-target similarity was low. We recommend that future transfer-learning research for landslide susceptibility modeling can build on the similarity criterion we used, as it successfully helped to transfer landslide susceptibility models by identifying suitable source regions for model training. © 2022 Zhihao Wang et al.",Geoscientific Model Development,10.5194/gmd-15-8765-2022,4,2,Yes,GAM,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Landslide susceptibility evaluation (LSE) is a vital and effective technique for the prevention and control of disastrous landslides. Moreover, about 80% of disastrous landslides had not been discovered ahead and significantly impeded social and economic sustainability development. However, the present studies on LSE mainly focus on the known landslides, neglect the great threat posed by the potential landslides, and thus to some degree constrain the precision and rationality of LSE maps. Moreover, at present, potential landslides are generally identified by the characteristics of surface deformation, terrain, and/or geomorphology. The essential disaster-inducing mechanism is neglected, which has caused relatively low accuracies and relatively high false alarms. Therefore, this work suggests new synthetic criteria of potential landslide identification. The criteria involve surface deformation, disaster-controlling features, and disaster-triggering characteristics and improve the recognition accuracy and lower the false alarm. Furthermore, this work combines the known landslides and discovered potential landslides to improve the precision and rationality of LSE. This work selects Chaya County, a representative region significantly threatened by landslides, as the study area and employs multisource data (geological, topographical, geographical, hydrological, meteorological, seismic, and remote sensing data) to identify potential landslides and realize LSE based on the time-series InSAR technique and XGBoost algorithm.

Based on AUC and Accuracy, GL-ResNet (0.96 and 0.909) outperformed logistic regression (0.92 and 0.851), support vector machines (0.94 and 0.884), deep belief networks (0.95 and 0.884), gated recurrent unit (0.94 and 0.884) and ResNet (0.95 and 0.894). We also explored the robustness of GL-ResNet for LSM. The results suggested that although GL-ResNet is sensitive to initial training conditions, it showed good robustness to model training method and sample ratios. In detail, GL-ResNet outperformed the conventional models in terms of fitting power and prediction performance by 0.03-0.04 and 0.02 respectively in most cases, with even greater differences in the limited training dataset. © 2023 The Author(s).

Recently, deep learning theories and methods have been investigated in landslide modeling. However, their generalization is hindered because of the limited size of landslide data. In the present study, a novel deep learning-based landslide susceptibility assessment method named deep random neural network (DRNN) is proposed. In DRNN, a random mechanism is constructed to drop network layers and nodes randomly during landslide modeling. We take the Lushui area (Southwest China) as the case and select 12 landslide conditioning factors to perform landslide modeling. The performance evaluation results show that our method achieves desirable generalization performance (Kappa = 0.829) and outperforms other network models such as the convolution neural network (Kappa = 0.767), deep feedforward neural network (Kappa = 0.731), and Adaboost-based artificial neural network (Kappa = 0.732). Moreover, the robustness test shows the advantage of our DRNN, which is insensitive to variations in training data size. Our method yields an accuracy higher than 85% when the training data size stands at only 10%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed landslide modeling method in enhancing generalization. The proposed DRNN produces accurate results in terms of delineating landslide-prone areas and shows promising applications. © 2022 by the authors.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland),10.3390/app122412887,4,2,Yes,DNN,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the rapid development of deep-learning techniques, state-of-The-Art semantic segmentation methods based on fully convolutional network (FCNN) have achieved outstanding performance in the landslide detection task. However, most of the existing articles only utilize visual features. Even if the advanced FCNN models are applied, there is still a certain amount of falsely detected and miss detected landslides. In this article, we innovatively introduce landslide susceptibility as prior knowledge and propose an innovative susceptibility-guided landslide detection method based on FCNN (SG-FCNN) to detect landslides from single temporal images. In addition, an unsupervised change detection method based on the mean changing magnitude of objects (MCMO) is further proposed and integrated with the SG-FCNN to detect newly occurred landslides from bitemporal images. The effectiveness of the proposed SG-FCNN and MCMO has been tested in Lantau Island, Hong Kong. The experimental results show that the SG-FCNN can significantly reduce the amount of falsely detected and miss detected landslides compared with the FCNN. It can conclude that applying landslide susceptibility as prior knowledge is much more effective than using visual features only, which introduces a new methodology of landslide detection and lifts the detection performance to a new level. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,10.1109/jstars.2022.3233043,2,2,Yes,CNN,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the appropriate creation of risk maps is critical for mitigating shallow landslide disasters. The first task to be done was to evaluate the vulnerability of shallow landslides based on a machine learning model (random forest (RF), a support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (Log)), and a physical model (SINMAP) in the loess tableland area. By comparing the differences, the best method for evaluating the vulnerability of shallow landslide was selected. The nonlinear response relationship between shallow landslides and environmental factors was quantified based on the frequency ratio. Multicollinearity analysis was used to identify 10 factors that were applied on ML to construct the spatial distribution model. The SINMAP model used a DEM and soil physical parameters to determine the stability coefficient of the study area. The results showed that (1) shallow landslides in Dongzhiyuan mainly occurred on shady slopes with an elevation of 1068–1249 m, a slope gradient of 36°–60° and a concave shape. The stream power and stream transport indexes increased with increasing rainfall erosion, making shallow landslides likely. The susceptibility of shallow landslides changed parabolically with the change in the NDVI and mainly occurred in grassland and shrubland. (2) The four methods performed similarly in predicting the sensitivity of shallow landslides. The high-incidence areas were on both sides of eroded gully slopes. The tableland and gully bottom areas were not prone to shallow landslides.

Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) is a crucial tool for landslide prevention. This paper’s primary objective is to compare the performances of conventional shallow machine learning methods and deep learning methods in LSA based on imbalanced data to evaluate the applicability of the two types of LSA models when class-weighted strategies are applied. In this article, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), deep fully connected neural network (DFCNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were employed for modeling in the Zigui-Badong area of the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. Eighteen landslide influence factors were introduced to compare the performance of four models under a class balanced strategy versus a class imbalanced strategy. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) was applied for factor correlation analysis. The results reveal that the elevation and distance to rivers play a dominant role in LSA tasks. It was observed that DFCNN (AUC = 0.87, F1-score = 0.60) and LSTM (AUC = 0.89, F1-score = 0.61) significantly outperformed LR (AUC = 0.89, F1-score = 0.50) and RF (AUC = 0.88, F1-score = 0.50) under the class imbalanced strategy. The RF model achieved comparable outcomes (AUC = 0.90, F1-score = 0.61) to deep learning models under the class balanced strategy and ran at a faster training speed (up to 63 times faster than deep learning models). The LR model performance was inferior to that of the other three models under the balanced strategy. Meanwhile, the deep learning models and the shallow machine learning models showed significant differences in susceptibility spatial patterns. This paper’s findings will aid researchers in selecting appropriate LSA models.

Therefore, it is crucial to have reliable prediction models for landslide susceptibility in order to identify high-risk areas and implement proactive measures to prevent or mitigate their impacts. The purpose of this study is to propose and evaluate a novel approach called BCMO-DeepNeuralNets for spatial prediction of the areas most susceptible to landslides. The study focuses on a tropical cyclone area in three districts of central Vietnam, namely Nam Tra My, Bac Tra My, and Phuoc Son. Accordingly, ten input factors were considered: slope, aspect, elevation, relief amplitude, land use, soil type, road distance, geology, fault distance, and rainfall. The proposed BCMO-DeepNeuralNets method leverages the power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to develop a deep-learning model capable of inferring landslide susceptibility indices. To optimize this model, the study employs the Balancing Composite Motions Optimization (BCMO) technique. Additionally, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used as benchmark models to confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach. To evaluate the prediction performance of the models, popular metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), accuracy (Acc), and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are employed. The results show that the BCMO-DeepNeuralNets model exhibits high prediction performance, with an MSE of 0.038, Acc of 93.4%, and AUC of 0.971. This model outperforms the benchmark models, LR and SVM. Consequently, BCMO-DeepNeuralNets emerges as a new tool with significant potential for landslide susceptibility mapping.

Landslide databases at times lack information on the underlying triggering mechanism, making these inventories almost unusable in hazard models. We developed a Python-based unique library, Landsifier, that contains three different machine-Learning frameworks for assessing the likely triggering mechanisms of individual landslides or entire inventories based on landslide geometry. Two of these methods only use the 2D landslide planforms, and the third utilizes the 3D shape of landslides relying on an underlying digital elevation model (DEM). The base method extracts geometric properties of landslide polygons as a feature space for the shallow learner - random forest (RF). An alternative method relies on landslide planform images as an input for the deep learning algorithm - convolutional neural network (CNN). The last framework extracts topological properties of 3D landslides through topological data analysis (TDA) and then feeds these properties as a feature space to the random forest classifier. We tested all three interchangeable methods on several inventories with known triggers spread over the Japanese archipelago. To demonstrate the effectiveness of developed methods, we used two testing configurations. The first configuration merges all the available data for the k-fold cross-validation, whereas the second configuration excludes one inventory during the training phase to use as the sole testing inventory. Our geometric-feature-based method performs satisfactorily, with classification accuracies varying between 67ĝ€¯% and 92ĝ€¯%. We have introduced a more straightforward but data-intensive CNN alternative, as it inputs only landslide images without manual feature selection. CNN eases the scripting process without losing classification accuracy. Using topological features from 3D landslides (extracted through TDA) in the RF classifier improves classification accuracy by 12ĝ€¯% on average. TDA also requires less training data. However, the landscape autocorrelation could easily bias TDA-based classification. Finally, we implemented the three methods on an inventory without any triggering information to showcase a real-world application. © Copyright:",Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences,10.5194/nhess-22-3751-2022,3,2,Yes,"RF,CNN",,"Germany,United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conditioning factors consist of slope, elevation, aspect, NDVI, geological type, soil type, distance from the fault, distance from the river, river density, TWI, land cover, and annual rainfall. This research performs seven models over three ratios between the training and testing dataset encompassing 50:50, 60:40, and 70:30 for KNN and NB algorithms and 70:30 for the RF algorithm. This research measures the performance of each model using eight parameters (ROC, AUC, ACC, SN, SP, BA, GM, CK, and MCC). The results indicate that RF 70:30 generates the best performance, witnessed by the evaluation parameters ACC (0.884), SN (0.765), GM (0.863), BA (0.857), CK (0.749), MCC (0.876), and AUC (0.943). Overall, seven models have reasonably good accuracy, ranging between 0.806 and 0.884. Furthermore, based on the best model, the study area is dominated by high susceptibility with an area coverage of 51%, which occurs in the areas with high slopes.

Accordingly, the construction of forest roads through forests should be carefully planned, especially in protection forests. Forest areas in Turkey are generally widespread in mountainous and high sloping areas that are susceptible to landslides-landslide susceptibility is one of the most important criteria for the selection of protected forests. As such, it is important to evaluate detailed and applicable alternatives regarding special areas and private forests. The aim of this study is to determine alternative routes for forest roads in protected forests through the use of geographic information systems (GIS), particularly in areas with high landslide susceptibility. To this end, a landslide susceptibility map (LSM) was created using logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) modeling methods, which are widely used in machine learning (ML). Two models with the highest receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) values were selected, and ten factors (slope, elevation, lithology, distance to road, distance to fault, distance to river, curvature, stream power index, topographic position index, and topographic wetness index) were used. The best LSM modeling method was AUC. The AUC value was 90.6% with the RF approach and 80.3% with the LR approach. The generated LSMs were used to determine alternative routes that were calculated through cost path analysis. It is hoped that the susceptibility to landslides and selection of alternative forest road routes determined through the approaches and techniques in this study will benefit forest road planning as well as plan and decision makers. © 2022 Hrvatsko Sumarsko Drustvo.

Then, their performances were assessed and compared using statistical metrics and the receiver operating curve (ROC). The outcomes indicated that similarity measures influenced the accuracy and the predictive power of these clustering models. In particular, when using a link-based similarity measure, the ROCK performed better with overall performance accuracy of 0.8933 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.875.

The InSAR-derived displacement fields and other in situ geological and topographical factors were integrated, and their correlations with the landslide susceptibility were analyzed. Moreover, multiple machine learning approaches were applied with a goal to construct an optimal model between these complicated factors and landslide susceptibility. Two case studies were performed in the mountainous areas of Taiwan Island and the model performance was evaluated by a confusion matrix. The numerical results revealed that among different machine learning approaches, the Random Forest model out-performed others, with an average accuracy higher than 80%.

At the same time, traditional statistical (TS) models are also considered to produce LSMs in this comparative research. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and recall metric are applied to evaluate the modelâs performance. Based on the evaluation criteria, the ML model outperforms the TS models and the ML models trained using the datasets with larger sample size give a better performance. ML models, especially SVM models, have better performance when training with balanced datasets as well as the datasets of more landslide sample data. Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test are applied to test the significance. The results indicate that sample size and sample ratio are essential factors when considering ML models to produce LSMs. The LSMs produced in this research can provide valid and useful information to the local authorities for landslide mitigation and prediction.

Nevertheless, there are only landslide and unlabeled areas in the real world, and directly considering unlabeled areas as nonlandslide areas may cause bias and incorrect label assignment. In this article, we present a positive unlabeled learning method coupled with adaptive sampling and random forest (AdaPU-RF) to predict landslide susceptibility in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. This method can make full use of the landslide and nonlandslide information contained in unlabeled areas. Experimental results show that the AdaPU-RF method achieves desirable predication outcomes in terms of accuracy analysis, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty analysis. Overall, the application of AdaPU-RF provides a new perspective for landslide susceptibility prediction, and can be recommended for other areas with similar geo-environmental conditions.

To prevent this disastrous problem, researchers have used several approaches for landslide susceptibility modeling, for the purpose of preparing accurate maps marking landslide prone areas. Among the most frequently used approaches for landslide susceptibility mapping is the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method. However, the effectiveness of ANN methods could be enhanced by using hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, which are scarcely applied in landslide mapping. In the current study, nine hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, genetic algorithm (GA)-ANN, evolutionary strategy (ES)-ANN, ant colony optimization (ACO)-ANN, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ANN, biogeography based optimization (BBO)-ANN, gravitational search algorithm (GHA)-ANN, particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA)-ANN, grey wolves optimization (GWO)-ANN, and probability based incremental learning (PBIL)-ANN have been used to spatially predict landslide susceptibility in Algiersâ Sahel, Algeria. The modeling phase was done using a database of 78 landslides collected utilizing Google Earth images, field surveys, and six conditioning factors (lithology, elevation, slope, land cover, distance to stream, and distance to road). Initially, a gamma test was used to decrease the input variable numbers. Furthermore, the optimal inputs have been modeled by the mean of hybrid metaheuristic ANN techniques and their performance was assessed through seven statistical indicators. The comparative study proves the effectiveness of the co-evolutionary PSOGSA-ANN model, which yielded higher performance in predicting landslide susceptibility compared to the other models. Sensitivity analysis using the step-by-step technique was done afterward, which revealed that the distance to the stream is the most influential factor on landslide susceptibility, followed by the slope factor which ranked second. Lithology and the distance to road have demonstrated a moderate effect on landslide susceptibility. Based on these findings, an accurate map has been designed to help land-use managers and decision-makers to mitigate landslide hazards.

As a classical supervised non-parametric machine learning model, support vector machine (SVM) has been widely used in landslide susceptibility prediction in recent years. However, most studies focus on the application of general SVM methods, or compare SVMs as benchmark methods. SVMs with different kernel functions are rarely used in this field. In this study, we apply the general SVM and its popular variants (i.e., multiple kernel learning, infinite ensemble SVM and semi-supervised SVM) to predict landslide susceptibility, and compare their prediction performance. The experimental results show that the Laplacian-SVM has the highest prediction performance (AUC = 0.8815) among SVM-based methods. SVMs with RBF kernel can achieve higher performance than SVMs with linear kernel, indicating that RBF kernel is more suitable for solving susceptibility prediction problems. Furthermore, SVM-based methods have higher sensitivity (0.8543â0.9288) than deep learning methods (0.8237â0.8271), which proves the advantage of SVMs in finding potential landslide areas.

However, this study for landslide susceptibility assessment compares the performance of various techniques and provides additional insights into the factors used by adopting multicollinearity analysis. Landslide-inducing factors considered in this research are lithology, slope, flow direction, fault lines, aspect, elevation, curvature, earthquakes, plan curvature, precipitation, profile curvature, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), roads, and waterways. Results show that SVM performs better than LGR and LR among ML models. On the other hand, the performance of AHP was better than TOPSIS.

In this study, we aimed to assess landslide susceptibility using Wenchuan, southwest China, as a case. For this purpose, we constructed an optimization method that combines a convolutional neural network with the machine learning algorithm of support vector machines, quadratic discriminant analysis, Bayesian optimized gradient boosting tree, and Bayesian optimized random forest. The model inputs were 13,886 historical seismic-induced landslide events interpreted from remote sensing imagery and ten evaluation features: elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to roads, distance to rivers, distance to faults, land use pattern, and soil texture. The output was the probability of landslide occurrence for each prediction unit. Finally, we evaluated the assessed outcomes using both the receiver operating characteristic curve and 1074 latest recorded landslide dataset (2013â2020). The calculations showed that the overall susceptibility values to landslides in the highâvery high interval produced by the hybrid convolutional neural networks was 9.95%â16.91%, which is close to the actual landslide susceptibility of the region. The receiver operating characteristic curve and statistical analysis of the latest landslide event outcomes demonstrated that the hybrid Bayesian optimized gradient boosting tree model had a higher classification accuracy than the other classifiers presented in this study.

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) plays a crucial role in the evaluation and extenuation of risk. To date, a large number of machine learning approaches have been applied to LSM. Of late, a high-level convolutional neural network (CNN) has been applied with the intention of raising the forecast precision of LSM. The primary contribution of the research was to present a model which was based on the CNN for LSM and methodically compare its capability with the traditional machine learning approaches, namely, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF). Subsequently, we used this model in the Wenchuan region, where a catastrophic earthquake happened on 12 May 2008 in China. There were 405 valuable landslides in the landslide inventory, which were divided into a training set (283 landslides) and validation set (122 landslides). Furthermore, 11 landslide causative factors were selected as the modelâs input, and each modelâs output was reclassified into five intervals according to the sensitivity. We also evaluated the modelâs performance by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and several statistical metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and other measures. The results indicated that the CNN-based methods achieved the best performance, with the success-rate curve (SRC) and prediction-rate curve (PRC) approaches reaching 93.14% and 91.81%, respectively. The current research indicated that the approach based on the CNN for LSM had both outstanding goodness-of-fit and excellent prediction capability.

Initially, a geospatial database was generated based on 587 landslide hazards determined by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Stacking technology and field geological hazard surveys; thus, 18 landslide-influencing factors were selected. Subsequently, the landslides were randomly divided into training (70%) and validation data (30%) for model training and testing.

On 17 December 2017, a catastrophic flood of 7 Ã 106 m3 almost destroyed Villa Santa LucÃ­a and approximately 3 km of the southern highway (Route 7), the only land route in Chilean Patagonia that connects this vast region from north to south, exposing the vulnerability of the population and critical infrastructure to these natural hazards. The 2017 flood produced a paradigm shift on the analysis scale to understand the danger to which communities and their infrastructure are exposed. Thus, in this study, we sought to evaluate the susceptibility of landslides in the Yelcho and Rio Frio basins, whose intersection represents the origin of this great flood. For this, we used two approaches, (1) geospatial data in combination with machine learning methods using different training configurations and (2) a qualitative analysis of the landscape considering the geological and geomorphological conditions through fieldwork. For statistical modeling, we used an inventory of landslides that occurred between 2008 and 2017 and a total of 17 predictive variables, which are geoenvironmental, climatological and environmental triggers derived from volcanic and seismic activity. Our results indicate that soil moisture significantly impacted spatial susceptibility, followed by lithology, drainage density and seismic activity. Additionally, we observed that the inclusion of climatic predictors and environmental triggers increased the average performance score of the models by up to 3-5%. Based on our results, we believe that the wide distribution of volcanic-sedimentary rocks hydrothermally altered with zeolites in the western mountains of the Yelcho and Rio Frio basin are highly susceptible to generating large-scale landslides. Therefore, the town of Villa Santa Lucia and the âCarretera Australâ (Route 7) are susceptible to new landslides coming mainly from the western slope. This requires the timely implementation of measures to mitigate the impact on the population and critical infrastructure. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Past landslide locations are used for model training and testing with data of eleven controlling factors in MLAs, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) classifiers. Among the three MLAs, average accuracy of RF model is found between 89 and 90.5%, for SVM the range is between 88 and 90% and for NB the range is between 86 and 87%. The results show that the traditional GIS based weighted overlay technique overestimated vulnerable areas with most of the study area falling in moderate to high susceptible zones. The machine learning models performed much better than the traditional technique as only areas that were identified as most susceptible were locations where landslides had occurred in the past. Within the three ML techniques, RF modelâs performance is marginally better than that of the SVM model, but RF and SVM performed significantly better compared to the NB model. The resultant susceptibility maps highlight the areas where safety measures should be taken before installing mega infrastructure projects.

To exploit the complementary information of different modalities and boost LSM accuracy, this study presents a new LSM model that integrates data modality and machine learning methods. The presented method first groups causative factors into different modal types based on their intrinsic characteristics, followed by the calculation of the pairwise similarity of modal data. The similarities of different modalities are fused using nonlinear graph fusion to generate a unified graph, which is subsequently classified using different machine learning methods to produce final LSM. Experimental results suggest that the presented method achieves higher performance than existing LSM methods.

A proper ratio of the P/N samples will significantly improve the performance of machine learning-based LSA, but an improper ratio can cause inadequate training or data pollution. Conventionally, the determination of the P/N sample ratio is based on experience or by trials and errors, which has substantial uncertainties. This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization method to optimize the P/N sample ratio for machine learning models. Firstly, Anhua County in Hunan province of China is selected as the study area because of numerous landslide disasters that occurred in recent years. Secondly, three representative machine learning models of the support vector machine (SVM), the random forest (RF) and the gradient boost decision tree (GBDT) are adopted to assess the landslide susceptibility. Subsequently, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to obtain the optimal P/N sample ratio, considering the effects of various ratios of training/test set. Finally, the improved models and the corresponding landslide susceptibility maps are established using the obtained optimal P/N sample ratio. The results show that the performance of SVM, RF and GBDT are all improved with the optimized P/N sample ratio. The highest AUC value is for the RF model (0.840, improved by 1.3%), followed by GBDT (0.831, improved by 1.3%), and SVM (0.775, improved by 0.7%). However, the RF and GBDT are more suitable than SVM to address sample unbalance issues in LSA. It is suggested to use the Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize the P/N sample ratio in machine learning-based LSA model.

Accordingly, the construction of forest roads through forests should be carefully planned, especially in protection forests. Forest areas in Turkey are generally widespread in mountainous and high sloping areas that are susceptible to landslides-landslide susceptibility is one of the most important criteria for the selection of protected forests. As such, it is important to evaluate detailed and applicable alternatives regarding special areas and private forests. The aim of this study is to determine alternative routes for forest roads in protected forests through the use of geographic information systems (GIS), particularly in areas with high landslide susceptibility. To this end, a landslide susceptibility map (LSM) was created using logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) modeling methods, which are widely used in machine learning (ML). Two models with the highest receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) values were selected, and ten factors (slope, elevation, lithology, distance to road, distance to fault, distance to river, curvature, stream power index, topographic position index, and topographic wetness index) were used. The best LSM modeling method was AUC. The AUC value was 90.6% with the RF approach and 80.3% with the LR approach. The generated LSMs were used to determine alternative routes that were calculated through cost path analysis. It is hoped that the susceptibility to landslides and selection of alternative forest road routes determined through the approaches and techniques in this study will benefit forest road planning as well as plan and decision makers.

The present research aims to evaluate as well as compare the proficiencies of six advanced machine learning techniques (MLTs) for mapping the landslide susceptibility of northern parts of Pakistan. The considered MLTs include Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), along with Random Forest. The present research was performed applying GIS and R programming language (an open-source software). Primarily, the landslide inventory map was formulated with the help of an overall 3251 historical landslide events obtained through a variety of data sources. All the historical landslide locations were arbitrarily split into two groups with a proportion of 70% for training plus 30% for validating purposes. In total, sixteen landslide influencing factors were considered for modeling landslide susceptibility. These factors comprise aspect, elevation, slope, lithology, fault density, land cover classification system, topographic wetness index, earthquake, sediment transport index, normalized difference vegetation index, rainfall, soil, stream power index, road density, profile curvature, and plan curvature. The receiver operating characteristic, the area under curve (AUC), and root mean square error approaches were employed to appraise, validate, and relate the performance of the practiced MLTs. The outcomes demonstrated that AUC for six MLTs vary from 88.5% for LDA to 92.3% for ANN. The results reveal that among the six practiced MLTs, ANN (AUC = 92.3%) and MARS (AUC = 91.7%) have shown outstanding performances.

Landslides cause huge losses to the economy as well as human beings every year around the globe. Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) plays a key role in the prevention of landslides and has been under investigation for years. Although new machine learning algorithms have achieved excellent performance in terms of prediction accuracy, a sufficient quantity of training samples is essential. In contrast, it is hard to obtain enough landslide samples in most the areas, especially for the county-level area. The present study aims to explore an optimization model in conjunction with conventional unsupervised and supervised learning methods, which performs well with respect to prediction accuracy and com-prehensibility. Logistic regression (LR), fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) and factor analysis (FA) were combined to establish four models: LR model, FCM coupled with LR model, FA coupled with LR model, and FCM, FA coupled with LR model and applied in a specific area. Firstly, an inventory with 114 landslides and 10 conditioning factors was prepared for modeling. Subsequently, four models were applied to LSP. Finally, the performance was evaluated and compared by k-fold cross-validation based on statistical measures. The results showed that the coupled model by FCM, FA and LR achieved the greatest performance among these models with the AUC (Area under the curve) value of 0.827, accuracy of 85.25%, sensitivity of 74.96% and specificity of 86.21%. While the LR model performed the worst with an AUC value of 0.736, accuracy of 77%, sensitivity of 62.52% and specificity of 72.55%. It was concluded that both the dimension reduction and sample size should be considered in modeling, and the performance can be enhanced by combining complementary methods. The combination of models should be more flexible and purposeful.

However, the extensive amount of labeled training data required by machine learning, particularly the precise negative data (i.e., non-landslide area), cannot be easily and efficiently collected. To address this issue, this study presents a one-class-classifier-based negative data generation method for rapid earthquake-induced LSM. First, an incomplete landslide inventory (i.e., positive data) was produced with the aid of change detection using before-and-after satellite images and the Geographic Information System (GIS). Second, a one-class classifier was utilized to compute the probability of landslide occurrence based on the incomplete landslide inventory followed by the negative data generation from the low landslide susceptibility areas. Third, the positive data as well as the generated negative data (i.e., non-landslide) were compounded to train a traditional binary classifier to produce the final LSM. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method is capable of achieving a result that is comparable to methods using the complete landslide inventory, and it displays good correspondence with recent landslide events, making it a suitable method for rapid earthquake-induced LSM. The findings in this study would be useful in regional disaster planning and risk reduction.

In ACO-DBN, DL optimization strategies were added to DBN and their combined parameters were optimized with ACO. Next, Pearson's correlation coefficient and random forest importance ranking methods were utilized to optimize landslide causative factors. Then, the Jiuzhaigou earthquake region was selected as an example to explore the applicability of this model. Besides, we conducted the Wilcoxon signed rank test in order to verify that the differences were statistically significant. In a comprehensive comparative all indexes and landslide density, the model proposed in this article shows good rationality, scientificity, and interpretability.

It involves multiple consecutive stages of statistical prediction, machine learning, and mapping in the GIS environment. At the first stage, a landslide susceptibility map has been developed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) algorithm, coupled with the binary logistic regression (BLR) technique. The AHP model incorporates 11 geo-hydrological and environmental variables as predictors sourced from remote-sensing datasets to generate the LS susceptibility as output. Twenty-three field-based validation locations validate the test result. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the observed (? COMPUTED) and predicted (? PREDICTED) values of LS susceptibility is 0.928 at 0.01 level of significance. At the next stage, the LS risk is evaluated considering the ârisk trio,â i.e., the combination of the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. This stage involves the transformation of a range of qualitative datasets to the virtual workspace of machine learning. The landslide risk output has been predicted with an initial fuzzy model, incorporating a set of 32 rules for membership functions (MF). This initial model uses randomly selected 20% datasets to tailor the fuzzy rules through the adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface (ANFIS). The training to ANFIS results in framing 120 fuzzy rules for the best possible prediction of the outcome. The final LS risk map from the ANFIS output shows that more than 70% area is under high-to-very high LS risk. The model is tested in a 5? Ã 5? grid around the famous hill station Mussoorie in the state of Uttarakhand, India. The model exhibits a satisfactory level of accuracy for the present-study area, which has made us confident to recommend it. The multistage model is worthy of being applied for landslide risk mapping for the similar kinds of study areas, and also for other areas of landslide with necessary customization as deemed necessary.

This study designed a multi-hazard map for three important hazards (earthquakes, floods, and landslides) to identify endangered areas in Kermanshah province located in western Iran using ensemble SWARA-ANFIS-PSO and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO models. In the first step, flood and landslide inventory maps were generated to identify at-risk areas. Then, the occurrence places for each hazard were divided into two groups for training susceptibility models (70%) and testing the models applied (30%). Factors affecting these hazards, including altitude, slope aspect, slope degree, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to the faults, rainfall, lithology, and land use, were used to generate susceptibility maps. The SWARA method was used to weigh the subclasses of the influencing factors in floods and landslides. In addition, a peak ground acceleration (PGA) map was generated to investigate earthquakes in the study area. In the next step, the ANFIS machine learning algorithm was used in combination with PSO and GWO meta-heuristic algorithms to train the data, and SWARA-ANFIS-PSO and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO susceptibility maps were separately generated for flood and landslide hazards. The predictive ability of the implemented models was validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean square error (MSE) methods. The results showed that the SWARA-ANFIS-PSO ensemble model had the best performance in generating flood susceptibility maps with ROC = 0.936, RMS = 0.346, and MSE = 0.120.

An effective multi-hazard risk mitigation strategy includes assessing individual hazards as well as their interactions. However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, multi-hazard susceptibility prediction techniques based on machine learning has encountered a huge bottleneck. In order to effectively solve this problem, this study proposes a multi-hazard susceptibility mapping framework using the classical deep learning algorithm of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). First, we use historical flash flood, debris flow and landslide locations based on Google Earth images, extensive field surveys, topography, hydrology, and environmental data sets to train and validate the proposed CNN method. Next, the proposed CNN method is assessed in comparison to conventional logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor methods using several objective criteria, i.e., coefficient of determination, overall accuracy, mean absolute error and the root mean square error. Experimental results show that the CNN method outperforms the conventional machine learning algorithms in predicting probability of flash floods, debris flows and landslides. Finally, the susceptibility maps of the three hazards based on CNN are combined to create a multi-hazard susceptibility map. It can be observed from the map that 62.43% of the study area are prone to hazards, while 37.57% of the study area are harmless. In hazard-prone areas, 16.14%, 4.94% and 30.66% of the study area are susceptible to flash floods, debris flows and landslides, respectively. In terms of concurrent hazards, 0.28%, 7.11% and 3.13% of the study area are susceptible to the joint occurrence of flash floods and debris flow, debris flow and landslides, and flash floods and landslides, respectively, whereas, 0.18% of the study area is subject to all the three hazards. The results of this study can benefit engineers, disaster managers and local government officials involved in sustainable land management and disaster risk mitigation.

The landslide inventory and ten conditioning factors were first constructed, based on data availability and climate. Subsequently, three tree-based models, decision tree (DT), DT-Boosting, and random forest (RF), were established and compared with the support vector machine (SVM) to analyze the difference in model prediction. Finally, the effect and causes of tree-based algorithms on prediction results were explored based on the working mechanism of the susceptibility model. Results show that there is no multicollinearity among the conditioning factors. The predicted results produced by the tree-based model display the discontinuous distribution compared with the SVM, not only presented in the point-based prediction but the surface-based heterogeneity. Moreover, heterogeneity on the susceptibility map relates to the tree-based algorithm and factor grading, especially the classification of important factors. Besides, DT-Boosting appears the highest numerical features, with large values of AUC (0.981), specificity (0.960), sensitivity (0.956) and accuracy (0.958) in the training phase, and high prediction of AUC (0.862), specificity (0.759), sensitivity (0.843) and accuracy (0.801) in the validation phase. In terms of fluctuation, the RF is smaller than that of DT-Boosting. Further, the susceptibility map generated by RF, with the largest D-value of 7.81, can well capture the difference in landslide susceptibility.

The landslide susceptibility map (LSM) usually helps to mitigate disasters. However, how to accurately predict the susceptibility of landslides is still a difficult point in the field of disaster research. In this study, five advanced machine learning technologies (MLTs), including the Light Gradient Boosting Machine, extreme gradient boost, categorical boosting (CatBoost), support vector machine, and random forest, are utilized to landslide susceptibility modeling and their capabilities are compared through evaluation indicators. The northern part of Yanping, Fujian Province, China, is selected as the research object, because this area experienced mass landslide events due to extremely heavy rainfall in June 2010, resulting in many casualties and a large number of public facilities destroyed. The influencing factors for landslides, namely topographic, hydrological, geologic and human activities, are prepared from various data sources based on the availability. Through the analysis of the actual situation in the study area, 13 suitable landslide condition factors are considered and the availability of relevant factors is checked according to the multicollinearity test. The landslide inventory including 631 samples in this study area is obtained from historical information, satellite data in Google earth and performed field surveys. The landslide inventory is randomly divided into two datasets for model training and testing with a 7:3 ratio. The area under the curve of ROC, accuracy rate, Kappa index and F1 score are applied to compare the MLTs capabilities. In this paper, the results of factor importance analysis show that the first three important condition factors are the distance to faults, the distance to drainages and the slope. According to the LSMs, in the study area, the central and western regions are at high and very high landslide susceptibility levels, while almost all the eastern and northeastern regions are at medium and low landslide susceptibility levels. The CatBoost model is a very promising technology in landslide research according to the evaluation results, which means that for landslide susceptibility research, gradient boosting algorithms may get more accurate results and show better prospects in the future. Finally, the results of this paper will contribute to environmental protection to a certain extent.

We give special attention to the use of geographical information systems, machine learning and statistical techniques to build landslide susceptibility maps. These methods have input as fourteen key causative factors that might influence landslides occurrence.

Long-term interactions between rock uplift and river undercutting developed widely distributed landslides in this catchment, which recorded the typical tectonic geomorphology in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we examined the landslides in the Minjiang catchment and aimed to compare the prediction ability of the statistical and machine learning (ML) models in landslide susceptibility assessment. We adopted the statistical models of the frequency ratio (FR) and information value (IV) models, and the ML models represented by a logistic model tree (LMT) and radial basis function classifier (RBFC) for landslide prediction. An inventory map of 668 landslides was compiled, and the landslides were randomly divided into training (80%) and validation (20%) datasets. Furthermore, 11 control factors of landslides based on topography, geology, hydrology, and other environments were applied for the analysis. The comprehensive performance of the four models was validated and compared using accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results indicated that both sides of the valley along the Mingjiang and Heishuihe Rivers are in the high and very high susceptibility zones; in particular, the river segment from Wenchuan to Maoxian County has the highest susceptibility. The AUC values of the FR, IV, LMT, and RBFC models with the training data were 0.842, 0.862, 0.898, and 0.894, respectively, while the validation dataset illustrated the highest AUC value of 0.879 in the LMT model, followed by the RBFC (0.871), IV (0.869), and FR (0.839) models. Moreover, the LMT and RBFC models had higher accuracy values than the FR and IV models. This suggests that the ML models are superior to the statistical models in generating adequate landslide susceptibility maps, and the LMT model is the most efficient one for landslide prediction in the study region. This study provides a typical case in a landslide-prone region in the plateau margin to advance the understanding of landslide susceptibility assessment.

This concept is widely known as landslide susceptibility. And, it has seen a vast improvement from old bivariate statistical techniques to modern deep learning routines. Despite all these advancements, no spatially-explicit data-driven model is currently capable of also predicting how large landslides may be once they trigger in a specific study area. In this work, we exploit a model architecture that has already found a number of applications in landslide susceptibility. Specifically, we opt for the use of Neural Networks. But, instead of focusing exclusively on where landslides may occur, we extend this paradigm to also spatially predict classes of landslide sizes. As a result, we keep the traditional binary classification paradigm but we make use of it to complement the susceptibility estimates with a crucial information for landslide hazard assessment. We will refer to this model as Hierarchical Neural Network (HNN) throughout the manuscript. To test this analytical protocol, we use the Nepalese area where the Gorkha earthquake induced tens of thousands of landslides on the 25th of April 2015. The results we obtain are quite promising. The component of our HNN that estimates the susceptibility outperforms a binomial Generalized Linear Model (GLM) baseline we used as benchmark. We did this for a GLM represents the most common classifier in the landslide literature. Most importantly, our HNN also suitably performed across the entire procedure. As a result, the landslide-area-class prediction returned not just a single susceptibility map, as per tradition. But, it also produced several informative maps on the expected landslide size classes. Our vision is for administrations to consult these suite of model outputs and maps to better assess the risk to local communities and infrastructure. And, to promote the diffusion of our HNN, we are sharing the data and codes in a githubsec repository in the hope that we would stimulate others to replicate similar analyses.

As a result, the present study intends to assess the effect of future landslide on different ecosystem services in Aqabat Al-Sulbat regions. In the present study, landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) at different return periods as a proxy of future landslide have been generated with integration of ensemble machine learning algorithms. Stacking framework based on bagging, dagging, and artificial neural network (ANN) along with random forest has been proposed to generate LSMs. Also, bagging, dagging, and ANN have been applied individually. Receiver operational characteristics (ROC curve)Â were used to validate the LSM model against reality. The best LSM predicting model determined by the ROC curve was used to create future LSM maps by combining rainfall at 2â100Â year return periods (using Gumble extreme value distribution). The potential loss of ecosystem services value in the Aqabat Al-Sulbat region was estimated. All models anticipate 6â16Â km2 and 27â41Â km2 of the study region as very high and high land susceptibility (LS) zones, respectively. According to the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve, stacking-bagging outperformed all other models (AUC: 0.91). While the region encompassed by very high LS zones would steadily rise from 2 to 100Â year return periods (6.1â20.44Â km2). As a result, ecosystem services (ES) would be destroyed as well. The results revealed that the ES generating region with zero value will steadily expand with increasing return periods (39â42Â km2) owing to the expansion of high LS zones. The research delivers reliable spatially explicit results in order to influence policy decisions on forest management investment, landslide management, and development activity management as well as replication possibilities in other data sparse places.

Previous studies have shown that no single model performs best across diverse geoenvironmental conditions. To seek better prediction accuracy and reliability, this study proposes three different ensemble methods to take advantage of multiple landslide susceptibility models: qualitative matrix ensemble method, semi-quantitative partition ensemble method, and quantitative probability-weighted ensemble method. To illustrate the effectiveness of the three ensemble methods proposed, a case study is carried out in Fengjie County in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China. First, with the support of geographic information system, a total of 1550 historical landslides and the associated 12 conditioning factors are compiled, which are used for the training and validation of four selected single landslide susceptibility models, including two statistical approaches (i.e. frequency ratio and fuzzy assessment) and two machine learning approaches (i.e. backpropagation neural network and support vector machine). Then, the three ensemble methods are applied to integrate the outcomes of the four single models. Finally, an extensive comparative analysis is performed between the ensemble methods and single models using the receiver operating characteristics curve and information entropy. The results demonstrate that all the three ensemble methods achieve higher overall prediction accuracy (> 80%) than the four single models (< 80%), and the matrix ensemble method provides the best improvement. Besides, the ensemble methods can also enhance reliability by reducing the statistical discrepancy between distinct single models.

Therefore, it is of great significance to build a collapse and landslide susceptibility evaluation model in Wenchuan County for local disaster prevention and mitigation. Taking Wenchuan County as the research object and according to the data of 1081 historical collapse and landslide disaster points, as well as the natural environment, this paper first selects six categories of environmental factors (13 environmental factors in total) including topography (slope, aspect, curva-ture, terrain relief, TWI), geological structure (lithology, soil type, distance to fault), meteorology and hydrology (rainfall, distance to river), seismic impact (PGA), ecological impact (NDVI), and impact of human activity (land use). It then builds three single models (LR, SVM, RF) and three CF-based hybrid models (CF-LR, CF-SVM, CF-RF), and makes a comparative analysis of the accuracy and reliability of the models, thereby obtaining the optimal model in the research area. Finally, this study discusses the contribution of environmental factors to the collapse and the landslide susceptibility prediction of the optimal model. The research results show that (1) the areas prone to extremely high collapse and landslide predicted by the six models (LR, CF-LR, SVM, CF-SVM, RF and CF-RF) have an area of 730.595 km2, 377.521 km2, 361.772 km2, 372.979 km2, 318.631 km2, and 306.51 km2, respectively, and the frequency ratio precision of collapses and landslides is 0.916, 0.938, 0.955, 0.956, 0.972, and 0.984, respectively; (2) the ranking of the comprehensive index based on the confusion matrix is CF-RF&gt;RF&gt;CF-SVM&gt;CF-LR&gt;SVM&gt;LR and the ranking of the AUC value is CF-RF&gt;RF&gt;CF-SVM&gt;CF-LR&gt;SVM&gt;LR.

Most of the recent publications focused on quantitative analysis, i.e., improving data processing methods, comparing and perfecting the data-driven model itself, but rarely taking the qualitative aspects of the local landslide occurrences into consideration and the further analysis of the key features was always lacking. This study aims to combine qualitative and quantitative analysis and examine its effect on mapping accuracy; based on the feature importance ranks and the related literature, the key features for identifying landslide/non-landslide points of different sub-zones were further analyzed. Before modeling, the study area Yunyang County, Chongqing City, China, was manually divided into four sub-zones based on the information from geological hazards explo-ration in Chongqing, including the mechanism of landslide formation and sliding failure and geo-morphic unit characteristics. Upon the qualitative analysis basis, five grid searches tuned random forest models (one for the whole region and four for the sub-zones independently) were established by 1654 data points and 20 conditioning features. Compared with the conventional data-driven method, the integrated quantitative evaluation based on the qualitative analysis results showed higher reliability, which not only improved the mapping accuracy but also increased the AUC val-ues of all four sub-models, which were 8.8%, 2.3%, 1.9% and 9.1% higher than that of the parent model. Moreover, the quantitative evaluation based on the qualitative analysis revealed the key factors affecting local landslide formation.

This study focused on small-scale landslide susceptibility (LS) maps as well as hotspot zones of earthquake and landslide on the Himalayas. Remote sensing, geological, and hydrological data were collected and processed using the geographic information system (GIS) for this purpose. Seventeen landslide influential causative factors (LICFs) were used, which included slope, aspect, elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), terrain ruggedness index (TRI), drainage density, distance to drainage, seismic zone, soil texture, geology, and land use and land cover (LULC). The machine learning (ML) neural network and deep learning models, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), artificial neural network (ANN), deep learning neural network (DLNN), and Getis-Ord GI*, have been applied for landslide susceptibility (LS) maps, and earthquake and landslide hotspot maps respectively of the Himalayas. The LS maps were compared with the earthquake and landslide hotspot zones, and there is valid agreement among these. The results of the susceptibility mapping were validated by the confusion matrix table and sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precession, F score, and kappa statistical indices. The validation result showed that all the landslide susceptibility models (LSMs) have a near 90% prediction rate. Among the four models, the DLNN models have the highest prediction accuracy followed by LDA, QDA, and ANN. The small-scale LS maps of the Himalayas may help planners and developers for macro-scale mitigation of landslide hazard and land use planning.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in deep learning have been successfully applied to LSM studies and have been shown to improve the accuracy of LSM. Although optimizing the quality of negative samples at the input step of a deep learning model can improve the accuracy of the model, the risk of model overfitting may increase. In this study, an LSM method based on the Gaussian heatmap sampling technique and a CNN was developed from the perspective of LSM dataset sampling. A Gaussian heatmap sampling technique was used to enrich the variety of landslide inventory at the input step of the deep learning model to improve the accuracy of the LSM results. This sampling technique involved the construction of a landslide susceptibility Gaussian heatmap neural network model, LSGH-Net, by combining a CNN. A series of optimization strategies such as attention mechanism, dropout, etc., were applied to improve the model structure and training process. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach outperformed the benchmark CNN-based algorithm in terms of metrics (Accuracy = 95.30%, F1 score = 95.13%, and Sensitivity = 91.79%). The Gaussian heatmap sampling technique effectively improved the accuracy of frequency histograms of the landslide susceptibility index, which provided finer-grained mapping details and more reasonable landslide density. By analyzing Gaussian heatmap at different scales, the approach proposed in this paper is an important reference for different regions and other disaster susceptibility studies as well.

In some cases, the complex behaviors of some such phenomena cause that single machine learning models fail in modeling them well. To overcome this issue, this paper presents two novel genetic-algorithm (GA)-based ensemble models constructed with the decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB) models based on the bagging and random sub-space (RS) methods for landslide susceptibility assessment and mapping in Ajloun and Jerash governorates in Jordan. Sixteen factors, including topographic, climatic, human, and geological factors were used as possible factors that influence landslide occurrence in the study area. In addition to this, one hundred and ninety two landslide locations were employed for training and testing the models. The GA was used in this study for feature selection based on three models: DT, KNN, and NB. Model performance evaluation based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve indicated that the ensemble models outperform the standalone ones. The values of the AUROC curves in the validation phases for the five models, namely, the GA-based DT, KNN, NB, bagging-based, and RS-based ensemble model, were 0.63, 0.69, 0.63, 0.89, and 0.95, respectively. The results of this study suggest that simple models can be combined using the bagging and RS methods to produce integrated models that have higher accuracy than that of any of the individual simple models.

The development of urbanisation has led to the expansion of residential areas in mountainous areas, and human activities have accelerated slope instability. However, the limited data records in mountainous zones have resulted in low-precision landslide rainfall thresholds. Establishing a landslide early warning model in areas with scarce data is an unresolved problem. This study uses the Bailong River Basin in western China as an example. By downscaling Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data to a daily resolution of 1 km and conditionally merging it with ground station rainfall, we obtain high-precision rainfall data to establish rainfall threshold curves based on Bayes' theorem and the frequency method. Subsequently, a landslide susceptibility map based on deep learning was integrated to construct a regional landslide early warning model. The results are as follows: First, compared with downscaling rainfall and rain gauge interpolation data, the daily rainfall data with a resolution of 1 km that combines the two has better overall performance and higher accuracy. Second, we generated the event-rainfall-and-duration threshold curves of 5%, 20%, and 50% probability by combining the frequency method and Bayesian theorem, and show that with a probability of landslide occurrence of 50%, while the intercept of Bayes' theorem is greater than that of the frequency method, the overall trend is consistent. Finally, by using a typical mass rainfall event to test the performance, the results show that the early warning capability of the model integrated with the rainfall threshold and landslide susceptibility map is more accurate than that of using a separate rainfall threshold. The outcomes of this research are expected to provide efficient support for early warning and risk management of geological disasters in mountainous areas with scarce data.

The existing research has not fully consid-ered the potential impact of the spatial agglomeration and dispersion of landslides on assessments. This issue may cause a systematic evaluation bias when the field investigation data are insufficient, which is common due to limited human resources. Accordingly, this paper proposes two novel strate-gies, including a clustering algorithm and a preprocessing method, for these two ignored features to strengthen assessments, especially in high-susceptibility regions. Multiple machine learning models are compared in a case study of the city of Bijie (Guizhou Province, China). Then we generate the optimal susceptibility map and conduct two experiments to test the validity of the proposed methods. The primary conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) random forest (RF) was superior to other algorithms in the recognition of high-susceptibility areas and the portrayal of local spatial features; (2) the susceptibility map incorporating spatial feature messages showed a noticeable improvement over the spatial distribution and gradual change of susceptibility, as well as the accurate delineation of critical hazardous areas and the interpretation of historical hazards; and (3) the spatial distribution feature had a significant positive effect on modeling, as the accuracy increased by 5% and 10% after including the spatial agglomeration and dispersion consideration in the RF model, respectively. The benefit of the agglomeration is concentrated in high-susceptibility areas, and our work provides insight to improve the assessment accuracy in these areas, which is critical to risk assessment and prevention activities.

Among them, earthquake-induced landslides are extremely disastrous, causing considerable social and economic losses and damage to the ecology and environment. Therefore, it is of great significance to accurately predict the spatial distribution of earthquake-induced landslides. The research in this paper focuses on ten extremely earthquake-stricken areas of the Wenchuan earthquake; landslide hazard data are collected from the study areas, and the terrain information entropy, distance to rivers, distance to faults, distance to roads, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), peak ground acceleration (PGA) and other landslide conditioning factors are extracted. Combined with a deep neural network (DNN), a landslide hazard spatial prediction model is constructed. Through Dataset 1 and Dataset 2, which are generated randomly, the training dataset (70%) and the validation dataset (30%) are divided to verify the robustness and accuracy of the model, and the landslide susceptibility map of the study area is obtained. Moreover, considering the area under curve (AUC), the impacts of different conditioning factors on the landslide hazard prediction model are analyzed. The research results show that the DNN-based landslide hazard spatial prediction model (AUCMean = 93.66%, RecallMean = 85.70%) has a better prediction performance in the training step. From the validation step, the influences of various factors on the spatial prediction model of landslide hazards established in this paper (from high to low) are as follows: distance to faults, lithology, distance to rivers, PGA, terrain information entropy, NDVI, and distance to roads. The landslide hazard point data and landslide susceptibility map are highly consistent, indicating that the application of a deep learning algorithm in hazard susceptibility assessment is effective and can provide a scientific basis for landslide hazard early warning and disaster prevention and mitigation in mountainous areas prone to earthquake disasters.

This study used a statistical ensemble model (frequency ratio and evidence belief function) and two machine learning (ML) models (random forest and XGBoost; eXtreme Gradient Boosting) for LSM in the province of Belluno (region of Veneto, northeastern Italy). The study investigated the importance of the conditioning factors in predicting landslide occurrences using the mentioned models. In this paper, we evaluated the importance of the conditioning factors in the overall prediction capabilities of the statistical and ML algorithms. By the trial-and-error method, we eliminated the least ""important""features by using a common threshold of 0.30 for statistical and 0.03 for ML algorithms. Conclusively, we found that removing the least important features does not impact the overall accuracy of LSM for all three models. Based on the results of our study, the most commonly available features, for example, the topographic features, contributes to comparable results after removing the least important ones, namely the aspect plan and profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic roughness index (TRI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the case of the statistical model and the plan and profile curvature, TWI, and topographic position index (TPI) for ML algorithms. This confirms that the requirement for the important conditioning factor maps can be assessed based on the physiography of the region.

In northern Pakistan, landslides due to vigorous seismic zones, monsoon rainfall, extremely sheer slopes, and unfavorable geological conditions present a considerable threat to the mountain areas.

The central objective of the analysis is to analyze different convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks and residual network (ResNet) that were constructed by developing distinct data representation algorithms for landslide susceptibility assessment and compare the results. This study considers sixteen landslide conditioning factors related to the incident of landslides centered on the literature review and geologic attributes of the pondered area.

Several commonly exploited measures were used to validate the CNN architectures and ResNet by comparing them with the most prevalent machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The outcomes of this study revealed that the proportions of regions having very high susceptibility in all the landslide susceptibility maps of the ResNet model and CNN models are considerably alike and less than 20%, which implies that the CNN models are significantly helpful in managing and preventing landslides as to the orthodox techniques. Moreover, the suggested CNN architectures and ResNet attained greater or similar prediction accuracy than other orthodox ML and DL techniques.

Thus, to overcome these limitations, this study proposed an improved clustering algorithm titled the DBSCAN-AHD algorithm, which combines the traditional DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise) algorithm and an Adaptive Hausdorff Distance (AHD) for landslide susceptibility modeling. Firstly, AHD was introduced to the traditional DBSCAN to quantify rainfall. Then, the DBSCAN-AHD grouped the mapping units with similar topology and geology characteristics into subclasses without specifying the number of clusters in advance for its ability to handle noise in the data. Furthermore, the LD-EV (landslide density or eigenvalues) approach was introduced to obtain the susceptibility levels using K-means algorithm. Finally, to verify the modelâs performance, statistical indices and the area under the curve (AUC) were applied and compared to the traditional DBSCAN, KPSO, K-means and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms, whereby, the proposed model outperformed the others.

However, this increased performance is often accompanied by increased model complexity and decreased interpretability, resulting in critiques of their âblack boxâ nature, which highlights the need for algorithms that can offer both strong predictive performance and interpretability. This is especially true when the global model and predictions for specific data points need to be explainable in order for the model to be of use. Explainable boosting machines (EBM), an augmentation and refinement of generalize additive models (GAMs), has been proposed as an empirical modeling method that offers both interpretable results and strong predictive performance. The trained model can be graphically summarized as a set of functions relating each predictor variable to the dependent variable along with heat maps representing interactions between selected pairs of predictor variables. In this study, we assess EBMs for predicting the likelihood or probability of slope failure occurrence based on digital terrain characteristics in four separate Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) in the state of West Virginia, USA and compare the results to those obtained with LR, kNN, RF, and SVM. EBM provided predictive accuracies comparable to RF and SVM and better than LR and kNN. The generated functions and visualizations for each predictor variable and included interactions between pairs of predictor variables, estimation of variable importance based on average mean absolute scores, and provided scores for each predictor variable for new predictions add interpretability, but additional work is needed to quantify how these outputs may be impacted by variable correlation, inclusion of interaction terms, and large feature spaces. Further exploration of EBM is merited for geohazard mapping and modeling in particular and spatial predictive mapping and modeling in general, especially when the value or use of the resulting predictions would be greatly enhanced by improved interpretability globally and availability of prediction explanations at each cell or aggregating unit within the mapped or modeled extent.

The proposed algorithm addresses these issues by integrating the traditional Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) and Overlapped Interval Divergence distance measure (OLID) methods into landslide susceptibility assessment to enhance its performance. It considers the clusters sizes as well the distances between them and tends to avoid taking into consideration small clusters which are very far from other clusters in the dataset. It is also insensitive to the variation in sizes, variances and shapes of the clusters, which makes the algorithm more advantageous. Besides, the AHC-OLID algorithm makes use of the OLID distance function to process the rainfall data, which takes two factors into consideration: distance between their centers as well as relative size of their overlapped area. Applying this new approach in Baota District, China, produced significant improvement in assessment of landslide susceptibility than previous models. Moreover, the Landslide susceptibility map constructed based on AHC-OLID algorithm can be a useful tool for landslide controlling strategies for proper land use and planning.

Landslides occur in hilly and mountainous areas all over the world. Single, ensemble, and hybrid machine learning (ML) models have been used in landslide studies for better landslide susceptibility mapping and risk management. In the present study, we have used three single ML models, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), and radial basis function network (RBFN), for landslide susceptibility mapping at Pithoragarh district, as these models are easy to apply and so far they have not been used for landslide study in this area. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of these single models for correctly identifying landslide susceptible zones for their further application in other areas. For this, ten important landslide affecting factors, namely, slope, aspect, curvature, elevation, land cover, lithology, geomorphology, distance to rivers, distance to roads, and overburden depth based on the local geoenvironmental conditions, were considered for the modeling. Landslide inventory of past 398 landslide events was used in the development of models. The data of past landslide events (locations) was randomly divided into a 70/30 ratio for training (70%) and validation (30%) of the models. Standard statistical measures, namely, accuracy (ACC), specificity (SPF), sensitivity (SST), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), Kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results indicated that the performance of all the models is very good (AUC > 0.90) and that of the LR model is the best (AUC = 0.926). Therefore, these single ML models can be used for the development of accurate landslide susceptibility maps. Our study demonstrated that the single models which are easy to use and can compete with the complex ensemble/hybrid models can be applied for landslide susceptibility mapping in landslide-prone areas.

There has been a rapid increase in studies to identify ground dynamics in areas with the potential for landslides. Landslide susceptibility maps are created using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms based on geographic information systems to identify possible failures in selected areas. The aim of this study is to train different spatial data with machine learning algorithms to determine susceptible landslide areas, so as to analyze soil properties with the Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) method, which is a fundamental shallow surface seismic surveying method in geophysical engineering. Also Refraction Microtremor (Re-Mi) method applied in some stations to detect shear wave velocity (V s) up to engineering bedrock level. Obtained velocity values of soil layers from different seismic methods and historical records were used together to train the model. The seismic surveying results were used for the first time to train the machine learning algorithms to detect high susceptible areas for landslides. Some of the MASW applications were carried out in landslide areas and others in areas considered to be risky. Thus, with the contribution of the seismic method, the dynamic behavior that may occur was analyzed. All the measurements carried out in the Girne (Kyrenia) Mountains terrane. Consequently, it has been determined that the northeast-facing slopes of the Girne Mountains are the highest sensitivity for landslide, in other words, the most active in terms of ground dynamics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",International Journal of Geosynthetics and Ground Engineering,10.1007/s40891-023-00471-w,1,1,Yes,"SVM,RF",,Turkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, Muchuan County was selected as the study area, and four well-known machine learning models were adopted, namely, rotation forest (RF), J48 decision tree (J48), alternating decision tree (ADTree) and random forest (RaF). They and their ensembles (RF-J48, RF-ADTree and RF-RaF) were applied to landslide spatial prediction in Muchuan County. Eleven landslide conditioning factors, including plan curvature, profile curvature, slope angle, elevation, topographic wetness index, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, soil, lithology, distance to roads and distance to rivers, were established. In addition, 279 landslide datasets were compiled and randomly divided into 195 landslide training datasets and 84 landslide verification datasets. The contributions of the eleven conditioning factors were analyzed by J48, ADTree, and RaF models, respectively. The results show that lithology, slope angle, elevation, land use, soil, and distance to roads were the six principal landslide conditioning factors. Then, the Jenks natural break method was used to divide the landslide susceptibility maps into five grades. In addition, the accuracy of the above six models was verified by implementing the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

With the potential uncertainty of susceptibility changes in mountain environments due to different precipitation thresholds related to climate change, it becomes important to evaluate these changes. In this study, we employed a machine learning approach (logistic models) to assess susceptibility changes to landslides in the Central Andes. We integrated geomorphological features such as slope and slope curvature, and precipitation data on different days before the landslide. We then split the data into a calibration and validation database in a 50/50% ratio, respectively. The results showed an area under the curve (AUC) performance of over 0.790, indicating the model’s capacity to represent prone-landslide changes based on geomorphological and precipitation antecedents. We further evaluated susceptibility changes using different precipitation scenarios by integrating Intensity/Duration/Frequency (IDF) products based on CHIRPS data. We concluded that this methodology could be implemented as a Rainfall-Induced Landslides Early Warning System (RILEWS) to forecast RIL occurrence zones and constrain precipitation thresholds. Our study estimates that half of the basin area in the study zone showed a 59% landslide probability for a return of two years at four hours. Given the extent and high population in the area, authorities must increase monitoring over unstable slopes or generate landslide early warning at an operational scale to improve risk management. We encourage decision-makers to focus on better understanding and analysing short-duration extreme events, and future urbanization and public infrastructure designs must consider RIL impact. © 2023 by the authors.",Water (Switzerland),10.3390/w15142514,1,1,Yes,LOGR,,Chile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intrinsic vulnerability of settlements, due to poverty and poor governance, as well as the lack of tools for urban occupation planning and mitigation protocols, has made such impacts particularly severe. Cuenca (Ecuador) is a significant example of a city that in recent decades has experienced considerable population growth (i.e. exposure) and an associated increase in loss due to landslide occurrence. Despite such effects, updated urban planning tools are absent, so an evaluation of multitemporal exposure to landslides and related risks is required. In this perspective, a potential urban planning tool is presented based on updated data depicting the spatial distribution of landslides and their predisposing factors, as well as population change between 2010 and 2020. In addition, a multitemporal analysis accounting for changes in exposure between 2010 and 2020 and an estimation of relative landside risk was carried out. Due to the absence of spatially distributed population data, energy supply contract data have been used as a proxy of the population. The results show that the current higher exposure and related relative risk are estimated for parishes (parroquias) located in the southern sector of the study area (i.e. Turi, Santa Ana, Tarqui, Nulti, Baños and Paccha). Moreover, the exposure multitemporal analysis indicates that most parishes located in the hilly areas bounding the city centre (i.e. Sayausi, San Joaquin, Tarqui, Sidcay, Baños, Ricaurte, Paccha and Chiquintad) are experiencing sustained population growth and will be potentially exposed to an increased risk with a consistently growing trend. The obtained relative risk map can be considered a valuable tool for guiding land planning, land management, occupation restriction and early warning strategy adoption in the area. The methodological approach used, which accounts for landslide susceptibility and population variation through proxy data analysis, has the potential to be applied in a similar context of growing population cities in low- to mid-income countries, where data usually needed for a comprehensive landslide risk analysis are non-existing or only partially available. © 2023, The Author(s).",Landslides,10.1007/s10346-023-02065-z,1,1,Yes,MENT,,"Italy,Ecuador",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the significant progress in LSM research over the past two decades, several long-standing issues, such as uncertainties related to training samples and model selection, remain inadequately addressed in the literature. In this study, we employed a physically based susceptibility model, PISA-m, to generate four different non-landslide data scenarios and combine them with mapped landslides from Magoffin County, Kentucky, for model training. We utilized two Bayesian network model structures, Naïve Bayes (NB) and Tree-Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN), to produce LSMs based on regional geomorphic conditions. After internal validation, we evaluated the robustness and reliability of the models using an independent landslide inventory from Owsley County, Kentucky. The results revealed considerable differences between the most effective model in internal validation (AUC = 0.969), which used non-landslide samples extracted exclusively from low susceptibility areas predicted by PISA-m, and the models’ unsatisfactory performance in external validation, as manifested by the identification of only 79.1% of landslide initiation points as high susceptibility areas. The obtained results from both internal and external validation highlighted the potential overfitting problem, which has largely been overlooked by previous studies. Additionally, our findings also indicate that TAN models consistently outperformed NB models when training datasets were the same due to the ability to account for variables’ dependencies by the former. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15123200,1,1,Yes,NB,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yanshan County was selected as the case study. The multicollinearity diagnoses Spearman’s and ReliefF were applied to judge the proper factors for modeling landslide susceptibility, and the results demonstrate that plan curvature and topographic wetness index are not proper factors in Yanshan County; hence, these factors were not used. Based on several statistical indices, the three integrated models achieve better results than the MLP model. MultiboostAB-MLP is a more stable and effective model, and the three integrated models were better than the existing machine learning algorithm.

Modeling and predicting the possibility of landslides are important in order to monitor and prevent their negative consequences. In this study, landslides are the primary research object. Further, the frequency ratio (FR) method was applied to the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT) regression algorithms for landslide sensitivity assessment. It was also applied to landslide risk assessment mapping in the Longmen Mountain area. Therefore, taking into account the positive and negative sample balance, 7774 historical landslide points and 7774 non-landslide points were selected and divided them into training sets and test sets. The influence factors were selected and analyzed through multicollinearity analysis and the FR method. To improve the performance of the model and the accuracy of the findings, the individual environmental factors are normalized. Subsequently, the LSI (landslide susceptibility index), was obtained by calculating the frequency ratio. Following this, the RF, SVM, and DT were used to construct the model. The trained model calculates the landslide probability of each cell in the study area and generates the resultant susceptibility map. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and R 2 of this region were calculated to evaluate the model’s performance. The results indicate that RF obtained the highest predictive performance (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82) in landslide risk prediction, followed by SVM (AUC = 0.8) and DT (AUC = 0.69).

Based on Sentinel-1 data, relevant data, and existing research results, the information value method (IV), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) models were selected to analyze landslide susceptibility in the urban area of Wanzhou. Models with superior performance will be coupled with PS-InSAR deformation data using two methods: joint training and weighted overlay. The accuracy of different models was assessed and compared with the aim of determining the optimal coupling model and the role of InSAR in the model. The results indicate that the accuracy of different landslide susceptibility prediction models is ranked as RF > SVM > CNN > IV. Among the coupled dynamic models, the performance ranking was as follows: InSAR jointly trained RF (IJRF) > InSAR weighted overlay RF (IWRF) > InSAR jointly trained SVM (IJSVM) > InSAR weighted overlay SVM (IWSVM). Notably, the IJRF model, which combines InSAR deformation data through joint training, exhibited the highest accuracy, with an AUC value of 0.995. In the factor importance analysis within the IJRF model, InSAR deformation data ranked third after hydrological distance (0.210) and elevation (0.163), with a value of 0.154. A comparison between landslide dynamic susceptibility mapping (LDSM) and landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) revealed that the inclusion of InSAR deformation data effectively reduced false positives around the landslide areas. The results suggest that joint training is the most suitable coupling method, allowing for the optimal expression of InSAR deformation data and enhancing the predictive accuracy of the model.

MLAs provide insights for reliable prediction and understanding of the processes and risk of hazards at various scales. This paper integrated multiple MLAs, including hierarchical clusters (HCs) and multilayer perceptron networks (MPN1, MPN2 and MPN3), in investigating soil erosion and landslide susceptibility in Southeast Nigeria. The developed HCs efficiently ranked the susceptibility and risks of the studied gullies. MPN1 predicted the cohesion and ϕ of the gully soils, with its area under curve ranging from 0.857 to 1.000 for cohesion and R2 for ϕ at 0.643. MPN2 predicted the factor of safety (FS) for dry and wet climatic conditions (based on geotechnical variables), having R2 in the range of 0.880–0.902. MPN3 predicted the FS for both conditions (based on estimated geometrical variables and porewater pressures) and expressed R2 ranging from 0.655 to 0.685. The findings of this study bear positive significances for erosion and landslide risk analysts and managers. Moreover, the MPN models support the motion that high accuracy thresholds would be realized when the findings are utilized for risk planning and management. The use of these MLAs has proven to be economical and much more usable and manageable than tedious and expensive conventional experimental works. However, continued research is encouraged in this subject area, in order to develop newer models that would consider variety of other erosion and landslide causative factors and possibly validate or update the findings of the present paper. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.",International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,10.1007/s13762-022-04714-7,1,1,Yes,ANN,,Nigeria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, several ensemble methods (Dagging, Bagging, and Decorate) and a radial basis function classifier (RBFC) were combined to predict landslide susceptibility in the Trung Khanh district of the Cao Bang Province, Vietnam. The ensemble models were developed using a geospatial database containing 45 historical landslides (1074 points) and thirteen influencing variables characterizing the topography, geology, land use/cover, and human activities of the study area. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and several other performance metrics, including positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity (SST), specificity (SPF), accuracy (ACC), and root mean square error (RMSE). The Bagging-RBFC model with PPV = 86%, NPV = 95%, SST = 95%, SPF = 87%, ACC = 91%, RMSE = 0.297, and AUC = 98% was found to be the most accurate model for the prediction of landslide susceptibility, followed by the Dagging-RBFC, Decorate-RBFC, and single RBFC models.

More specifically, the study area around the Bogotá-Villavicencio road in the central sector of the Eastern Cordillera is one of the regions with the highest concentration of phenomena, which makes its study a priority. An inventory and detailed analysis of 2506 landslides has been carried out, in which five basic typologies have been differentiated: avalanches, debris flows, slides, earth flows and creeping areas. Debris avalanches and debris flows occur mainly in metamorphic materials (phyllites, schists and quartz-sandstones), areas with sparse vegetation, steep slopes and lower sections of hillslopes; meanwhile, slides, earth flows and creep occur in Cretaceous lutites, crop/grass lands, medium and low slopes and lower-middle sections of the hillslopes. Based on this analysis, landslide susceptibility models have been made for the different typologies and with different methods (matrix, discriminant analysis, random forest and neural networks) and input factors. The results are generally quite good, with average AUC-ROC values above 0.7–0.8, and the machine learning methods are the most appropriate, especially random forest, with a selected number of factors (between 6 and 8).

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) plays a key role in landslide hazard management. Machine learning (ML) models are widely used in LSM but suffer from limitations such as overfitting and unreliable accuracy. To improve the classification performance of a single machine learning (ML) model, this study selects logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and proposes a novel heterogeneous ensemble framework based on Bayesian optimization (BO), namely, stratified weighted averaging (SWA), to test its applicability in a typical landslide area in Yanbian Prefecture, China. Firstly, a dataset consisting of 1531 historical landslides was collected from field investigations and historical records, and a spatial database containing 16 predisposing factors was established. The dataset was divided into a training set and a test set in a ratio of 7:3. The results showed that SWA effectively improved the Accuracy, AUC, and robustness of the model compared to a single ML model. The SWA achieved the best classification results (Accuracy = 91.39% and AUC = 0.967). To verify the generalization ability of SWA, we selected published landslide datasets from Yanshan country and Yongxin country in China for testing. SWA also performed well, with an AUC of 0.871 and 0.860, respectively. As indicated by shapely values (SVs), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the factor that has the greatest impact on landslide occurrence.

However, landslide boundaries and their spatial shapes are typically presented as irregular polygonal surfaces, such as semicircles and bumps. To study the influence of different landslide boundaries on modeling uncertainty, 370 landslides and 11 environmental factors in Ruijin were chosen in order to establish landslide boundaries and their frequency ratio correlations with environmental factors. Then, these borders were formed, utilizing, respectively, landslide points, buffer circles, and precisely encoded and drawn polygons. Then, models like Point, Circle, and Polygon-based DBN and RF were built using deep belief network (DBN) and random forest (RF). Finally, the distribution pattern of the susceptibility index and its variability were used, along with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) accuracy, to analyze the modeling uncertainty.

However, the obvious surface rupture zones usually do not occur in some buried-fault earthquake cases, which means information about the distance to the surface rupture is lacking. In this study, a new influencing factor named coseismic ground deformation was added to remedy this shortcoming. The Mid-Niigata prefecture earthquake was regarded as the study case. To select a more suitable model for generating the landslide susceptibility map, three commonly used models named logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) were also conducted to assess landslide susceptibility. The performances of these three models were evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic curve. The calculated results showed that the ANN model has the highest area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.82. As the earthquake triggered more landslides in the epicenter area, which makes it more prone to landslides in further earthquakes, the susceptibility analysis at two different mapping scales (the whole study area and the epicenter area) was also applied.

For this, the main aim of the current research is to synthesize the three natural resources (groundwater, wetland, and forest) into one multi-resource (MR) potentiality map and three natural hazards (flood, landslide, and shoreline erosion) into one multi-hazard (MH) susceptibility map. To achieve this goal, several inventories, geo-environmental factors, satellite bands, and indices have been taken as input data sets. Random forest (RF) model has been considered for individual mapping (except shoreline erosion mapping) due to its high precision. For shoreline erosion mapping, digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) model has been employed. The accuracies of the model have been determined from the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, producer accuracy (PA), and user accuracy (UA). RF model has more than 90% prediction accuracy in different resource and hazard mapping, whereas for the forest mapping, PA and UA are 90% and 80%, respectively. The results of this study for multi-resource mapping show forest (24.05%) and groundwater (22.28%) as the major resources, whereas flood (17.27%) is the most destructive in comparison with other hazards.

This work establishes integrated criteria of potential landslide recognition and combines the historical landslides and newly-identified potential landslides to improve the accuracy, rationality, and practicability of a LSE map. Moreover, slope units can well reflect the topographic constraint to landslide occurrence and development, and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can well portray the topological and feature relation among various slope units. The combination of slope units and GCN is for the first time employed in LSE. This work focuses on Wanzhou District, a famous landslide-serious region in the Three Gorges reservoir area, and employs multisource data to conduct potential landslide recognition and LSE and to reveal the distribution characteristics of high landslide susceptibility. Some new viewpoints are suggested as follows. 1) The established criteria of potential landslide recognition consist of the characteristics of active deformation, stratum and lithology, tectonics, topography, micro-geomorphology, environment, meteorology, earthquakes, and human engineering activity. These criteria can well eliminate 4 types of false alarm regions and is successfully validated by field survey. 2) 34 potential landslides are newly discovered, and the movement of these potential landslides were controlled or induced by the combined action of soft-hard interbedding rock mass, steep topography, frequent tectonic movement, strong fluvial erosion, abundant precipitation, and intensive road and building construction. 3) The GCN algorithm reaches a relatively high accuracy (AUC: 0.941) and outperforms the other representative machine learning algorithms of Convolutional Neural Network (AUC: 0.926), Support Vector Machine (AUC: 0.835), and CART Tree (AUC: 0.762). 4) High landslide susceptibility is caused by the coupled action of weathered rock cavities, soft rock and swelling soil, strong river erosion, abundant rainfall, and intensive human engineering activity.

Landslides lead to severe economic damage and property loss, as well as fatalities. Furthermore, they tend to increase in the context of climate change. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively assess landslide susceptibility across the Hengduan Mountain Region in southwest China. Specifically, the analysis is focused on the eastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau within the context of future climate change scenarios, which are based on the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) global climate model ensemble. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) were selected in order to map landslide susceptibility within the context of 1.5–4.0 °C warming scenarios. This was achieved by considering the changes in extreme rainfall that exceeded the landslide triggering thresholds. The results show that the frequency over extreme rainfall thresholds (FOERT) tend to increase in conjunction with warming targets, thereby ranging from 2.3/a (at a 1.5 °C warming) to 9.0/a (at a 4.0 °C warming) on average. Such elevated extreme precipitation events contribute to an increase in projected future zones of high landslide susceptibility when compared to the historical baseline period ranging from −1.2% (at a 1.5 °C warming) to 4.0% (at a 4.0 °C warming) using different machine learning models. Moreover, the extent of high susceptibility zones increases more significantly in the context of 4.0 °C warming when compared to the historical baseline results. These results indicate the importance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 as well as 2 °C. The high landslide susceptibility zones estimated by the CMIP6 multi-models ensemble are mainly located in the central and southeastern regions of the Hengduan Mountain Region. The possible changes in terms of introducing extreme precipitation in order to assess landslide susceptibility in the context of climate change that is proposed in this study may be further applied to additional study areas. These projections under different targets can provide scientific guidelines for the purposes of the development of climate change adaptation strategies. © 2023 by the authors.",Atmosphere,10.3390/atmos14020214,1,1,Yes,"GAM,RF,LGBM",,"China,South Korea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is important to understand or predict the probability of landslide occurrence at potentially risky sites. A commonly used means is to carry out a landslide susceptibility assessment based on a landslide inventory and a set of landslide contributing factors. This can be readily achieved using machine learning (ML) models such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), or deep learning (DL) models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short time memory (LSTM). As the input data for these models, landslide contributing factors have varying influences on landslide occurrence. Therefore, it is logically feasible to select more important contributing factors and eliminate less relevant ones, with the aim of increasing the prediction accuracy of these models. However, selecting more important factors is still a challenging task and there is no generally accepted method. Furthermore, the effects of factor selection using various methods on the prediction accuracy of ML and DL models are unclear. In this study, the impact of the selection of contributing factors on the accuracy of landslide susceptibility predictions using ML and DL models was investigated. Four methods for selecting contributing factors were considered for all the aforementioned ML and DL models, which included Information Gain Ratio (IGR), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operators (LASSO) and Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO). In addition, autoencoder-based factor selection methods for DL models were also investigated. To assess their performances, an exhaustive approach was adopted, testing all possible selection cases of contributing factors, the results of which served as the benchmark. The results confirmed that using more important contributing factors improved the prediction accuracy of the ML models considered. However, it was interesting to find that the selection of contributing factors using IGR and RFE reduced the predictive accuracy of the DL models. For the DL models, using an autoencoder architecture improved their prediction performance. The study also found that the choice of factor selection methods was far more effective than the selection of contributing factors in improving the prediction accuracy of landslide susceptibility. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,10.1007/s00477-023-02556-4,1,1,Yes,"LOGR,SVM,RF,XGB,CNN,RNN(LSTM)",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The obtained MLA results hold immense potential in the field of regional landslide mapping, facilitating the development of effective strategies aimed at minimizing the devastating impacts on human lives, infrastructure, and the natural environment. By leveraging these findings, proactive measures can be devised to safeguard vulnerable areas, mitigate risks, and ensure the safety and well-being of communities. Seven supervised MLA were employed, two regression algorithms (Logistic) and five decision tree algorithms (Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees [RPART], Conditional Inference Trees [CTREE], Random Forest [RF], Ranger, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm [XGBoost]). The LSMs were produced for each MLA. Considering different performance metrics, the RF model yields the best classification accuracy with an area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 95% and 90% of accuracy, providing the most representative results. Finally, the contribution of each landslide conditioning factor on predictions with RF model is explained using the SHAP method. © The Author(s) 2023.","Air, Soil and Water Research",10.1177/11786221231195824,1,1,Yes,"LOGR,XGB,RF",,Colombia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, 311 landslide points were identified through historical data, aerial interpretation, and field investigation to generate landslide inventory maps. Second, the landslide points were randomly divided into two groups (70%/30%) for training and validation. Then, 16 landslide conditioning factors were selected, namely slope aspect, slope angle, elevation, topographic roughness index (TRI), slope length (SL), convergence index (CI), terrain positioning index (TPI), profile curvature, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, lithology, soil, rainfall, land use, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Variance inflation factors (VIF), tolerance (TOL), and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) were used to detect potential multicollinearity problems between these factors. The performance of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under curve (AUC) methods. The areas under the curve obtained through WoE, LR, NB, and ADTree methods are 0.822, 0.833, 0.821, and 0.847 for the training dataset, and 0.888, 0.897, 0.898, and 0.823 for the validation dataset, respectively. The results show that the ADTree model has an overfitting state, so LR has the best balance performance. This also proves that advanced machine learning models do not necessarily perform better than traditional models. The results obtained will assist in the future identification of landslide areas to better manage and reduce the negative environmental impact of landslides. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment,10.1007/s10064-023-03216-1,1,1,Yes,"LR,NB,ADT",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed two novel ensemble frameworks, BagBFT and RFBFT, and the base model BFT, were used to model landslide susceptibility in Zhashui County (China), which suffers from landslides. Firstly, we identified 169 landslides through field surveys and image interpretation. Then, a landslide inventory map was built. These 169 historical landslides were randomly classified into two groups: 70% for training data and 30% for validation data. Then, 15 landslide conditioning factors were considered for mapping landslide susceptibility. The three ensemble outputs were estimated with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and statistical tests, as well as a new approach, the improved frequency ratio accuracy. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) for the training data (success rate) of the three algorithms were 0.722 for BFT, 0.869 for BagBFT, and 0.895 for RFBFT. The AUCs for the validating groups (prediction rates) were 0.718, 0.834, and 0.872, respectively. The frequency ratio accuracy of the three models was 0.76163 for the BFT model, 0.92220 for the BagBFT model, and 0.92224 for the RFBFT model. Both BagBFT and RFBFT ensembles can improve the accuracy of the BFT base model, and RFBFT was relatively better. Therefore, the RFBFT model is the most effective approach for the accurate modeling of landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). All three models can improve the identification of landslide-prone areas, enhance risk management ability, and afford more detailed information for land-use planning and policy setting. © 2023 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs15041007,1,1,Yes,"ROF,BFDT,BDT",,"China,Spain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary aim of the study is to investigate different machine learning methods and develop anatomy to train and validate the landslide susceptibility prediction models with the help of various statistical techniques. The Kullu–Rohtang pass transport corridor has been selected as the study area. Initially, a landslide inventory was prepared using different sources and nine landslide triggering features were used for further study. All landslide locations in the study area were arbitrarily divided into a ratio of 67:33 to train and test various landslide susceptibility prediction models. The best-triggering features were chosen with the help of the information gain ratio (IGR) defining the predictive capability of different triggering features. Afterwards, five landslide susceptibility prediction models were constructed using a decision tree, K-nearest neighbour (KNN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes, support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The comparison and validation study of different resulting models was done by applying the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the kappa index and other statistical methods. Results show that the different models have the outstanding predictive capability with the decision tree model (100%), the Gaussian Naïve Bayes model (100%), the SVM model (100%), and the MLP model (100%) and the KNN model (99.9%).

Supervised machine learning algorithms (ML) have become one of the most diffused techniques for landslide prediction, whose reliability is firmly based on the quality of input data. Site-specific landslide inventories are often more accurate and complete than national or worldwide databases. For these reasons, detailed landslide inventory and predisposing variables must be collected to derive reliable LS products. However, high-quality data are often rare, and risk managers must consider lower-resolution available products with no more than informative purposes. In this work, we compared different ML models to select the most accurate for large-scale LS assessment within the Municipality of Rome. The ExtraTreesClassifier outperformed the others reaching an average F1-score of 0.896. Thereafter, we addressed the reliability of open-source LS maps at different scales of analysis (global to regional) by means of statistical and spatial analysis. The obtained results shed light on the difference in hazard zoning depending on the scale and mapping unit.

However, the majority of machine learning models is considered “black box” models due to their lack of transparent explanations. In contrast, the QLattice model serves as a white box model, as it can elucidate the decision-making mechanism while representing a novel approach to whitening machine learning models. QLattice possesses the capability to automatically select and scale data features. In this study, Fengjie County in China was selected as the research area, with slope units serving as evaluation units. A geospatial database was constructed using 12 conditioning factors, including elevation, slope, and annual average rainfall. LSM models were conducted using both the QLattice and random forest (RF) algorithms. The findings demonstrate that the QLattice model achieved an area under curve value of 0.868, while the RF model attained an area under curve value of 0.849 for the test datasets. These results highlight the superior predictive ability and stability of the QLattice model compared with RF. Furthermore, QLattice can explicate and clarify the change processes of conditioning factors, thereby revealing the internal decision-making mechanism and causes behind the LSM model's decisions.

The findings indicate that: (1) The results demonstrate that for the same model, as the interval attribute value rises from 4 to 8 and finally to 20, the forecast accuracy of landslide susceptibility initially increases gradually, then progressively grows until stable. (2) The DBN model, followed by the RF and BP models, provides the highest prediction accuracy for the same interval attribute value.

Efficient Landslide Early Warning Systems (LEWS) are the best way to reduce the risk due to such events, but the number of operational LEWS is still limited. A new data-driven approach for spatio-temporal landslide forecasting on a regional scale is proposed, integrating Landslide Susceptibility Maps (LSMs) using RF algorithm and probabilistic hydro-meteorological thresholds, considering both rainfall severity and antecedent soil wetness. The proposed method is also compared with two deterministic process-based approaches: Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-based Regional Slope Stability (TRIGRS) and SHALSTAB, considering the spatial variability in soil thickness and properties, along with the rainfall data. The quantitative comparison is carried out for two test areas in the Western Ghats of India (Idukki and Wayanad), for two different spatial resolutions. The efficiency and area under the curve (AUC) values from a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were used to evaluate the performance of different models. The results for Idukki indicate that the efficiency values of the data-driven approach were improved by 4.67 % by using fine resolution DEM (digital elevation model) of 12.5 m resolution, while in the case of TRIGRS and SHALSTAB models, the improvements were 3.39 % and 1.83 %, respectively. For Wayanad, the improvement in efficiencies was further lesser, 2.59 % in the case of data-driven model, and 0.95 % and 0.73 % in the cases of TRIGRS and SHALSTAB, respectively.

Therefore, the landslide susceptibility prediction is generated, which can play an important role in the design of land development and urban development schemes in mountainous areas. In this paper, the frequency ratio (FR) model is used to quantitatively analyze the relationship between each factor and the occurrence of landslide (elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to faults, rainfall, distance to rivers, soil types, land cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and distance to roads). Based on the analysis of landslide distribution, 12 influencing factors were selected to establish the landslide susceptibility evaluation index system. Historical landslide points were randomly divided into training (70% of the total) and validation (30%) sets. Thereafter, decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF) models were used to generate the landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and the predictive performance of the three models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The FR model results showed that landslides mostly occurred at slopes of 0–15°, elevations of <1000 m, distance to rivers of 0–500 m, rainfall of 750–840 mm, NDVI of 0.8–0.9, distance to roads of 0–500 m, distance to faults of 1500–2000 m and transportation land.

However, owing to the rapid development of data-driven approaches, deep learning methods that can exhibit enhanced prediction accuracies have not been fully evaluated. Several researchers have compared different methods without optimizing them, whereas others optimized a single method using different algorithms and compared them. In this study, the performances of different fully optimized methods for landslide susceptibility mapping within the landslide-prone Kermanshah province of Iran were compared. The models, i.e., convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep neural networks (DNNs), and support vector machine (SVM) frameworks were developed using 14 conditioning factors and a landslide inventory containing 110 historical landslide points. The models were optimized to maximize the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), while maintaining their stability. The results showed that the CNN (accuracy = 0.88, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.37220, and AUC = 0.88) outperformed the DNN (accuracy = 0.79, RMSE = 0.40364, and AUC = 0.82) and SVM (accuracy = 0.80, RMSE = 0.42827, and AUC = 0.80) models using the same testing dataset.

A complete landslide inventory, which is essential but difficult to obtain, should include high-quality landslide and non-landslide samples. The insufficient number of landslide samples and the low purity of non-landslide samples limit the performance of the machine learning models. In response, this study aims to explore the effectiveness of isolated forest (IF) to solve the problem of insufficient landslide samples. IF belongs to unsupervised learning, and only a small share of landslide samples in the study area were required for modeling, while the remaining samples were used for testing. Its performance was compared to another advanced integration model, adaptive boosting integrated with decision tree (Ada-DT), which belongs to two-class classifiers (TCC) and needs a sufficient number of samples. Huangpu District, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province in China, was selected as the study area, and 13 predisposing factors were prepared for the modeling. Results showed that the IF proved its effectiveness with an AUC value of 0.875, although the Ada-DT model performed better (AUC = 0.921). IF outperformed the Ada-DT model in terms of recognizing landslides, and the sensitivity values of IF and the Ada-DT model were 90.00% and 86.67%, respectively, while the Ada-DT model performed better in terms of specificity. Two susceptibility maps obtained by the models were basically consistent with the field investigation, while the areas predicted by IF tended to be conservative as higher risk areas were presented, and the Ada-DT model was likely to be risky. It is suggested to select non-landslide samples from the very low susceptibility areas predicted by the IF model to form a more reliable sample set for Ada-DT modeling. The conclusion confirms the practicality and advancement of the idea of anomaly detection in LSP and improves the application potential of machine learning algorithms for geohazards. © 2022 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su142416692,2,1,Yes,"IF,AB",,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to the enormous threat to human life and property caused by the increasing number of mass movements, it is imperative to develop a reliable nationwide mass movement susceptibility model to identify mass movement-prone regions and formulate appropriate disaster prevention strategies. In recent years, the mixed-effects models have shown their unique advantages in dealing with the biased mass movement inventory, yet there are no relevant studies to compare different mixed-effects models. This research compared three mixed-effects models to explore the most plausible and robust susceptibility mapping model, considering the inherently heterogeneously complete mass movement information. Based on a preliminary data analysis, eight critical factors influencing mass movements were selected as basis predictors: the slope, aspect, profile curvature, plan curvature, road density, river density, soil moisture, and lithology. Two additional factors, namely, the land use and geological environment division, representing the inventory bias were selected as random intercepts. Subsequently, three mixed-effects models—Statistical-based generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM), generalized additive mixed-effects model (GAMM), and machine learning-based tree-boosted mixed-effects model (TBMM)—were adopted. These models were used to evaluate the susceptibility of three distinct types of mass movements (i.e., 28,814 debris flows, 54,586 rockfalls and 108,432 landslides), respectively. The results were compared both from quantitative and qualitative perspectives. The results showed that TBMM performed best in all three cases with AUROCs (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) of cross-validation, spatial cross-validation, and predictions on simulated highly biased inventory, all exceeding 0.8. In addition, the spatial prediction patterns of TBMM were more in line with the natural geomorphological underlying process, indicating that TBMM can better reduce the impact of inventory bias than GLMM and GAMM. Finally, factor contribution analysis showed the key role of topographic factors in predicting the occurrence of mass movements, followed by road density and soil moisture. This study contributes to assessing China’s overall mass movement susceptibility situation and assisting policymakers in master planning for risk mitigation. Further, it demonstrates the tremendous potential of TBMM for mass movement susceptibility assessment, despite inherent biases in the inventory. © 2022 by the authors.",Remote Sensing,10.3390/rs14236068,1,1,Yes,GBM,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These types of floods are mostly associated with landslides and erosion of roads within a short time.Most of Vietnamis hilly and mountainous; thus, the problem due to flash flood is severe and requires systematic studies to correctly identify flood susceptible areas for proper landuse planning and traffic management. In this study, three Machine Learning (ML) methods namely Deep Learning Neural Network (DL), Correlation-based Feature Weighted Naive Bayes (CFWNB), and Adaboost (AB-CFWNB) were used for the development of flash flood susceptibility maps for hilly road section (115 km length) of National Highway (NH)-6 inHoa Binh province, Vietnam. In the proposedmodels, 88 past flash flood events were used together with 14 flash floods affecting topographical and geo-environmental factors. The performance of themodels was evaluated using standard statisticalmeasures including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, Area Under Curve (AUC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results revealed that all the models performed well (AUC > 0.80) in predicting flash flood susceptibility zones, but the performance of the DL model is the best (AUC: 0.972, RMSE: 0.352). Therefore, the DL model can be applied to develop an accurate flash flood susceptibility map of hilly terrain which can be used for proper planning and designing of the highways and other infrastructure facilities besides landuse management of the area. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Heterogeneous and homogeneous ensemble types can be distinguished; four ensembles of each approach were implemented in the Djebahia region. The heterogeneous ensembles include stacking (ST), voting (VO), weighting (WE), and a new approach in landslide assessment called meta-dynamic ensemble selection (DES), while the homogeneous ensembles include AdaBoost (ADA), bagging (BG), random forest (RF), and random subspace (RSS). To ensure a consistent comparison, each ensemble was implemented using individual base learners. The heterogeneous ensembles were generated by combining eight different machine learning algorithms, while the homogeneous ensembles only used a single base learner, with diversity achieved through resampling the training dataset. The spatial dataset used in this study consisted of 115 landslide events and 12 conditioning factors, which were randomly divided into training and testing datasets. The models were evaluated through various aspects, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, root mean squared error (RMSE), landslide density distribution (LDD), threshold-dependent metrics (Kappa index, accuracy, and recall scores), and a global visual representation using the Taylor diagram. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis (SA) was conducted for the best performing models to assess the importance of the factors and the resilience of the ensembles. The results revealed that homogeneous ensembles outperformed heterogeneous ensembles in terms of AUC and threshold-dependent metrics, with AUC ranging from 0.962 to 0.971 for the test dataset. ADA was the best performing model for these metrics and the least in terms of RMSE (0.366). However, the heterogeneous ensemble ST provided a finer RMSE (0.272), and DES showed the best LDD, indicating a stronger potential to generalize the phenomenon. The Taylor diagram was consistent with the other results, indicating that ST was the best performing model, followed by RSS. The SA demonstrated that RSS was the most robust (mean AUC variation of − 0.022) and ADA was the least robust (mean AUC variation of − 0.038). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1007/s11356-023-26247-3,1,1,Yes,"AB,BDT,RF,RSS",,Algeria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based landslide susceptibility mapping models do not adequately take into account the spatial nature of texture features, and vision transformer (ViT)-based LSM models have high requirements for the amount of training data. In this study, we overcome the shortcomings of CNN and ViT by fusing these two deep learning models (bottleneck transformer network (BoTNet) and convolutional vision transformer network (ConViT)), and the fused model was used to predict the probability of landslide occurrence. First, we integrated historical landslide data and landslide evaluation factors and analysed whether there was covariance in the landslide evaluation factors. Then, the testing accuracy and generalisation ability of the CNN, ViT, BoTNet and ConViT models were compared and analysed. Finally, four landslide susceptibility mapping models were used to predict the probability of landslide occurrence in Pingwu County, Sichuan Province, China. Among them, BoTNet and ConViT had the highest accuracy, both at 87.78%, an improvement of 1.11% compared to a single model, while ConViT had the highest F1-socre at 87.64%, an improvement of 1.28% compared to a single model. The results indicate that the fusion model of CNN and ViT has better LSM performance than the single model. Meanwhile, the evaluation results of this study can be used as one of the basic tools for landslide hazard risk quantification and disaster prevention in Pingwu County. © 2022 by the authors.",Sensors,10.3390/s23010088,1,1,Yes,"ViT,BTN,CNN",,"China,Czech Republic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To mitigate these hazards, scientists employ landslide susceptibility mapping that evaluates zones prone to landslides and identifies contributing factors. This study aimed to introduce ensemble landslide susceptibility models based on a statistical model (analytical hierarchy process) and a machine learning model (support vector machine) for predicting landslides in a part of the Darjeeling district, West Bengal, India. A total of 114 landslide locations were identified and randomly divided into training and validation databases, with proportions of 70% and 30%, respectively. Ten conditioning factors were considered, including rainfall, soil texture, slope, aspect, geomorphology, lithology, curvature, land use and land cover, drainage density, and lineament density. The AHP-SVM model, employing linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid function algorithms, was applied using the training landslide and non-landslide datasets along with the spatial database of conditioning factors. Four landslide susceptibility maps were generated using this model, and their accuracy was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) tool with the validation dataset. Among the four ensemble methods tested (AHP-SVM_Sigmoid, AHP-SVM_RBF, AHP-SVM_Polynomial, and AHP-SVM_Linear), the AHP-SVM_Sigmoid model demonstrated the highest degree-of-fit and prediction performance, achieving a prediction capability of 86.2%. Consequently, it is concluded that the AHP-SVM_Sigmoid ensemble model holds promise as a novel technique for spatial landslide prediction in future studies. The findings of this study are valuable for local planning and decision-makers and can be utilized to implement landslide susceptibility methods in other regions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,10.1007/s00477-023-02528-8,1,1,Yes,SVM,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have comparatively analyzed landslide susceptibility by employing integrated geospatial approaches, i.e., data-driven, knowledge-driven, andmachine learning (ML), along themain road corridors of the Muzaffarabad district. The landslide inventory of three road corridors is developed to evaluate landslide susceptibility, and eleven landslide causative factors (LCFs) were analyzed. After statistical significance analysis, these eleven LCFs generated susceptibility models using WoE, AHP, LR, and RF. Distance from roads, landcover, lithological units, and slopes are considered more influential LCFs. The performancematrix of different LSMs is evaluated through the area under the curve (AUC-ROC), overall accuracy, Kappa index, F1 score, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Square Error. The AUC-ROC for WoE, AHP, LR, and RF techniques along Neelumroad is 0.86, 0.82, 0.91, and 0.97, respectively, along Jhelum Valley road is 0.83, 0.81, 0.93, and 0.95, respectively, while along Kohala road is 0.89, 0.88, 0.89, and 0.92, respectively. The produced LSMs through ML (i.e., RF and LR) showed better prediction accuracies than WoE and AHP along these three road corridors. The LSMs are categorized into very high, high, moderate, and low susceptible zones along these roads. The LSM generated through hybrid models can facilitate the concerned local agencies to implement landslide mitigation policies for the landslideprone zones along road corridors. © 2022 the author(s).",Open Geosciences,10.1515/geo-2022-0424,2,1,Yes,"LR,RF",,"Pakistan,Viet Nam,China,Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
